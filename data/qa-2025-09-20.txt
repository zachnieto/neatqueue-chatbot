Can i add multiple players to the queue with out them doing it?
Can i see the bracket as a image or on the website?
Answer: Yes to all as far as I know.

Question: <@857633321064595466> stats
Answer: > ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.

Question: Quick question, if I had a party queue set for 5v5, and one party had example 10 players, would all 10 players need to join the queue channel for it to continue through the voting, or just 5?

Question: because the process is important:

I needed to re-apply the Team vs Team with no requirement for matching number, and just upped the team limit to 10. you will also need to set the /readyup mode to disable

Question: your example URLs are formed like `subdomain.challonge.com/url` ?

Question: your example URLs are formed like `subdomain.challonge.com/url` ?
Answer: OK, so I quickly went to test the API and sending the parameter ``tournament[subdomain]:{domain here}`` created the tournament within the community:

This did not happen with the previous queue (which did not have the `false` option being toggled), until I had newly set it up again via `/setup`.

Have also set the `/timer queuereset` to 604800 to have the queue reset in 1 week, not sure if this would have led to that issue? Or would a user's Discord status set to `Idle` affect this?

**EDIT:** Another thing that I had noticed was that I did not get booted for inactivity even after logging off Discord for 2 hours or not checking my Discord for 30 minutes. But my status is set to `Do Not Disturb` permanently ü§î
Answer: if people are already in queue the afk timer might still affect them


Question: if people are already in queue the afk timer might still affect them
Answer: oh, the afk timer still affects them even if I've toggled it to be `false`? Because that didn't happen in our previous queue hmmm


Question: what do you mean about not getting booted for inactivity?
Answer: like if I don't check Discord for 30 mins or go offline for like an hour or so I'm still in the queue and not removed for inactivity like this (user's name in Chinese is me):

Question: ** **
** **
So we are wanting to do a very large draft tournament. We want to have a queue open at least a couple of hours in advance so people have a good window to sign up for it. The biggest issue for me is that when you join two queues, and one of them starts, you get taken out of the other queue pool. Idk if this is due to us using server-wide stats, or what, or if there's simply a setting I can adjust. I want people to be able to queue up in the tournament queue, while also being able to play in the regular queue.
Answer: good point, it should stop removing automatically from tournament queues


Question: if i reset the stats, wouldn't that reset the mmr?
Answer: I could be wrong, but I'm fairly certain that the stats are tied to that queue name. So whatever mmr they've earned in that queue is separate.
NeatZ will probably correct me lol


Question: 
Answer: The queue names here just represent all the unique stats names that currently have some data


Question: good point, it should stop removing automatically from tournament queues
Answer: Well we wouldn't be doing a tournament queue. With tournament queues, you have to join with a team, and it doesn't draft. Correct? Or is there a way to draft in the tournament queue?

Idk if this is due to us using server-wide stats, or what, or if there's simply a setting I can adjust. I want people to be able to queue up in the tournament queue, while also being able to play in the regular queue.
Answer: So is there a way to do what I mentioned with a regular queue? Where you can queue up in multiple queues that are running instead of being pulled out? If it's a setting thing, I would only turn it on when we do these large drafts with a large sign-up period


Question: The queue names here just represent all the unique stats names that currently have some data
Answer: how do i delete one of them?


Question: by resetting stats for that queue
Answer: so basically all the data would be wiped


Question: currently no, i can add a setting to disable automatically removing from other queues
Answer: This would be amazing. Is this easy, or would I need to wait a while for it? I'm perfectly fine with either. Just curious

If i keep rolling stats, how do monthly leaderboards work? Is there like a tracker (that has pictures or screenshots) that shows the end of month stats for each month? Also do ALL stats get removed (mmr & wins) orr?

Question: <@857633321064595466> stats
Answer: > ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.

Question: I setted server role PUG Spectator as BOT Spectator role
1. PUG Spectator role has server permission to join channels and to speak in them.
2. BOT Spectator role has enable to speak False so he doesn't speak in other's teams voice chat

Answer: have you gotten around to checking? or if you think it would be a good catch all do use the tempchannel/voicechannel permissions to allow the "player league" role to connect/speak (I've never used this command so unsure if this would open the 5 person limit and connection restriction)

Question: <@857633321064595466> stats
Answer: > ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.

Question: Currently the only way to confirm that you are present at a match is by joining a vc, is there a way to make it clicking a present button instead of joining the vc?
Answer: `/queueentry methods`


Question: `/queueentry methods`
Answer: No that‚Äôs how you join the queue, I‚Äôm wondering if there is a way to make it a button when accepting the match. Btw it‚Äôs for a team vs team if that helps


Question: No that‚Äôs how you join the queue, I‚Äôm wondering if there is a way to make it a button when accepting the match. Btw it‚Äôs for a team vs team if that helps
Answer: Oh yeah i confused commands `/readyup mode`


Question: If a match broke, there is nothing you can do to fix, just requeue and try again
Answer: So, after captains are chosen, they are supposed to be able to choose then after they choose. Thats when a new queue can be started, but the capts cant select so the new one never pops up and trying to restart the queue manually just pops up with "This server is only allowed 3 different queues. Let the server staff know to upgrade to premium to allow more queues!"

Question: How do I reset everybody's MMR in one and/or all leaderboards?
Answer: `/managestats reset all`
This will reset mmr, streaks, games played, etc.


Question: `/managestats reset all`
This will reset mmr, streaks, games played, etc.
Answer: Would it be possible to not have games played removed?


Question: Also, is there a command to set everybody's MMR to a certain amount?
Answer: If everyone has a certain role, you could use:
`/set mmr mmr:0 role:`


Question: If everyone has a certain role, you could use:
`/set mmr mmr:0 role:`
Answer: Oh so if they have a certain role such as *Member*, it would set their starting MMR as 1000 (if set as 1000)?


Question: Oh so if they have a certain role such as *Member*, it would set their starting MMR as 1000 (if set as 1000)?
Answer: Yes, but that would *technically* be
`/startingmmr set mmr:1000 role:Member`

However, idk how that would affect people who already have mmr. I don't *think* it would reset it, but if you reset the stats and someone plays a queue, they would for sure start with 1,000.

As for the `/set mmr` command, idk how that affects people who leave the server and come back. For instance, if someone leaves and comes back and a reset hasn't occurred, I'm pretty sure their mmr will go back to normal. If a reset had happened, it won't.

So idk what happens if someone leaves the server, the role they used to have is set to 0, and they come back.

That's technically above my pay grade lol. I'm just a guy in Best Buy who happens to be wearing a blue shirt üòÇ

Question: We talked about this this past weekend (link here: <https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/857677776471588894/1244051625610444800>), but I'd like to bring it up again.

One thing you mentioned was this:
> that queue embed is hacked together to show a large number of characters
> but the captains embed is not the same type
> i can try and see if swapping just works, when are you starting it?

So is there a way a special draft mode could be made that takes advantage of multiple embeds, or something similar? We would love to use the bot for our draft tournaments instead of an Excel sheet, but I also understand that there's going to be a limit to things. I'm mainly wanting to pick your brain and hopefully come up with something.

If you would like me to put this in feature requests instead, I can. Maybe request something like "Make a draft type that doesn't have a character limit"?
Answer: Yea i mean sending multiple embeds would be 1 solution, ill try and find time to take a look


Question: Is there a way for the leaderboard of the team queue to have the name of the team/party? instead of the party leader's discord name? To keep track of the results

Answer: The parties might be on the same team, depends how teams are picked


Question: ** **

Also (and this will probably be much easier to answer), we have been manually resetting all stats at the end of the month. I just realized that there are monthly stats. If we go to monthly stats, once the stats reset, can we go back and see the previous month's stats? I'm assuming it's not retroactive, but we reward the top players at the end of the month, so being able to see the final standings at the end of the month, post-reset, would be needed if we did the monthly stats.
Answer: Bumping this since there was a lot

Question: This is for  FIFA pro clubs. Teams have 11 spots each available on the game itself, but I want them to be able to start a game as long as they have 4 players each. So for example, one party of 4 might enter the queue, fully ready to play against another party who queues with a full 11. Does this make more sense?
Answer: did it work for you?

Question: I‚Äôm looking for a bot that can make private matches in the game ‚Äúthe finals‚Äù can anyone tell me if this bot would work for that?
Answer: I honestly have no idea what that game is, but if you're able to create private matches or have your own server inside the game, then you should be able to use the bot. You can have captains make their teams and queue up that way, you can have people join in as individuals with an option to choose a role or not, and more. It's a pretty freaking awesome bot

Answer: You are able to create private matches in the game, how would the bot be able to do that though?


Question: You are able to create private matches in the game, how would the bot be able to do that though?
Answer: With no former knowledge on your game, I'm going to be hypothetical and say it's 5v5 with no designated roles.

You create a lobby with 2 teams, 5 players each. You can set multiple different variables within this. Some people use matchmaking, where it won't let you play with someone who has a ranking too far away from yours. Others (like myself) have a straight fill system that will start as soon as enough people to fill both teams starts up.

You can set captains by a vote, random, or even no captains and let the bot split the teams by their ranking, randomly, etc.

The bot makes the teams, the teams decide how to play each other in-game, and they vote on the winner.

There's a lot more to it than that, but I feel like that's the basic gist from my experience with it.

Question: Hello, I have a "THE FINALS" queue where 4 teams join and they go into a map ban and then into a specialization (hero) ban. I was wondering if there was a way to make it so teams cannot see what other teams are in queue or if there was a way to randomize ban order. 

Right now how it works is that the first team that joins the queue gets first map ban and first hero ban with the last team getting last map ban and last hero ban respectively. 

I want to avoid scenarios where teams will try to be the last team in order to gain a ban advantage.
Answer: there isn't really any way to hide who a team is playing against

Answer: Also, if there's a way to have a custom autoping message that'd be desirable as well. In my server we'd want the message to say what the exact queue size is (e.g. 2 out of 6) bc people will by default assume it's just 1


Question: that works by default if you have /tempchannels enabled
Answer: Temps are enabled and I had 10 more people join the queue and it "created" but nothing happened and it cleared the queue


Question: Maybe it was a bug?
Answer: Okay, maybe it was a bug, I just did /test (didn't know was a thing üòÖ) and it made another queue


Question: -d bestof
Answer: Tested it now but it‚Äôs not really what i meant. They have two maps now with best of 2 but it should be only 1 map


Question: As example:

After they banned it should be possible as it is shown in the screen but then only one map should get picked not like here two
Answer: if you want 1 map, then it should be a best of 1

Question: for some reason, the queue resets basically every single time it fills up, making some people who were already in the queue miss it because they didnt requeue after the queue reset. Why does the queue reset like that?

Question: for some reason, the queue resets basically every single time it fills up, making some people who were already in the queue miss it because they didnt requeue after the queue reset. Why does the queue reset like that?
Answer: what is your queue type?


Question: matchmaking, pugs, etc
Answer: pugs


Question: when you switch queue types it will empty the queue
Answer: yes but the issue is that consistently for the past 100 or so queues after we switched it from matchmaking to pugs it has cleared the queue after becoming 8/8 players almost every time


Question: idk if im explaining it well, it's like the queue is 6/8 and there is 1 queue currently in progress, after the in progress queue ends, the 6/8 fills up to 8/8, but instead of starting a queue, it resets the queue back to 0/8 and everyone who was queued would have to requeue, and as a result many of them are skipped or dont queue in time because they weren't expecting the queue to reset
Answer: Could you share your config and Ill take a look (/config save)


Question: 
Answer: I tried these steps:
- Fill up a queue with 8 people
- Complete match setup
- Fill up the queue with 6 people
- Vote for the winner of the first match
- Add 2 more people to the queue, and it creates a new match with the 8 people, resetting to 0/8 players

Answer: <@857633321064595466> stats


Question: <@857633321064595466> stats
Answer: > ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.

Answer: <@857633321064595466> stats


Question: <@857633321064595466> stats
Answer: > ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.

Question: I need some help with `/api/v2/selectwinner` https://api.neatqueue.com/docs#/Commands/outcome_selectwinner_api_v2_outcome_selectwinner_post

I calling the API like this:
```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.neatqueue.com/api/v2/selectwinner \
  --header 'Authorization: <REDACTED>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"channel_id": 1287870121196523581,"match_number": 2250,"team_num": 0}'
```

And I'm getting the values out of the `TEAMS_CREATED` webhook payload, but I'm always getting 404 `{"detail":"Not Found"}`.

I tried passing the values as strings, and the bot (https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/1131752660740083763/1288010233842761758) said to omit the "channel_id" field, but it's also not working. Any idea what could be wrong?

Answer: Thats not possible


Question: is <#1287870121196523581> a valid channel on your end when this happens?
Answer: Yep, that's the confusing part to me. I have an automation that sends a message to the channel with information about the match. And the message goes trough, if I use the same channel ID to call the API it returns 404. So I wonder if the format is correct should it be `1287870121196523581` or `"1287870121196523581"` or ???

I tried both and it didn't work

Question: I'm not able to formulate my question properly so the bot understands me this time, but our server is getting quite busy. And often people don't vote for the winner and we end up having channels open for a long time.

Question: Setting up a new queue for the first time in a while. Anybody know off the top of their head what command changed the language from "Players in Queue: 0" to "Queue 0/2"
Answer: -d queuetype


Question: 
Answer: Alright, we've been having a similar problem for the past couple of hours. We tried adding a third queue channel (we have two that work currently). We made it by duplicating an existing queue channel that works, then running /setup and setting everything up just the same (as far as I know). The private tempchannels that this new 3rd queue creates seem identical to the tempchannels created by the other 2 queues, but the new one gives the "Permissions Error: Manage Channels." But from what we can tell, the channels are set up identically in every way.

Question: <@857633321064595466> stats
Answer: > ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.


Question: you need to re-sync the general queue stats
Answer: How do I do this? 
If I run ``/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set: player_stats`` in the primary queue channel, then the games from that queue will go back to updating the original stats?


Question: next time it breaks we can also compare to see if the token changed

Answer: so if server shared state serverwide is enabled i can have 3 different queue names with the same stats?


Question: If u enable server wide, all your queues, even if the names are not the same, will shate stats
Answer: it give me 1 queue option to name the leaderboard to


Question: like if i made a queue with the name "2v2 and another queue with the name "4v4 can i make them share the same stats and points
Answer: I think this would work using the ‚Äússerverwide‚Äù command so long as you don‚Äôt have any other queues outside of that that you don‚Äôt want to include.

But if you had say 2 different games eg rocket league & call of duty. Then you couldn‚Äôt use ‚Äúserverwide‚Äù you‚Äôd had to use ‚Äúset‚Äù and the problem with that (I think) is that you would have to call the queues the same name to share the stats, but I don‚Äôt think you can configure them differently? So if you changed the queue configuration to something different, it would change the config of all the queues with the same name?


Question: it give me 1 queue option to name the leaderboard to
Answer: For example you have one queue named X, this queue has some stats, if in the serverwide name parameter u give the name X, then the stats being saved in that queue now will be applied to all queues, then all queues will share stats


Question: For example you have one queue named X, this queue has some stats, if in the serverwide name parameter u give the name X, then the stats being saved in that queue now will be applied to all queues, then all queues will share stats
Answer: But can you have two different configurations when you have named them the same queue name?


Question: Like say you had one channel named 2v2 & another 4v4 and gave them the same queue name so they share stats. Can you configure them differently
Answer: <@648635725964902411>


Question: For example you have one queue named X, this queue has some stats, if in the serverwide name parameter u give the name X, then the stats being saved in that queue now will be applied to all queues, then all queues will share stats
Answer: even if the queues are in different channels? like i create a chat with the name 2v2 and another chat with the name 4v4 and i want them to share stats

Question: Good evening, I am using the command I am using the command /autoroles leaderboardposition set [role] [stat] [lower_value] (upper_value) to create roles based on the MMR, which command do I use to create the role that the command argument asks me for?
Answer: The role its just a discord role


Question: The role its just a discord role
Answer: I have another question, I use the argument:

/autoroles leaderboardposition set role:@Silver I (S1) stat:MMR lower_value:1 upper_value:199(To assign the lowest rank which in this case would be silver 2).

The question is that using the same argument but now with the role Silver 2(Rank 200-399MMR), this role is not assigned to the user who has that amount of MMR and the previous role is not eliminated(Silver 1). The same with the higher ranks


Question: it‚Äôs not talking about 0-199 MMR, it‚Äôs position on the leaderboard
Answer: So how do I declare them to use the MMR/Points? I'm sorry if I'm annoying, I've been using Discord bots for a short time.

Question: I‚Äôm not sure if this was mentioned already or not but is there anyway to fix this?

Whenever someone with priority joins, it moves the other person with priority who was queued up before, to the middle of the line instead of reorganizing them to 1st and 2nd in line.

For reference, we have multiple levels of priority. Sant! has highest priority, and Juanpa has next to highest, in regards to those queued up.
Answer: are you sure about their priorities? It should definitely insert based on the value


Question: are you sure about their priorities? It should definitely insert based on the value
Answer: The photo is of the priorities I've made.

Everyone from Juanpa to Silva was moved behind Sebasabramo when Sant! entered. So it somehow moved 5 people to the back of the line, not just 1.


Question: How to unlock the situation?
Answer: If you have the perms, you can use `/outcome cancel match_number:` or something like that to end the queue. You should be able to see the match number wherever results are posted

Everyone from Juanpa to Silva was moved behind Sebasabramo when Sant! entered. So it somehow moved 5 people to the back of the line, not just 1.
Answer: does the queue still look like that? Or do you have a match number i can check against?


Question: does the queue still look like that? Or do you have a match number i can check against?
Answer: I tested something else real quick. It apparently doesn't matter which role is joined.

Alisha should be first in line, unless I join. If I join, they should be second. Regardless of which role I joined up as, they were moved to the middle of the pack, along with the 6 people immediately after them before I joined.

I don't have a match number for it, since it's just the lobby waiting for 22 people. But I just saved a config for it, if that helps.

Question: and the same channel shows different MMR on /stats and /leaderboard ?
Answer: so if I do the /leaderboard command, the embed shows the correct MMR and win / loss. but the website leaderboard has a bunch of people stuck at 1000 MMR and this never changes but their W/L does. 
take a look at player ``e, HuggingThor, nate`` for example. 
I run the command in the channel linked to the proper queue and monthly is disabled.

Answer: There‚Äôs two ways of joining a queue right? Either by clicking the join queue button or by joining the voice channel. But we removed the button option as it creates problem in our project.
But then when people create a party and join voice channel, the bot does not detect them and do not take the players in the party in the queue

Question: Hey I've had some issues with certain bad actor players trying to ruin the experience for others. Specifically, when there are enough players in queue (lets say 6, for my queue games must be played 3v3, 4v4, or 5v5), the bad actor joins queue to make it imbalanced. Then if another player joins to make it 8, the bad actor leaves. So if none of my staff is around to ban the player from queue, he can completely shut down games. Is there anything that I can do to prevent this? Maybe a command to make it if a player joins and leaves queue a certain amount of times in a set period of time, they get a short temp ban?
Answer: that‚Äôs an interesting idea, how often are they joining and leaving?


Question: that‚Äôs an interesting idea, how often are they joining and leaving?
Answer: I havent seen it but I dont think they are completely spamming it. Probably varies in pace depending on how many people are in queue already. I'd assume it would have to be something along the lines of banning them if they join/leave queue X number of times before a game gets created

Question: <@857633321064595466> stats
Answer: > ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.

Question: If I use the `ordered` argument for `/gamemode selection` what order does it actually use? I don't see an option to select the order. 

More context: I would like to have modes be in a specific order, and then maps be selected by least frequent and remove voting on maps and modes all together to speed up the process.
Answer: it should pop up and ask you for the order after you use the command


Question: it should pop up and ask you for the order after you use the command
Answer: I'll try that and report back if I have any issues. Thanks!


Question: it should pop up and ask you for the order after you use the command
Answer: Yep. it works. Thanks again. Halo Infinite, sadly, makes it more complicated than I think I can configure in NQ. In a best of 5, the standard order is OBJ, Slayer, OBJ, OBJ, Slayer. Unfortunately, there are 5 OBJ modes. So, while I could define the two Slayers, I would not be able to define the others without leaving out two. I thought about defining the mode order and then creating custom vote menus for the three OBJs but that's not exactly simpler that just using mode voting. Open to any creative ideas I may be missing though!

Question: Hello! Is it possible to make 2 separate leaderboards within one server, each of which will be linked to its own queue?

I've been trying to do it myself by documentation for a few hours now and I've managed to make 2 different queues with different rules, but when starting any of them, the rating is summarized in the one leaderboard....
Answer: Did u enable serverwide stats?


Question: Did u enable serverwide stats?
Answer: Is this some kind of command? I just haven't found any info on it.....

And no, I have two channels for two queue and two the channels to leaderborads with links (4 channels sum)


Question: Are the queues named the same?
Answer: Nope


Question: Oh, I did it!

I split each queue into a separate role and they split into different leaderborads. But now there's a problem.

I have Role #1 and Role #2, and if in one of the queues only Role #1 can participate and in the other one Role #1 and Role #2 can participate, then for the match in the queue where there are 2 roles, elo is given to both leaderboards.
Answer: Disable ir

Question: I think there's an issue with the mmr in my server, and I can't figure it out.

The first image is the current leaderboard. It shows first place with 631. Second image shows the peak mmr, but they're at 576, which is lower.

Question: <@857633321064595466> stats
Answer: > ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.


Question: <@145305657237700608> We have solved the problem that Houdini talked about. But now when creating a lobby where people gather in a voice chat (captains choose players, ban maps). In this temporary voice channel and in subsequent channels (head channels of two teams), user restrictions have disappeared. During picks and bans, anyone can enter, there is no limit of 10 people. And there is also no limit of 5 users in teams.

Question: Is it possible to have a mixture of a role and team queue together. What I mean by this‚Ä¶. 2 teams in a queue, where roles would need to be selected. The roles queue as seen on this site, prompt you to choose a role when joining. I want to be able to setup a queue with 2 teams, have roles needed to be chosen but only one role per team and up to 11 roles per team. Then if someone leaves the queue, that role is selectable by the person who joins again
Answer: like this? <#915812742865231912>


Question: like this? <#915812742865231912>
Answer: Oh wow ye‚Ä¶ I would look to do this for up to 11 roles per team‚Ä¶ my terminology would be positions but in this context roles, as we would have two football teams. So hopefully this will work how I‚Äôm thinking, seems to from what you did. Thanks for the quick response.  Is there a way of having unranked casual and ranked and it track what role they were playing?


Question: No theres no tracking/stats for specific roles
Answer: Ok‚Ä¶ is there anyway to stop them choosing a role on a different team unless they have left the role on the existing team Example. If I click team 1 role x and then click team 2 role y, I am in both teams and from a game perspective that isn‚Äôt possible and I would be blocking a space in the other team.


Question: will give this a test, thanks.. is there a way to handle min and max participants (outside of the part feature). example in the scenario above, we have team select on join, and we define each team to have 11 players each. We would then have to wait for 11 on each to join before it starts, or is there a way to setup if it gets to 8 per team it can or if it goes to the vote of the players to decide if they wanted to start whilst waiting for others to join the queue.
Answer: -d forcestartconfig conditions


Question: -d forcestartconfig conditions
Answer: that is great, thank you. is it possible to allow the players to vote to start if over min_size? i believe it is, example "Players can force start with 20 players" the scenario i am trying to get around for 11 v 11 with predifened roles, is the majority of times, we wont have a GK join, but there will be times when they will. This could hold up the queue starting as 10v10 for all those roles (except gk) would be fine, but then if someone did choose GK and there was a different role still to be chosen, the game would automatically be forced to start. Alternatively, if i set the queue to 10v10 then gk roles could miss out playing in the queue. i hope that is clear. thanks

Answer: are you the one who purchased the credits?


Question: Is there any more documentation on how the different captain picking orders work? (1-1-1-1-1 e.t.c.)
We're drafting captains for a game called Deadlock which is played 6v6, and we're struggling alot with captain balance.
The current setup is that we vote for captains. When two captains are selected, the first one drafts one player. Then, if that drafted first player has high enough mmr, the second captains gets 2 picks (if he drafts the first player under a threshold mmr). This feature is not documented anywhere and doesnt seem to be configurable. 
Also, sometimes the first player gets to draft 2 players back to back, and the reason for that seems to be very random.
Is it possible to make a configurable setting for captain drafting, and not just the standard modes that are available? None of them seem balanced and the one we got now is the most "balanced" we can do for 6v6
Answer: Yeah, its not configurable

Players that are "afk" whilst queued up, receive this direct message from NeatQueue (the one in image is from a time I did not respond, to show the blue button) , when they click the "Im Here!" button, the button disappears but the player is still kicked 5 minutes later.

The command "/timer afk true timer [time]" is set, yet players are still being kicked? The "im here" button should stop the players from being kicked no?

The 6 minutes of inactivity image, is when i was testin the afk timer with 6 minutes. I recieved a dm saying i would be removed in 5 minutes due to inactivity, and asked me to click the button. I clicked it, and then I was kicked anyway...

Question: Is it possible to manually change captains after they've been selected within the context of a match?

The flow would be:
1) No parties have been created.
2) Players join queue.
3) Match is created
4) Players vote for captain using the Voting option
5) Chosen captain does not want to be captain. We need to switch that person with someone else

I know that the /party captain command exists, but since we don't have parties to begin with, I don't think that applies in this scenario
Answer: Is not possible, but there should be the possibility of shuffling again the captain, did u disable that option?


Question: Is not possible, but there should be the possibility of shuffling again the captain, did u disable that option?
Answer: I tested with reshuffling enabled, but I don't see any option that allows it. In my scenario, players vote for a captain, that vote passes / completes, and captains are assigned. Then, before players are selected, I want to substitute one captain with another player.

I don't see any option for this, even with reshuffling enabled

Answer: reshuffle only applies to random seletion


Question: reshuffle only applies to random seletion
Answer: Is there any other workaround you can think of for the situation? The only options I can think of are:
1) The person remains captain, but someone else picks on their behalf in VC
2) We cancel the match and start over (which wouldn't work if other people are already in queue).


Question: is it possible to allow players to join the next queue if they already voted for previous queue but the queue isnt submitted yet?

Question: <@145305657237700608> I currently have a queue which I think uses player_stats. I want to start a new season but want to keep the old stats which can be checked by a leaderboard. Is it possible to carry over the current player_stats to a new season_1 stats and then keep the player_stats in memory to act as a season 0, such that season_1 stats continue updating but player_stats doesnt? Is it also possible to rename player_stats to season_0 for convenience?

tldr: I want to rename the current player_stats to season_0. I then want to implement seasons into the queue such that each season follows on from the last but the old season stats do not change. I also want to make a "legacy leaderboards" channel where there are multiple leaderboards for the old seasons if possible.

If any of this is possible, how would/should I go about it?

Question: Quick question is there the possibility to create a full team vs full team queue without MMR? Would want it to be more a training than matchmaking. For cups etc.
Answer: you can set the /mmr change to 0


Question: On our server, we just did an MMR reset. I would like the autoroles to update to reflect the post-reset MMR, but whenever I try to use /autoroles refresh, it keeps the roles from before the reset, even though the NeatQueue bot says, ‚ÄúSuccessfully checked/modified roles for X players.‚Äù

Is there a specific reason why /autoroles refresh isn't working? Could it be because the user already has an autorole that is higher in the role hierarchy than the one that should be assigned during the refresh?
Answer: depends on how stats were reset but probably because the players are no longer in the queue's "system" so it doesn't manage their roles


Question: depends on how stats were reset but probably because the players are no longer in the queue's "system" so it doesn't manage their roles
Answer: Yeah that was the problem, is there a way to set everyone's mmr to a certain value? Should this command work? And after, I do /autoroles refresh?


Question: All commands and interactions with the bot are suddenly resulting in this error message, this has been going on for 10 minutes now
Answer: happening for me too


Question: This isn't happening for just me, its happening for everyone in the server I am in
Answer: it fix or what


Question: -d autoping
Answer: is there any way i can add messages into the auto ping rather than it just pinging the roles only?


Question: you can set the /mmr change to 0
Answer: Ah okay thanks!


Question: Does anyone know if there's a way to send players to a selected channel when the match ends? Because look, I set it so that in the 'espera mix' channel they join the queue as soon as they enter, but sometimes there are people who don‚Äôt want to join again. So I wanted to see if there's an option to move them to a channel called 'lobby'
Answer: -d lobbychannel set


Question: yes that should work
Answer: So I tried doing "/set mmr 1000 @.everyone", and the mmr only gets changed for people who have already entered the queue before. 

Those who haven't entered the queue don't show up anywhere and the "/set mmr 1000 @.everyone" does not seem to affect them as it's like they don't exist in the queue. 

Is there a way to add every single member of a server to be at a certain mmr, even if they have never entered the queue before so that they all show up on the leaderboard or at least exist in the system?

Is there a way to add every single member of a server to be at a certain mmr, even if they have never entered the queue before so that they all show up on the leaderboard or at least exist in the system?
Answer: this should work if i recall


Question: If they havent even clicked "join" in the queue, they are not in neatqueue's data yet
Answer: the problem is they've kept their autorole from before the reset, and now i cant refresh it to represent post-reset values. my only current solution is deleting every single role manually so they dont have the old rank


Question: either way i think the autorole logic should account for people with reset MMR so they lose their role
Answer: that is what I was expecting it to do, but we made the mistake of doing "/managestats reset all" after doing "/managestats reset mmr" in order to erase the win/loss count on the leaderboard, so i believe that wiped every player off the leaderboard/queue system


Question: this should work if i recall
Answer: Ah yeah it does, i thought it only would work on "registered" players


Question: Does that break the monthly players? Like, if only 100 people only clicked join queue, and theres 300 people that didnt click, if i do /set mmr to everyone, everyone would count as an active player and immediately fill the monthly players?
Answer: nah because it only counts players who actually play a match, not based on queuing anymore


Question: should i try to give a certain role to every member in the server and try the /set mmr 1000 @.role to see if that registers them (i believe thats the term you guys use)
Answer: did it not work with everyone?


Question: did it not work with everyone?
Answer: it only worked for those who were already on the leaderboard, it didn't add people who haven't queued since the reset


Question: By default you need at least one game to show
Answer: yeah i believe thats the source of my problem, is there a way to make that 0 games

Question: how do i make it so that when a queue start, a seperate channel for that queue is made

Question: <@857633321064595466> perms
Answer: > ### Why am I getting a permissions error?
> There is various reasons that can raise this error, please make sure to check the following points to solve it:
> - The bot has the necessary permissions.
>   - The bot can send messages and manage channels.
> - If you assign a role to the bot, ensure it doesn't overwrite the bot's permissions.
> - Category and channel permissions do not override the bot's permissions.
>   - If the category or channel is private, add the bot to it through the settings.
> **Fast fix:** Give the bot administrator permissions.

Question: Hi, doing API posts, is it possible to set all players MMRs in one post? For example, I'm using `/api/v2/set/mmr`

```
{
  "channel_id": 123,
  "mmr": 1500,
  "user_id": 3524253425345
}
```

Instead of doing it one at a time, would become something like:

```
[
    {
    "channel_id": 123,
    "mmr": 1500,
    "user_id": 3524253425345
    },
    {
    "channel_id": 123,
    "mmr": 1500,
    "user_id": 3524253425345
    }
]
```

I have already tried this by wrapping it in a array, but it errors
Answer: Unfortunately no, all of these APIs are auto generated and take the same form as the commands


Question: if have existing queues then you should use /link
Answer: i really apperciate ur help!

Question: good morning, I would like to ask a question? can I use two queues and have a single ranking? that calculates both queues but with only one coasification?
Answer: To have a single ranking that calculates both queues but with only one classification, you can use the /leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide toggle:Enabled command to link all queues to one leaderboard. This will allow you to have a unified ranking system across multiple queues. However, please note that you won't be able to combine two different MMR systems together, so it's either separate MMR/leaderboards for separate queues or all in one. If you need further assistance or have more questions, feel free to ask in the ‚Å†‚îÇsupport channel for more help.

Question: <@857633321064595466> stats
Answer: > ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.

Question: + HOW I can make spectator join any game but cant talk
Answer: <@648635725964902411>


Question: How can i implement this? Is there a command?

To have a player lose MMR/ELO if they do not ready up in time, you can consider implementing a system where players who do not join the voice channel within a specified time frame are penalized with a deduction in MMR/ELO. This can help discourage players from delaying the queue process and ensure a smoother experience for all participants. Additionally, you may want to explore setting up a command or feature that automatically deducts MMR/ELO from players who consistently fail to ready up in time. If you need further assistance or guidance on how to implement this feature, I recommend reaching out in the <#868549627652214794> channel for more detailed support.

Hello NeatZ I have 4 questions:

1. How do players use /substitute because they always fail to interact even when someone wants to accept their substitute request?
2. Is there a feature in which a certain match can Double Down their MMR gains and losses for that one game?
3. Is there any way a player can select two roles and get assigned to one of the role to fill the queue?
4. Is there any way to let the player know if they are in queue or in line for an anonymous queue setup?

2) Not automatically, but you can change the /mmr change on demand
3) Unfortunately not

Question: How do I get it to 

#1 - Stop auto making a Queue? For example match starts Queue #9 another starts Queue #10 - is there a way to disable the auto Queue names? 

#2 - How do you under match info change - Queue: player_stats to Queue: Call of Duty 2?

#3 How do you get rid of the timestamp at the bottom?
Answer: 1) not sure what you mean, a queue starts when it fills up


Question: <@857633321064595466> stats
Answer: > ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
