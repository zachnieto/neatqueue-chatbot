Question: <@!297040314898841601> Currently you can see the number of games played by checking your wins and losses, both which are shown in /stats
Ill add a 'Games' leaderboard since I think that would be nice to see
Answer: Yeah, I was just not sure to use the mmr system right now, Not sure if people will vote that they lost and might troll, or maybe I didn't really understand the system

Answer: So yes I guess it would be nice indeed üëç


Question: we have had an instance of 6v6 that didnt start even though every players were picked
Answer: did you by chance change the queue name after some people had queued?


Question: Got a question also about the total games count, if people votes disable mmr, will it count as a game played ? I would have eventually just disable this mmr vote and only make a count game indicator with the /leaderboard.
Answer: currently no stats count, but i think changing to just not count mmr is better


Question: did you by chance change the queue name after some people had queued?
Answer: Yeah I think it was the case


Question: currently no stats count, but i think changing to just not count mmr is better
Answer: Yeah if I asked for that, it's because atm, i'm doing a level system with numbers of game played, but sometimes people don't vote for the enable/disable mmr so game doesn't count.


Question: Yeah if I asked for that, it's because atm, i'm doing a level system with numbers of game played, but sometimes people don't vote for the enable/disable mmr so game doesn't count.

Answer: not currently, you can make mmr requirements for the queue but that requires you to manually set MMR at the beginning. Best advice would be to lock the channels by role

Question: <@!145305657237700608> would it be possible for you to open up the stats api a bit and let's say have option to plug stats to 3rd party database :D
Answer: im down for that, bot doesnt even have any stats api yet but that would be sick


Question: <@!145305657237700608> Hey, was wondering, so, how I have it setup, is there is a Que chat, where people can join que, a Chat that is linked to Que chat where people can do the commands, and I have a waiting room call, that people has to be in. now, when que is full, I have it to auto set teams, does it auto make a call, and drag them into it, or what does it do, since I would like to know how it works before I announce it.
Answer: When the queue fills, it will create a voice channel and prompt everyone to join. If you have a /defaultchannel itll drag players from there. Once everyone joins, it will create 2 Team channels and automatically move players to their respective channels

Question: So I renamed the queue and then updated it and didnt realize it would clear the MMR. Is there a way to retrieve the old leaderboard and update the new one or is it just a lost cause?
Answer: all stats are tied to the queue name, so if you change the name back with /queuename you will get the stats back too


Question: Is there anyway to make it to where the bot automatically selects a random map from the map pool for the players to play and the players don't have to vote on random?
Answer: currently it is only via selection

Answer: all stats are tied to the queue name, so winning in either queue (if they have the same name) will update their overall stats


Question: can we setup MMR to not lose points for those who'll lose but only add points for winners ?
Answer: it‚Äôs a two way street for the most part since the winners gain the mmr that the loser lose


Question: When I make a queue using "/setup?" can that queue with those settings be called upon at any moment or do I have to customize a queue every time I make one?
Answer: this is a common confusion, but once you create a queue it will never go away

Question: I've a got another issue with this screenshot to show you this => i've setup 0 starting MMR for 2 discord roles but when i check my stats i've 1000 whatever i did and i've the Kotsu role on the screenshot
Answer: remove the everyone starting role


Question: Hey, MMR will be for users or can we setup it for discord roles like for exemples 3 discord roles which each one represents 1 village ?

Another question : if 2 discord roles are set with starting MMR at 0 points on a queue, and for the first game between two teams, when one of them lose, the winner will win points with MMR change even if each discord role had 0 points to begin ?
Answer: mmr is per person, not per role. While the starting mmr might be the same, that is all


Question: how to remove it ?
Answer: ./startingmmr


Question: ok it works ty ^^ but MMr per person cannot be replaced per roles then ?
Answer: nah there is no way to have stats shared between players

Question: I know this might sound dumb. But how do I start/complete a game with the Bot? 
Im currently testing it on a server (i disabled the voice channel part) and turned on the Test mode. So when i fill the queue it will create a chanel as it should and pings the players. Does this count as game "started" then? And if yes, how do i end the game to enter the score? and if not, how do normal players without admin commands start a game? the bot seems lovely and id love to use it but i kind of am stuck with this basic question haha

Answer: <@145305657237700608> this suggestion hasn't been planned yet ?


Question: everyone goes to the same place
Answer: Would it be possible in the future to set something like, dropping the players back to where they got picked from and be able to set multiple default channels? Or get players from multiple channels and drop back to  one channel after that?


Question: technically its possible to just grab the required players from all voice channels
Answer: yea, the problem for us is that people q and if the q takes longer they start playing or chatting, etc.  and some other people q and join the same voice channel (default channel) and it starts to get noisy and messy with everyone talking and doing something different at the same time if you know what i mean, so it would be a great solution for us if you consider it as a suggestion

Question: Hi <@145305657237700608> whats the point for /mmrvariance command ?
Answer: This is mainly to minimize the loss/gain when you should win/lose because by default it's at 800 :
- increase that number to minimize the loss/gain 
- reduce that number to increase the loss/gain


Question: if you kept it at default (50) then in the first case the 1000mmr player will win less than 50 mmr so 35 but if you increase the variance it could be 30 instead, in the second case with a basic variance we can say he'll lose 65 but if you increase the variance he'll lose 60 (this is not the math, just pure explanation) variance increased minimize the number of points that are affected by the fact "he should win/lose"
Answer: at default its 50 or 800 ? lol

Question: Hello once more,
 
Is there an option to allow Captains to choose what maps to ban, versus simply allowing the entire lobby to vote on a map? Typically in R6 10Mans servers, each team captain (after teams have been formed/picked) will ban a map from the pool until 1 remains. Something along this format

- Captain 1 and Captain 2's teams are formed
- System randomly assigns Captain 1 the option to ban a map first, from the 7 available [A, B, C, D, E, F, G]
- Captain 1 bans A:
- Captain 2 bans B:
- Captain 1 bans C:
- Captain 2 bans D:
- Captain 1 bans E:
- Captain 2 bans F:
- **G is decider**

In most R6 systems as well, they allow the Captain who __did not__ ban the last map to also pick which side they want, whether that be Defend first or Attack first.
Thus, in this scenario:
----
...
- Captain 2 bans F:
- **G is decider**
- Captain 1 picks DEF, Captain 2 is left with ATK
Answer: there is currently no map ban system

Question: Hey there!

I have a quick question regarding the queue bot. I have been running it on my server for a while and wanted to configure it properly for once, so I went through every command there is.

Now I'm in a state where a queue can have 10/10 players, but the bot doesn't react, it neither pings all players, nor sets up a new queue, nor shuffles teams for me. On a second server of mine, it works perfectly fine. 

Does anybody know which command I used to blow everything up? If not, is there a way to reset the bot to default settings? Kicking the bot and re-adding it to the server does not work. Could this entire thing be permission related?
Answer: try it again real quick?

Answer: All we need is a system that allows our audience to play the game with fairly fun and equal lobbies. We are strictly against a way for players to compete for imaginary points, but want to make use of the benefits of fairly balanced teams üòÑ

Question: Right now with my 

Variance value - 5000
MMR change - 50 this is what is happening.

Highest MMR player is gaining the most  and lowest MMR player is losing the Most.
Answer: so with a variance value of 5000, basically everyone will gain right around 50 MMR


Question: So im trying to make it like this, The higher MMR players who win gain less  than the lower MMR players that win.

On the losing team, the higher MMR player loses more than the lower MMR player. Im trying to set it up like this but cant get the right number figures set up to do so.
Answer: looks like you want `/mmrchange mmr:100 loser_mmr:50 variance:10000`


Question: huh

Question: Is there a way to have 4 roles and have 1 player on each team, to make 1 versus 1?
Answer: not sure what u mean here tho


Question: <@145305657237700608> Is the status button working?
Answer: fixed


Question: not sure what u mean here tho
Answer: Having 1 versus 1, for example I choose 4 roles, and my enemy chooses to play with one of the four roles too,
1x1


Question: if its a 1v1, why do you need roles?
Answer: For me to choose a role to play, now if I put 4 roles and I put /teamsize 1, the bot puts only one role, in One vs One, it's nice to have the option to choose which role I want to take, to face my enemy


Question: doesnt matter what role you would choose, roles are only used in creating teams
Answer: in the past you could choose a role, there was a sniper/support/assassin/, I chose a sniper and my sniper friend too, now if I choose a role for the heroes, only 1 role appears and no other option, that is, I have to create 3 different channels , for a One vs One with each role different?


Question: the bot doesnt do anything with that information in a 1v1
Answer: So I should let you know in the lobby text channel, which role am I going to play?


Question: im not sure what u mean really, i havent changed anything like that
Answer: I tried with the command /forcestart, to start when each team has a player, but it still didn't work :( , I don't understand what happened


Question: i have no clue what will happen but maybe it‚Äôs what u did
Answer: It worked, thank you angel Neatz

Answer: is this something that needs to be added possibly? or is the `/map selction: Random`  bugged?


Question: so you want to give people those roles? or you want the teams to be balanced via those roles
Answer: I gave them an evuivilant MMR rating, I want 8 people 2 queue up for a 4v4, then once the captains are settled and the teams are picked I want it to show the overall score and show the odds of each team winning I thought I saw that


Question: and if I keep making changes with /save? it just keep adding on to updates I am making? Also for the captains... does it randomly select one out of the two? or is there an order <@145305657237700608>
Answer: for any captain selection mode, the lowest mmr player picks first if that‚Äôs what you mean?


Question: for any captain selection mode, the lowest mmr player picks first if that‚Äôs what you mean?
Answer: got it just making sure. and the picks are always 1-1-1-1?


Question: that depends on the /captains drafttype
Answer: okay cool, and depending on the pool can we change the draft type once the pool hits 8/8 ?


Question: okay cool, and depending on the pool can we change the draft type once the pool hits 8/8 ?
Answer: no not really, draft type is always the same, there is no vote for that


Question: last question after a team is picked and the game starts it looks like it loads up another queue, can we stop that from happening, so somebody would need to do /load #### again?
Answer: also no, the main point of NeatQueue is that queues are always running and don‚Äôt need any admin intervention


Question: with /tempchannels it will create a new text channel once the queue is filled for the team setup if that‚Äôs what you mean
Answer: this is amazing insight


Question: yup with /startingmmr
Answer: Okay, I tried to assign all of the roles to a specific mmr, but it seemed like every role was just the highest one


Question: also if you already have entered the queue, you wont get a new starting mmr
Answer: then how do multiple people from different roles join, giving the lowers mmr the first pick?

Answer: soembody with an "unranked" role joins and gets S tier... I just need to assign  starting mmr to it, but I dont know that everything should just get a basic starting mmr because they are "unranked" so wondering if they can get a starting mmr depending on who they beat or lose to

Will they automatically be placed in voice chats I have created or will they need to decide which one to go into?             2. Once a game is completed, how does the reporting work to reflect elo? Will I or a mod need to monitor this at all times and manually report?
Answer: hi!

1. (Default settings) When the queue fills up, a temporary voice channel is created so all players must join to ready up. From here, team selection will begin. After teams are created, players are automatically moved to their team channels
2. After teams are finalized, a message appears in the channel with buttons to vote for the winning team. Players should vote after the match finished. By default this is a majority vote, so you don't need a mod to monitor the results


Question: yup, `/map bans` lol

Question: <@145305657237700608> hey, we disabled voting for result as people were lying or voting before the game is done, but moderating it would be too much, but problem is, it also stops admins from receiving the vote for result to override there results, which is really annoying lol

Question: Hey, so I'm trying to run a tournament in my server, I have a few other queues that I run in there and I've unified their leaderboards using the /queuename or /rename (the documentation for those 2 commands are misleading, I accidentally deleted everyones stats like 3 times lol). Anyways, when I try to do the same method for the Tournament queue it's picking up what looks like everyone's stats in the main leaderboard from a long time ago or something. Is this a feature that doesn't work yet or am I doing something wrong?
Answer: The stats come from the queue name, so if the tournament is named something an old queue was named, the stats will appear


Question: also /rename and /queuename do the same thing? I thought one of the commands was supposed to just rename it but keep stats?
Answer: /queuename just changes the name which in turn gives different stats, /rename changes the name and keeps stats


Question: /queuename just changes the name which in turn gives different stats, /rename changes the name and keeps stats
Answer: Oh ok I think I‚Äôm just confused cause I didn‚Äôt realize you‚Äôre using the queue name as an index in your db (or I‚Äôm assuming I know nothing of the architecture of the bot) thanks for the response, I checked server stats and i realized that it was just a bug because for some reason there was a date prefixed to the queue name in the queue list and that was the actual name, /info was showing me the name I thought it was the whole time. Just a heads up


Question: Yo one of the players in my discord for some reason cant see the temp VOICE rooms the bot opens he can join the queue its moving him to team rooms but only after one of the staff moves him in the qeue room do you have any idea how to fix it?
Answer: unless they have some weird permissions issue i would imagine update/restart the client


Question: Oh ok I think I‚Äôm just confused cause I didn‚Äôt realize you‚Äôre using the queue name as an index in your db (or I‚Äôm assuming I know nothing of the architecture of the bot) thanks for the response, I checked server stats and i realized that it was just a bug because for some reason there was a date prefixed to the queue name in the queue list and that was the actual name, /info was showing me the name I thought it was the whole time. Just a heads up
Answer: yea the queue name is where the stats are stored, it‚Äôs a bit weirder if you use Monthly stats enabled cuz behind the scenes the queue name is just prefixed with the month and year


Question: unless they have some weird permissions issue i would imagine update/restart the client
Answer: wdym client like tell them to restart the discord?


Question: its not popping up for me, we chose the teams then want to ban maps but nothing pops up is there a certain commands to start map bans?
Answer: no as long as you added maps it should appear


Question: unfortunately not, currently autoroles only behaves with the strict cutoff
Answer: figured as much. I thought of having multiple Qs for each rank (and thus different role thresholds), but I don't see a way to "move" the MMR to your new rank Q when you rank up/down


Question: would be interested in adding that though
Answer: well it would certainly be a cool feature to have imo, always thought that addition by RL was pretty cool üòÑ


Question: unfortunately not, currently autoroles only behaves with the strict cutoff
Answer: What does the lower rating and upper rating function do?


Question: hey i made a role and made him spectator role but for somereason everytime they join the channel they get automuted is there a way to fix it?

Answer: I want to switch it the other way


Question: is there a way to plot the skill distribution of a number of players (with skill distributed normally) after a certain number of games? (say 1000)
Answer: no not really, best advice would be to use the calculator (which may or may not be in the docs)


Question: also no, not using true skill at all
Answer: may I ask what then? fairly curious üòÑ (but if it's proprietary dw obviously!)


Question: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ue5labtkpv
Answer: ohhh thanks! I've looked for it in the docs but couldn't find it :S


Question: i could simulate it, not home unfortunately and won‚Äôt be for a few days
Answer: I think it would be cool to have a tool to simulate the distribution (it should be fairly easy with hosting on huggingface spaces or something like that)

Answer: no not really, discord limits channel name updates to 2 per 10 minutes, so it‚Äôs kinda too slow to be useful

Question: Regarding the lower_lose_rating feature, I have a question: if I have Rank A at 1400-1499 and lose at 1350, and Rank B at 1300-1399 with lose at 1250, and a player lands between 1350 and 1400, they're gonna have both roles. Is this intended?
Answer: hmmm yea i guess that makes sense, no that probably shouldnt work like that


Question: hmmm yea i guess that makes sense, no that probably shouldnt work like that
Answer: alright, I'll wait for an update then, ty!


Question: not too sure how to approach that fix, since autoroles usually dont need to look at the other autoroles
Answer: yeah, without looking at other autoroles I guess it's not possible. 
I'd have approached it with a simple condition "assign it only if no other autorole [in the lower-lower_lose bound] is currently assigned", but ye, you need to access other autoroles with their info (for the more detailed condition) or at least the list of roles handled by autoroles (which is easier I guess, just a set instead of a map/dict)


Question: probably just default that to True anyways
Answer: what are you referring to here?


Question: is there a command to see a summary of the options / config of a Q?
Answer: /info


Question: easier fix: at demotion players stuck at the rank's minimum mmr (no lose points) but after losing another x number of matches on that minimum, set mmr to soft threshold points
Answer: nah thats not as easy, but i also think players MMR should still work the same regardless of the autoroles setup


Question: i'm trying to do a 1v1 queue with map bans and picks, but after the bans i wanted each player to vote for a map alone,  but instead they are voting together. is there a way that i can do that?
Answer: unfortunately map votes are everyone at once. Why would you want them to vote seperately?


Question: i wanted the same along with the queue menu and leaderboards menu to be individual and not being a public post - unfortunately, its not implemented and probably takes some time and energy if  NeatZ able do that
Answer: private leaderboard command option is easy to add, what was the queue menu thing?


Question: unfortunately map votes are everyone at once. Why would you want them to vote seperately?
Answer: because i wanted to do how usually works, each team banning and picking maps one at a time


Question: gotcha, the current map ban system does all the bans first, then the map pick
Answer: yeah i know, but would be nice if was possible to do the maps picks one at a time


Question: nah thats not as easy, but i also think players MMR should still work the same regardless of the autoroles setup
Answer: i didnt seen it action yet, but i hope so


Question: private leaderboard command option is easy to add, what was the queue menu thing?
Answer: the indicator that the matchmaking has (0/2, 1/2, etc.) discourages players to actually try to join the queue, if there is no one to play with, then usually no one is get it the queue just alone - queue menu should be private, so everyone would just see its own version and not indicate queue number status at public/to the players just a message that they are in or out - its a huge setback of getting games


Question: nah thats not as easy, but i also think players MMR should still work the same regardless of the autoroles setup

Answer: gotcha, i can remove the queue size indicator, the only thing I can do with the private message to show if you are in the queue or not is one of those personal messages that you can click to delete

Answer: What do you think the queue message should show for Matchmaking?


Question: This is my current settings for queue
What i need:
1)No players pick,captains are the highest mmr players,teams balanced by mmr
2)Map veto for bo1
3)When match is created, i need bot to create temp voice channels for teams
4) All players start with 1000mmr, +30 for win, -30 for loss, for winstreak need to add additional +15mmr
Answer: 1) If you want teams to just be balanced by MMR, change the `/teamselection`
2) You can enable map bans with `/map bans`
3) This is already enabled, `/voicechannels`
4) Your starting MMR and MMR changes are already set, but you cant change the winstreak multiplier


Question: 1) If you want teams to just be balanced by MMR, change the `/teamselection`
2) You can enable map bans with `/map bans`
3) This is already enabled, `/voicechannels`
4) Your starting MMR and MMR changes are already set, but you cant change the winstreak multiplier
Answer: if i enable map bans, team captains will do veto?


Question: i think only the captains should vote for the maps, would be cool to have an option to this

Question: it will ping all the players though
Answer: Players often mute server, so they don't see pings üò¶


Question: Players often mute server, so they don't see pings üò¶
Answer: I do think DMins players with their respective lobbies is better than just pinging the main setup channel (I thought it was an option at first but dont know what DM option was at the end)


Question: is there a way to add automatic created voice chats by the bot to another already created category?, example: Queue setup is in X category, but i dont want the voice chats to be created on this X category, I want them in Y category that is already created with other permissions
Answer: not currently, `/channel category` exists, but it doesn't let you specify a different category, that could be added though


Question: I do think DMins players with their respective lobbies is better than just pinging the main setup channel (I thought it was an option at first but dont know what DM option was at the end)
Answer: the DM thing you are thinking about is probably respective to lobby details, like giving the lobby password etc


Question: not currently, `/channel category` exists, but it doesn't let you specify a different category, that could be added though
Answer: for this would be nice to add /channel category: ID + channel copy: ID (So they copy permissions from an already setup channel?)


Question: shouldnt need to mess with any permissions stuff for the created channels
Answer: But I would like to mess with permissions <a:saddies:1036160477039951923>


Question: nope, all the leaderboard controls are locked to you
Answer: But if they click on the link, they will see actual standings on site?


Question: give me an example lol
Answer: lets say I have a category created with the Default channel that I want the new ones to be created like, example: this Default channel has permissions for Spectating role + Coach role, people with spectating role can watch but not talk, coach role can watch and talk, is not necessary for this users to join the Queue in order to participate in the voice channel (sometimes teams would have a coach, some other teams would prefer to not have one) and you can do whatever other roles people might need if you can clone permissions


Question: Or maybe there is the way just to lock leaderboard
So players can refresh it, but can't change anything more
Answer: I guess option to remove different filters from leaderboard would be useful


Question: have you checked out `/spectatorrole` ?
Answer: ye, maybe there can be like a few of those? like /spectatorrole /spectator2role /spectator3role or something like that to give specific permissions to different user tiers


Question: for players that have played matches in different servers, then play matches in a new server with the same bot, how do u stop old players mmr from transfering over to the new server?
Answer: stats are not shared between servers unless you use global queues


Question: neat queue says its not part of global queue
Answer: you are good then


Question: does anyone know how to disable these options?
Answer: /teamselection


Question: 
Answer: perhaps you had different settings loaded when they queued for the first time, so they got a different starting mmr


Question: and how about these buttons how can i change them?
Answer: team names?


Question: Hello, hope u all are going great! I've been trying to create a party but this message pops out
Answer: what did you name the party?


Question: nah, map selection happens after map bans
Answer: yes i meant is it possible for captains to select one at a time


Question: yes, what was the party name you tried, it broke on the name
Answer: It was called Duo


Question: yes you can make it only captains voting <#910981294937210930>
Answer: but after the bans, they are still voting together, i wanna to make them vote separately for 1 map each


Question: It was called Duo
Answer: oh i see


Question: but after the bans, they are still voting together, i wanna to make them vote separately for 1 map each
Answer: yea  you cant do that currently, thatll have to be added


Question: oh i see

Answer: yeah i wanted to do they ban 2 maps each and then select 1 map each


Question: fixed
Answer: Thank you

Question: When I try to join queue it gives me the "The game just started, please wait for the current queue to finish creation!" message even after the game is finished and the only way to fix it is to /clearqueue or have one of the players leave the queue first to update it
Answer: thats strange, could you /save and paste the config code here? My first guess would be some kind of permissions error is ocurring


Question: Heyya, during the setup I think I accidently set the starting mmr on default, while I want new players to start at 0

Question: Hey NeatZ! I'm a dev working with Kotri and tarik on the Pro 10 mans. Going to probably have a variety of questions, but I was wondering if you'd be willing to allow me to contribute source to the bot/API. 

Would help us implement features we'd like without overloading you, and would help the bot get more features in general.
Answer: Hey! I guess it depends on the scope of what features, im usually inclined to say no since I've been able to everything solo so far


Question: kk sounds good
Answer: try now


Question: I blame Discord

Question: If I'm getting this right - this bot isn't tuned for any game specifically, but rather a "party maker"?
Answer: it‚Äôs designed in a way so you can adjust the settings to work for any game


Question: Also, how does mmr work? Is it simply win = + set amount of mmr and loss = - set amount of mrr, maybe with small deviations? are the mmr loss and gain amounts actually based on performance, or just win/loss?

Question: is there a way to remove people from leaderboard if they left the discord server
Answer: you should be able to reset their stats


Question: you‚Äôll need their id though for /resetstats player
Answer: ye the thing is i don't have it


Question: for the setting that puts people back into a channel after a game is done, I think the channel is getting deleted before it pulls everyone so not everyone makes it
Answer: that kinda makes sense, at some point i changed it so this actions happened asynchronous


Question: If I organise a tourney, is there a way to add the queue function where teams who play against each other have to go through map selection process, same thing like they do in the queues?
Answer: yea, a tournament starting really just starts a queue behind the scenes, you so you can customize how matches play out like normal


Question: tried to sub someone in and it booted him
Answer: other methods of adding players to queue skips most of the checks, i‚Äôll be sure to make it so that no matter how you join it hits all checks


Question: sorry if this is asked a lot but how do i make another queue that is connected to an existing one so that it shares the same leaderboard stats?
Answer: if two queues have the same name, they will share stats


Question: Hello, may I know if I can merge two leaderboard together if there is 2 sperate queue?
Answer: you can, if a Queue has the same name as another, the leaderboards will be shared


Question: The leaderboard seems to be having some trouble on tarik's public discord. The image is correct but the website is wrong, is it possible it's caching a previous score and not updating ?
Answer: it should be caching for 30 seconds


Question: imagine you played with a certain name for 2 months, then enable monthly stats, you would want those 2 months of stats to be in the all time stats

Question: Documentation? https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/
Answer: ey sry my mistake


Question: This is a weird request, is it possible currently to have anyone currently in a match get a Role in Discord?
Answer: well anyways, yes


Question: NeatZ... what are the chances you'd be able to make a somewhat completely unrelated endpoint just for our server that'll get all the Discord users that are currently "Streaming" (aka live on Twitch, based on their Discord activity), and return the list of their Twitch users üëÄ
Answer: sure that‚Äôs easy at least with the integration i think


Question: Yeah I can do that, so no pressure. Just was trying to avoid spinning up my own bot. Mostly just laziness üòõ
Answer: up to you, gonna update this morning, so lmk


Question: what happens when u try
Answer: It says authorization complete but not actually showing that it is authorized for the server


Question: Go for it if you can üôÇ
Answer: what kind of return val do you want


Question: Then I feel less guilty about this feature request üòÑ
Answer: üòÖ bad news, neatqueue does not have the required Discord intents to view activities, so you are gonna need your own bot


Question: lol im very paranoid about member permissions because there's often bots that join and try to DM anyone that they can see. I have it so verified members aren't affected and don't show up for the bots. But if people are in the neatq then they could get spammed with phishing dms
Answer: this should be fixed


Question: what issue are u having?
Answer: We are having issues within our server as the bot is muting people entering the queue and allowing players to move between voice channels. And we didn`t put anything in the bot, some issues start after the bought of the premium version of the bot


Question: there was a change today that made created voice channels obey the permissions set by your category
Answer: probably this^


Question: <@773200669032841247> the bot is missing perms
Answer: Can you see if it's fixed now?


Question: For some reason when the match ends it deletes the Text channel but keeps the voice channel open
Answer: this is strange though, i would say permission issue but probably not


Question: if you are using matchmaking, you wouldnt really want it
Answer: but what if im doing PUGS?


Question: the generated vcs have their own perms
Answer: sorry, this change had to be reverted temporarily


Question: but what if im doing PUGS?
Answer: no, its pretty useful for pugs cuz you can create multiple tiers of queues


Question: but if its all for the same rating?
Answer: then no point


Question: My mmr wont show everyone else in the servers show but mine doesnt work. Im the owner
Answer: unfortunately bots are unable to nickname the server owner

Text Channels:
    - inherit perms for category
    - @ everyone has view_channel perms denied

Answer: All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!

Answer: yes same thing, you can use the queue name to seed the bracket based on current MMRs


Question: try /clearqueue ?
Answer: maybe i'm thinking about this the wrong way. i created a new category and new channel `register` and sent the `/tournament create ...` command in that channel. I did `/clearqueue` in that same channel and says it was cleared, but no buttons still.

For me I want it to be separate from my other queues and have the tournament on a separate leaderboard.

Question: what do the voice channel perms look like
Answer: People with a certain role can see and text/speak in the voice channels


Question: nope, that voice channel is still locked
Answer: That's why I'm saying enabled and disabled restrictions looks the same atm


Question: nope, that voice channel is still locked
Answer: you have something else blocking it then


Question: otherwise the best way would be just being able to manage the voice channels restrictions by ourselves if there's a way
Answer: that is why its copying from the category now


Question: you were relying on the fact that the bot didnt care before, but your perms were not correctly set
Answer: Breh Nice, Blame it on me


Question: it does change things though, for example, previously, you were unable to hide the voice channels completely for the @ everyone role since by default the bot did not touch that when creating voice channels
Answer: yesterday, with restriction on, voice channels were invisible for @everyone..


Question: Now as you say the bot follows the permissions of the category, but following these permissions allows all those who have the role dedicated to that queue to join the voice channels, because they are no longer private for players who have joined the queue and are not they have the entry limit as they had yesterday.
A solution could be that the bot creates the voice channels with the input limit equal to the team size set in the queue.
Answer: you should be able to remove the permission that lets the role join the voice channel, no?


Question: you should be able to remove the permission that lets the role join the voice channel, no? ---> if i remove the permission people cant join at the first voice queue channel that the bot create for start the queue.
also the created voice channels will have a limit matching the number of players --> Today he creates them without limits
Answer: the first voice channel explicitly gives all players connect permissions though


Question: no, if you have a staff role added, there will never be a channel limit
Answer: ^^^^^^^^^


Question: yes that is the default behavior
Answer: that isn't locking


Question: wdym

Question: 1)
Answer: dont get it


Question: 2) have you updated the perms?
Answer: what perms do i need to update specifically>


Question: dont get it
Answer: since you have a staff role added, the bot does not add a user limit to channels


Question: what perms do i need to update specifically>
Answer: connect


Question: since you have a staff role added, the bot does not add a user limit to channels
Answer: Then how should we have mods that moderate those queues if no one has that staffrole?


Question: connect
Answer: i can disable connect? will the players in queue be able to connect?


Question: cuz how would the staff member join
Answer: staff should over ride right?


Question: staff should over ride right?

Question: yo
Answer: I think i have it figured out, I added a new voting menu and I want basically all players to vote on it, but only be able to vote once and not be able to change their vote. My team selection is based on captain picks.

This is how I created the voting menu:
`/votingmenu add title:Allow Snipers options:Yes,No key:Allow Snipers team_voting:All Teams show_numbers:True number_of_votes:1 eligible_voters:All`

Answer: on the docs there is a calculator link, search for desmos


Question: on the docs there is a calculator link, search for desmos
Answer: Ik I saw it, i still don‚Äôt understand how the variance effects the mmr tbh


Question: its rocket science man
Answer: I swear man


Question: as the variance value increases, it decreases the output MMR variance
Answer: So would you generally recommend to have higher settings or lower than default?


Question: do people still fit the criteria then?
Answer: they do, im just going through carlbot and taking roles away from humans


Question: but the calculator shows pretty well wht changing the value does
Answer: Im gonna be honest, the calculator confuses me a ton


Question: raise the variance value to 2400, and they would gain 47.6 instead

Answer: that is correct


Question: you can modify the view channel permissions for the category then
Answer: can you tell me how to do it? Im kinda noob in discord


Question: Thanks, I understand its pretty niche compared to what‚Äôs available now, but what if the Matchmaking queue could start a match when the queue is X amount of players? (X being a number above 1 lobby size, obviously) /numberoflobbies is great as is, especially for smaller lobbies like 1v1, but I‚Äôd rather have an option to wait for extra people to come and have the bot put them in if its better for balance, instead of waiting for an amount of players _double_ the size of one lobby. I understand its very niche, since Matchmaking already waits for a set MMR range that widens over time, but It would eliminate a situation where the bot starts the game anyway because its taken too long
Answer: i would say that seems pretty unnecessary, the new matchmaking system does basically the same thing, you can just config the settings the better match what you want

Question: trying to figure this out myself atm and saw that if you reset someones stats it doesnt show up as an actual message, but as one only the person executing the command can see.

What could be the problem?
Answer: check your /info


Question: next match, and again 2 new players got wrong starting mmr

Question: Hey there, I've got one of the leaderboards showing the months on top left of the site, while the other 2 leaderboards don't show it and just show the all-time rankings (while I decide when to reset). Is there a way to make it show all-time only and remove the monthly rankings without resetting the actual leaderboards? Or at least having "All Time" to be selected right when you open the rankings page?
Answer: what URL is this in reference to?

Question: Hey I was also wondering, is there a way to have different queues, but every higher queue starts from a higher mmr? 
I mean, let's put for example that I have Rank A, Rank B and Rank C. I'd like Rank C to start at 500, Rank B at 800, Rank A at 1000 points. So if a player from Rank C reaches 800 points he gets promoted to rank B. (But every Rank can only queue for their rank)
Is it already possible to do that right now?
Answer: you can create different queues, add a `/rolerequirement`, set the starting MMR per role with `/startingmmr`, then use `/autoroles mmr` to let people rank up + down


Question: you can create different queues, add a `/rolerequirement`, set the starting MMR per role with `/startingmmr`, then use `/autoroles mmr` to let people rank up + down
Answer: Just to make sure, does this make higher mmr players to lose more points if they queue in a lower rank and lose? (and at the same time win less points if they win?)


Question: Just to make sure, does this make higher mmr players to lose more points if they queue in a lower rank and lose? (and at the same time win less points if they win?)
Answer: yes, but with the role requirement they can‚Äôt queue in low ranks


Question: yes, but with the role requirement they can‚Äôt queue in low ranks

Question: yes if you name the queues different
Answer: how to setup?


Question: i follow the procedure of setting up the bot but for some reason when i did it myself, whenever people filled the queue, the bot would make the voice channel and text channel for it but never display a prompt for people to join the voice channel and it would be just stuck. any idea why?
Answer: probably missing permissions


Question: Cool, last question I think

If I want the voice channels to be public so spectators can join, but the setup channel to be private so only players can see and type in it, is that possible?
Answer: either set a /spectatorrole, or modify the category permissions

Answer: just /queuename


Question: i follow the procedure of setting up the bot but for some reason when i did it myself, whenever people filled the queue, the bot would make the voice channel and text channel for it but never display a prompt for people to join the voice channel and it would be just stuck. any idea why?

Question: Yeah I have a spectator role, but they can see the text channels and voice channels. I'm wondering if its possible for them to only see voice channels
Answer: not via /spectatorrole, you can do that with modifying category permissions

Answer: if i pay premium, is it 1 time payment?

Answer: you buy credits, and then add 30 days to your premium counter

Question: How does premium work? Or is there a place to read about it? Can't find anything on it
Answer: you can log into the website and give premium to your server


Question: And are the player limitations reset at some point? Or like once we reach 500 players on the leaderboard no new players can join
Answer: once 500 unique people queue, the next player will be blocked from queuing


Question: I know premium is 1000 players but what is the daily games increase and queue increase to
Answer: 250 games, 10 queues


Question: 250 games, 10 queues
Answer: Couple more questions on this, I know I'll very likely need to purchase premium so want to make sure I understand everything

- Are these restrictions queue based or server based? So each queue can have 50 games a day etc
- Does ./resetstats all reset these limitations? Specifically the max player limit, since it resets the leaderboard

And last thing is there a command for completely deleting a queue? I have a couple test queues that I no longer need

Question: you can create different queues, add a `/rolerequirement`, set the starting MMR per role with `/startingmmr`, then use `/autoroles mmr` to let people rank up + down
Answer: Hey there I was trying what you said, but I just thought something. If I do like you said, I will have the same player having a different MMR between the 2 queues I want them to queue for, right? For example If Rank A is 1500 mmr, after some games in his rank he gets to 1600 mmr, the problem is he will have 1500 mmr (starting mmr) in another queue, right?
So is there a possibility to have that player from Rank A to be able to queue in another queue with his Rank A mmr?

Answer: why not just let them queue in the lower rank?


Question: why not just let them queue in the lower rank?
Answer: i'm doing it, but the fact is they don't play seriously because they can't lose points in their actual rank


Question: how large is the server?
Answer: Currently the server that is using the bot is quite small, just over 100 members. But this is a competitive subcommunity of the much larger Polygon game community, 9000 members in the discord. I manage both of these, and soon once we finish setting up the competitive server, where we have this ranked system and we're also getting a team league going, I'll be announcing the whole thing to the entire community. Currently advertising is just word of mouth. 

I understand why you have these packages for player count + games + queue, it makes sense. But for me it does suck needing to pay for stuff I don't need at all. The likelihood of the community playing more than 250 games in a day is very low, but since the community is large I imagine a lot of different players coming in and playing a game or two then never touching it again. Atleast if I cleared stats it should clear from your database as well to not take up space, thus removing from my player count limit


Question: But then can I make people of their rank to be only able to queue in their queue?
Answer: you can restrict queues with /rolerequirement

Question: When making a queue, how can I set the team sizes for each team to different amounts?
Answer: that is not supported currently


Question: that is not supported currently
Answer: Gotcha. I was honestly just wondering how these people made it this way


Question: I hate to keep asking the same questions, it just feels like I'm asking to be spoon-fed the answers which is basically what's happening right now.

I still can't figure out the sequence to make each role have different amounts. I originally thought it would be the setup or startqueue command, set it to 2 teams of 6 players each, then setting the roles to Field and Goalkeeper. Am I missing something, or do I have the whole sequence wrong?
Answer: it should be like `/roles Goalkeeper,Field,Field,Field,Field,Field`

Question: I have set it up to balance on MMR now and everyone is assigned a ranked role with a different starting MMR to keep it balanced. However in doing this it means the highest rank players are automatically at the top of the leaderboard because they start with so much MMR.  A radiant could have lost 2 games but be ahead of someone that is plat but won 2 games. I was wondering if it‚Äôs possible to view the leaderboard in a way that shows your wins v loss without the mmr? So someone that has won 2 and lost 1 would be above someone that has won 1 lost 1 no matter their mmr/rank
Answer: no, there isnt a way to do that since everything is based around MMR


Question: MMR is the fairest when everyone starts at the same MMR
Answer: I think when everyone is at same rank/skill level definitely. We have Silver players and Semi pros in the same lobbies sometimes

Question: wdym how to set placements if they already played?
Answer: what I mean is that in my queue there are already people with matches played, however, I would like to reset the overall mmr, but leave the number of matches.

3- What's the difference between MMR and Point for this bot?
Answer: 1) `/teamselection`
2) Currently there is no captains only winner voting, its either whatever you have set for `/requiredvotes`, or changed with `/winnermessage results`
3) MMR is the built in elo system, points are a separate thing gained per game and can be used in predictions

Question: Heya! Glanced around at most channels and wasnt able to find a solution so do let me know if i asked around in the wrong spot

Essentially im trying to set up a config with the bot where i can have the following done:

```Player 1 (A) wants to start a game but needs someone to play with
A enters the queue and awaits another Player (B)

Once B selects the second team it automatically pings both of them to essentially say "Hey i've grabbed someone for you to play with"
```

So far ive set it up as seen below, but by disabling the winner vote they dont get pinged about team creation

Id rather not have to set up private channels for the same but my ideal scenario is to just have the channel with the actual queue be empty aside from the bot's initial queue message

(or have the results autocleared)

Is that something that can be done with this bot or did i cause confusion with what i intend to do

Question: if i set the points gained by a win why are people getting different mmr for winning?
Answer: MMR and Points are 2 different things.
The bot's default is 50 MMR and 100 points per win.
MMR won/loss varies slightly depending on the variance setting, which is 1600 by default.
If you want the MMR given to always be exactly 50, you need to enable the "Static" option using "/mmr change set".

Question: I know that what you are doing is not easy and that it is probably not your job, but since problems often derive from updates, changes and improvements that are being made to the bot, I wanted to suggest that you apply these changes only to the bot of those who are not premium, in order to understand if there are bugs, and then implement them also to those who have the premium, perhaps a week later. Unfortunately the continuous problems begin to tire our users.

Question: <@145305657237700608>
Answer: no, the bot only takes in wins/losses


Question: Is there a way to configure it so that only team captains vote on the winner of the match?
Answer: not currently


Question: its not increased odds, its guaranteed priority
Answer: Gotcha, I was kinda hoping it was sort of like a giveaway, those with higher roles just had a few extra chances


Question: you can customize the win/loss base amounts though
Answer: I gotcha! No worries, I know my system is a little wacky. Was basically just wondering if there is any way at all to set random variance to mmr after winning and losing.

Say team 1 lost:
Player 1 may lose 2% of MMR
Player 2 may lose 5% of MMR
Player 3 may lose 3% of MMR
Player 4 may lose 20% of MME

While I know this isn‚Äôt ideal as a default setting, having a little bit of luck involved gives more people a feeling at a chance at top of leaderboard and a chance to catch someone above them even though they may get put on same team together a lot


Question: but i can have the giveaway type system available for later/tomorrow
Answer: Awesome thank you! 
I‚Äôm sure the try hards in my stream will like the 100% skill based, but the randomness helped the less skilled feel like they have a shot some weeks haha


Question: Heck maybe just a wins leaderboard will do the trick rather than a MMR for what I‚Äôm tryin to accomplish
Answer: there is a wins leaderboard available in /leaderboard and the website


Question: there is a wins leaderboard available in /leaderboard and the website
Answer: yeah thats what I was saying, I could just use that instead of focusing on the MMR so much


Question: <@145305657237700608> Any chance to add
1-1-1-2
Drafting option?
Captain 1: Picks
Captain 2: Picks
Captain 1 Picks:
Captain 2: gets picks 6 & 7.
Captain 1 gets last pick.

This prevents captain 1 from getting first pick and not stuck with the overall last pick in lobby.
Answer: ill check it out


Question: <@145305657237700608> how do I make my queues have different leaderboards
Answer: name the queues different


Question: I've looked through the documentation twice and either missed it or am unaware of it's proper name. 
Is there a command to have NeatQueue no longer require players to join VC lobby for the voting to start? 
We plan on creating evens with 64 players and up, having that many join a single VC is impossible, especially in teams of 8 where they plan on sticking inside their Discord server. 
Any help is much appreciated; thank you in advance.

Question: hi, I'm contacting you cause I'm interested in using the neatqueue bot (paying for it long term) for a community discord, I started experimenting on a test server just to see what it looked like in action, I then added it to the main server a few weeks later before realising there was a trial timer that was linked on a per account basis, I'm now stuck with almost no trial left on the actual server I wanna test it on (my mistake) I'm wondering if there would be a way you could generously reset the trial for a specific server, or even my account so I could actually test the bot with my final user in real conditions and decide with the other admins if the bot is well received by our community and if we wanna pay for it, you can DM me if you wanna answer there, thanks by advance !

It was set at startingmmr 0 but I just noticed that now it's set at 1000 mmr. There's no role assigned to this role, so it's set as Everyone - 1000mmr.

Question: How do I stop neatqueue from kicking people for inactivity? I have a queue going for a game in 8 hours and it keeps kicking people from the queue.

Answer: When did the server hit 1K lol ggs


Question: Last night was the saddest night
Answer: why the saddest night


Question: why the saddest night
Answer: Neatq bot down


Question: /timer afk toggle:False
Answer: I did that, and it said the timer would be disabled, but then everyone got kicked out of the queue again... I like to start queues a couple hours ahead of time, then refer to the queue list when it's time for me to stream but Neatqueue has never kept the queue up for people to see.. Anytime the queue fills up, it disappears or it kicks everyone out and starts over again.  I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to be but it has been incredibly frustrating asking everyone in my server to queue up every time the queue resets itself for no reason.

Question: I have one more question.
I would like to create a Matchmaking Queue for each rank and then merge them into one (managed by one Leaderborad).
To separate queues by rank as in this image, do I create a queue for each channel? Or is there a way to share a queue to multiple channels?
Answer: To share stats between multiples queues u need to name them all with the same Queue Name, to separate queues by rank as in the image, u need to create a queue for each channel, and u you will need to update the ```/role requirement``` for each queue

Question: I love the idea of /register, for allocating accurate mmr, but is there where this is *optional*?

Answer: if they are not registered they can¬¥t play?

Question: lemme see
Answer: i have 0 mmr, enabled requireregister with valorant, and even if i dont reg it lets me play, is it bypassing it? or am i doing something wrong


Question: But it does look like, if you do /requireregister but the account already has mmr within the bot, then they can queue up which would allow me to bypass the requirement for unranked accounts
Answer: u can manually add mmr, with `/add mmr`, but u should make a role for unranked ones that sets automatically an mmr, so u dont have to do it manually for every guy


Question: `/lobbychannel pullall`

Although, might there be a certain time before the command actually starts working? Found out that even if I get him to put his discord back in the background it doesn't kick him out anymore, despite it kicking him out for the first 10-ish minutes of me putting the afk timer to false.


Question: How do I get rid of this thing?
Answer: The mvp?


Question: but you can let some roles have higher priority
Answer: is higher the number higher priority? or lower number higher priority?


Question: also the documentation where can i find that?
Answer: Info about this channel


Question: you are just an anomaly

Question: Like the command doesnt work
Answer: It works fine for me

Question: i wonder what happens if you start a queue in a crosschat ...
Answer: hmmmm


Question: Say you have 3 different servers people can play on, queue 1 is playing on server 2 and queue 2 pops, how could players from queue 2 know that server 2 is used and they should head to server 1 or 3? Would there be a way to add an option/is there an option for the players in a queue to pick the server they're going on so that players in the next queue have said server no longer available to be picked?
Answer: My bad, point may have been written a bit wrong. What I meant by 3 different servers were different servers on the game, not discord.


Question: can someone help on this queue bot, once the queue filled up and made the new channel, it wont show how to pick captains or how to pick team
Answer: channel is just empty?


Question: For some reason  this does not work in our discord.  "/player sub player1:@(P2) Rose player2:@btc"             (I always get the error  No matches with @(P2) Rose - (967) found!)
Answer: is Rose in a match in  that channel?


Question: channel is just empty?
Answer: nvm this bot was just a updated version than what i am used to


Question: well... then the error message is valid
Answer: so how do you sub a player who is qued but not in the channel.  Lets say Rose is qued and not here, How do you replace Rose to James.

Question: 
Answer: you can do /roles


Question: its done
Answer: since the update it keeps making a solo queue get added onto their team üò≠


Question: matchmaking with parties seems to be messed up
Answer: i think it just isnt checking if the 4th player in queue is in a party, so it makes the game queue with the first 4, and the 5th is in the party with the 4th so they also get added in ?


Question: 
Answer: /winnermessage format


Question: Excuse my ignorance, still learning. When a queue starts, are players barred from joining the queue again while one match is running? I can test this later but was curious now.

Also, is there a way to block a players from joining a queue again or locking it while a match is in progress? Ideally I want players in an active match not able to requeue until after the match is over, allowing players who want to join the next one to be allowed first grabs. Then after submitting the result, they may join again.
Answer: If a player is in a match, the bot won‚Äôt let the player join a queue until his game is completed üëçüèª


Question: If a player is in a match, the bot won‚Äôt let the player join a queue until his game is completed üëçüèª
Answer: Awesome! Thanks for that. That's what I needed to know.


Question: Thanks again for your help yesterday <@271014487451107329>. Everything worked real well, and I added images for all the maps. Let me know if you want the config or links to images.
Answer: awesome üôÇ Glad its workin brother


Question: If I click revert and press the same result again I get two different results, and it continues to change or sometimes stay the same. Is that normal or am I missing something?
Answer: its due to the streak multiplier, the initial calculation may reset the streak, and that info is lost


Question: i think it just isnt checking if the 4th player in queue is in a party, so it makes the game queue with the first 4, and the 5th is in the party with the 4th so they also get added in ?
Answer: i would disable parties, it was never implemented with matchmaking so its all mysterious behavior


Question: its due to the streak multiplier, the initial calculation may reset the streak, and that info is lost
Answer: Okay, that's good to know. Thank you. It's not a terrible need since MMR is tracked seperately and I'm going to create a plugin or extension for CS2 later on. Right now I'm planning to use the API for CS:GO to track when a match ends and to update the status of the results page after x seconds to give some players time to alt tab and re-queue. Just wanted to know what I was missing from clicking and unclicking it and then back again.


Question: i would disable parties, it was never implemented with matchmaking so its all mysterious behavior
Answer: yeah, have it disabled for now, but would love a fix


Question: building a plugin for csgo would be super cool, should be pretty achievable using the API and webhooks too
Answer: If you have any interested I can provide to you, but not sure how relevant it will be since CS2 will be coming out soon. If they keep both versions it can certainly be more fleshed out.


Question: From my knowledge I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible
Answer: its possible


Question: for sure, thatll should be a priority fix
Answer: eta on that?


Question: how can i change who can use /leaderboard?
Answer: /leaderboardconfig edits


Question: eta on that?
Answer: not very soon, it‚Äôs not the easiest fix


Question: ok i‚Äôll verify this
Answer: Ok I discovered what the real issue with this was (follow thread for refresher)

It turns out I can link multiple queues to one channel, and I can view the leaderboard for each individually, but the bot displays the wrong title on the response.

So I linked 2v2 and 8v8, I did /leaderboard and did 2v2 under queue name, and it correctly displayed the 2v2 leaderboard, but the title was 8v8 leaderboard. 8v8 was the queue I had linked most recently


Question: looks like the leaderboard is the correct data, but the title is referencing the current queue, i will fix the title though
Answer: I apologize too because you said exactly that but I didn't understand without my data


Question: you can use the API, but it won‚Äôt format nicely in excel since it‚Äôs nested json
Answer: the /api/leaderboard/{server_id}/{channel_id} ? Which channel would the channelid have to match to? The queue channel?


Question: What roles

Question: what does your /info look like for autoroles
Answer: I think it is working now, their info looks okay, one sec


Question: When I blocked the bot myself, I end up not seeing the messages and have to click to open the ranked queue and then the teams etc. I don‚Äôt find it a huge deal so I‚Äôd  have the bot unblocked but I find it unnecessary to have the bot dming a person every single time the lose/gain a rank.
Answer: ill check out adding an option to disable


Question: ill check out adding an option to disable
Answer: Thank you, it is nothing urgent or nothing that *must* be changed, but I think it is a little tweak you should add to improve the quality of life for players.


Question: i need the setup for crossfire
Answer: cross fire is similar to a lot of other games that are in <#1068605714098049054>  I would use something like the valorant config to get yourself started and then modify it as you need if you don't want to start from scratch


Question: 
Answer: Read what it is telling you, it says a queue already exists and giving you a command to reset it "/endqueue"


Question: change the /language if you need
Answer: no arabic in this bot


Question: <@189487132392292352> im cross comparing all the roles in that server vs all the auto roles set up, and im only seeing 6 matches
Answer: i dont know <:Shruge:1094709244839862302> literally resassigned every role already


Question: that‚Äôs the same channel ID?
Answer: Same one yeah. I'm gonna try something on my end and see if I can fix it via config again


Question: for  /autoroles mmr set, does only-one-allowed apply to all queues
Answer: I figured it out.

Now, for tournaments, am I able to make the tournaments affect mmr? I'm running a 2v2 tournament and would like it to count towards the 2v2 queue mmr

Question: i dont think anyone changed anything at 10am
Answer: can you give me perms to type in the queue channel so i can check the info


Question: we can hop on a call in a bit if you want, the queue channel with ID=1132753848629461165 looks like it has a bunch of autoroles for IDs that are not valid
Answer: yh join private


Question: it works for me, i just tried by locking at 14:02
Answer: Yeah it doesn‚Äôt do both


Question: for sure, so this is the json I get on match started, it is mostly all the info needed -- in fact I could infer the queue channel name because the queue number is in there:

Question: Settings have been the same for around 2 weeks
Answer: Does it still kicking people


Question: Bot can‚Äôt run other bot commands with slashes i think
Answer: yeah, that would be the other option


Question: This is what the usage is in my mind. We have 3 available custom servers are our disposal. If all 3 are currently being used, my bot will hold the queue until one becomes available. Once one is, it will /forcestart the queue and then everything proceeds as normal
Answer: if you have access to servers we can set up something cooler


Question: i currently have an available integration where the bot can manage servers for you
Answer: <a:think3D:684191716877795361>  oh yeah?


Question: Is there a way to get the bot to move people from a specific voice channel into different temp team channels? I want the voice channel to be the main one everyone uses when they join our discord, aka "Chill" channel. Once the queue is started and the teams are selected I want them to be moved into the Team 1 and Team 2 calls. What the bot is currently doing is making a new text and voice channel for the queue, and everyone must join that channel in order for the match to start and for it to automatically move everyone to their team chats.
Answer: U can‚Äôt delete the queue voice channel and then split teams


Question: Queue configuration saved as: RAAQG
Answer: I see why if you set a lobby channel they won‚Äôt get dragged


Question: Tested it
Answer: was this talking about moving to team channels, or something else?


Question: was this talking about moving to team channels, or something else?
Answer: From lobby to queue


Question: give it to the bot, not the role
Answer: Both bot and role have all permissions in this category + role have all permissions in discord server as well


Question: For some reason the bot put 5 on a team vs 1, its supposed to be 3v3
Answer: Someone joined with a party?


Question: Is there any way to disable the DM that is sent alongside the AFK timer?
Answer: nope


Question: Can I restore a queue that we used /end queue on we ment to do /cancel but now

mmr increases/ decreases were reset
The "unfair" teams option now appears
And it doesn‚Äôt pick the map for you
Answer: if u did /endqueue, the bot will show u a code, just do /load and put the code


Question: 
Answer: then the code is gone


Question: then the code is gone
Answer: Gotcha


Question: <@145305657237700608> This is happening with a different player as well
Answer: no parties?


Question: LALPC

Question: It‚Äôs a discord thing
Answer: As in discord being a bit broken or individual user settings of some kind?


Question: I run a FFA discord and just added your bot to it. In halo the top 4 usually are considered winners in a FFA is there anyway to make vote for the top 4 players to win instead of just the one player that got 1st?
Answer: that‚Äôs not supported


Question: Dang
Answer: Think the only way to do this would be for an admin to *manually* give MMR/points to top 4 excluding the voted winner.


Question: could you share your code /save
Answer: It's OCOBJ


Question: Can I throw some bread your way to enable autoroles for points, global, shared from all queues or is it just not possible?
Answer: nah, i dont see any benefit


Question: nah, i dont see any benefit
Answer: It would allow servers to create global ranking systems in-server with points shared across all queues while keeping MMR queue specific for balancing.


Question: you can just copy the autoroles config to each queue
Answer: they're named differently to retain their respective leaderboards


Question: points are global themselves
Answer: Sorry if I‚Äôm making it sound harder than it is lol just trying to make sure I understand I appreciate your patience and even the implementation of the command üß°

So if I wanted /autoroles to go based off of points, and I want players to be able to gain and lose points through multiple different queues with their own different names and their point total is shared between them

ie. A 2v2 queue earned a player 500 points, then that player plays a 4v4 and earns 1000. That players point total in the server is now 1500 and auto roles will understand this.

Is this is an accurate understanding? For a players points to he gained and loss globally from one pool of points which auto roles would understand


Question: crazy, thanks a ton!
Answer: Come message private please


Question: When a voting menu allows multiple choices per user, it does not select the final choice until the timer expires even if one of the options has the unanimous vote.
But it is the intended behavior because another option could become unanimous too within the voting time, is it correct?
Also, if there are two or more options with tied voting does the bot select the final choice at random?
Answer: is this talking about a /votingmenu ?


Question: is this talking about a /votingmenu ?
Answer: No, this case occurs in the map selection vote. 

(I am managing the bot on the same server as them.)


Question: besides that, seems like it should have ended the vote, ill check
Answer: Thank you. And by the way, I have a question: is it a spec that autoroles are removed when winning at the upper limit of MMR?

When a player with an MMR of 12 won, the roll was removed. The MMR remains at 12.
We have not tested what happens when a player at the lower end is defeated.

We have not tested what happens when a player at the lower end is defeated.
Answer: It should remove the role and then update the role for the user


Question: if there were seperate wins/losses commands, you would just set the loss multiplier to 0 for those ranks
Answer: I love the idea of a win/loss command

How would points floor work, doesnt that set the lowest one can reach?
So for this players would still be able to rank up and gain points, but after exceeding that floor threshold they could no longer go down in points or auto role


Question: yea for mmr floor, say the floor is set to 500. Anyone who is above 500 wont be able to drop below. Anyone who is below 500 won't be able to lose any MMR, but will gain MMR as per usual
Answer: > "Anyone who is above 500 wont be able to drop below"

> "Anyone who is below 500 wont be able to lose any"

Sounds like /points floor is what im looking for üôè


Question: <@145305657237700608> I'm gonna continue the conversation with you and <@648140340645068832> 
We currently have the following four issues:
~~1. When tie is enabled, a force-started game becomes tie after a certain period (our server is for Civilization multiplayer games that usually takes 2-3 hours so basically every force-started game goes to tie)~~ solved, thank you <@648635725964902411> 
2. Users seem to receive a DM even though we had `/autoroles notify` applied. Am I receiving it during testing the bot because I'm an admin?
3. Among the roles shown in the image below, only the yellow one doesn't work. Does the order matter?
Answer: to avoid the tie, you should increase the time of `/timer matchcleanup`


Question: yea the bot bugs like that sometimes for unknown reason, let me restart that node
Answer: Working again, thanks


Question: to avoid the tie, you should increase the time of `/timer matchcleanup`
Answer: Thanks I set it up

3. Among the roles shown in the image below, only the yellow one doesn't work. Does the order matter?
Answer: oops, looks like i missed the notify setting with the updates yesterday, will fix


Question: how do you setup the roles?
Answer: which ones


Question: its not showing mmr in names
Answer: did you enable?


Question: and order doesn't matter, maybe you have it set where each player can only get 1 role at a time
Answer: Understood, I've set the autoroles again (as I don't see if exclusive assignment is enabled or not) and hope it works now


Question: oops, looks like i missed the notify setting with the updates yesterday, will fix
Answer: Please let me know when you've addressed it, thank you


Question: did you enable?
Answer: yes i think so


Question: yes i think so
Answer: /info last page


Question: also it doesnt auto give roles when people join servee

Answer: done


Question: done
Answer: for specific roles, losses to be doubled. Would that be /Points multiplier ?


Question: can someone explain why they‚Äôre getting more elo
Answer: placement matches perhaps?


Question: <@145305657237700608> sorry for the ping but is there a cmd to like unregister all the people who aren‚Äôt in the server anymore
Answer: to hide from the leaderboard?


Question: placement matches perhaps?
Answer: it was their 8th games


Question: to hide from the leaderboard?
Answer: yk how when u do /ign it registers a new acc how do i remove people who have left the server so they jus don‚Äôt take space


Question: can someone explain why they‚Äôre getting more elo
Answer: mmr difference causes them to lose less?


Question: that too, higher elo team will gain less and lose more
Answer: yeah they should have gained 12.8 im pretty sure


Question: Also, is there any way to let a certain role use some commands and not all? like unlock or lock the queue but they cant wipe the leaderboard or change any settings with ut
Answer: no, you can't do something like that to let a specific role use a specific command, besides adding a /staffrole


Question: Lock and unlock should be working fine now
Answer: yeah different thing


Question: so that the person can execute commands in the bot, does it have to have the admin permission box turned on?
Answer: didnt when u invited the bot, the bot asked for perms


Question: I know he asked for permission, but the question is that I want to know if I can add a role to be able to execute commands without having administrator privileges
Answer: you dont need admin to run commands, only manage channels, but you can add a /staffrole


Question: `/teamnames`
Answer: well i guess i am stupid for some reason the channels always get called by the name of the player in it and how i set it up may it be because the channels are set for 1v1?


Question: Maybe u toggled /teamnames captain?
Answer: well i will try it xd


Question: Maybe u toggled /teamnames captain?
Answer: still not works maybe because its a 1v1 queue?


Question: actually, seems like a single player team takes precedent
Answer: can i do anything about it?


Question: not rn, ill update the ordering so /teamnames is priority
Answer: when might this happen?


Question: ill update today or tomorrow
Answer: maybe a /point multiplier as well üëÄ

Question: hello , i want to get all of command's this bot how plz ?
Answer: https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/


Question: Is there a way to do some kind of soft cap on MMR? For example once a player reaches 1700, the settings for /mmr change set swap to something different? Use case would be I don't want players who reach the max rank/mmr of 1700 to end up super high up in mmr, but they also don't want to be capped out at 1700.

Question: Hello, I have a quick question. I use neatqueue in a small server to run matchmaking for Smash Ultimate. Is there an easy way to ensure that after players finish a match and requeue that those players wont be matched against one another?
Answer: you mean not again the same players?


Question: Right, I think the issue is though, because a lobby is made immediately when two players enter the queue then the queue is always empty when the two players reenter and so theyre immediately paired. Unless theres a method to set a requeue delay for only one player or change the range at which players mmr can match them against an opponent?
Answer: There‚Äôs /requeue delay


Question: nathan (795) and vacuolatebeef (783) are duod together, so are carseat (680) and hibachi (639) 
these duos each have 2 of the highest 4 players in the lobby, so why do they get paired together?
Answer: there is an issue currently where team balancing with parties does not swap parties, so depending on the join order you can get an unfair setup


Question: That effects both players, no? I haven‚Äôt tried the requeue command bc that was my assumption. If I do a 60 second requeue timer and both players queue after the timer ends the same thing is going to happen I think. I may just need to try it out though.
Answer: i‚Äôm not sure there is much else you can do besides use matchmaking queue type like you are

Question: is there a way for the party queue to allow a minimum amount of players? For example, I want my queue to start with 4 players per team minimum, allowing up to 11 per team. But I want the queue to be able to allow parties of under 11 to join the queue. Because up to 11 players are allowed per team, but it doesn't need to be even numbers per team, just minimum of 4 per team.
Answer: is this for a game that allows any number of players on a team? or is this to allow subbing within the team itself?


Question: like one rank's mmr starting mmr is 2300 but when it goes into another q it resets to 1000

Question: is this for a game that allows any number of players on a team? or is this to allow subbing within the team itself?
Answer: This is for  FIFA pro clubs. Teams have 11 spots each available on the game itself, but I want them to be able to start a game as long as they have 4 players each. So for example, one party of 4 might enter the queue, fully ready to play against another party who queues with a full 11. Does this make more sense?

I want the queue to allow parties up to 11 to join, as there are 11 open spots per team, but the queue is allowed to start when there is at least 4 on each team, as parties will not always have 11 people available to play. The problem right now is if I set the amount of players per team to 11 for the queue, parties of under 11 are not able to join. I want parties of atleast 4 to be able to join. Please help me out!

Question: Is it technically feasible to implement the proposed dynamic ranked queue system, where queues close and open based on player ranks and levels, to ensure balanced matchmaking and provide a more competitive gaming experience?
Answer: 1.    Join the Ranked Queue: Players of all skill levels can initially join the general ranked queue. This is where you begin your journey.
    2.    Earn Your Stripes: As you play and improve, you‚Äôll climb the ranks and strive to reach the designated level or role that marks you as a high-skilled player.
    3.    Queue Advancement: Once the required number of players achieves the target rank, we‚Äôll close the current queue for those players, ensuring they face off against opponents of similar skill.
    4.    New Challenge: A brand-new ranked queue will open up for high-skilled players who‚Äôve met the criteria. This is where the competition intensifies!

Question: Hey <@145305657237700608> , have a few questions about the bot

1) I want to set 30 mmr per win\loss, but it should depend on average mmr of teams. E.G. if your team have 600 mmr average, and enemy 500 mmr average, then **ALL TEAM** gain +27 and lose -33 (So all players in team gain same mmr, but gain depends on team strength like faceit) Is it possible?

2) Is it possible to make that players cant be captains for 2 games in a row? I want to use "vote for captains" but players who were captains in previous game should not be included in vote

3) Is it possible to make /cancel that need 9\10 votes and winner message still should have 6\10 votes?
Answer: 1) No this isnt a thing currently, everyone has indepedent MMR changes. You can almost get what you want if you do `/message winnermessage format`
2) Also not a thing, but maybe a feature request
3) Thats a good idea i think, being able to override specific vote requirements

Question: We did a test earlier and people had to join VC‚Äôs to start. How can i disable that?
Answer: Voice channels mode to optional


Question: question, so i have no clue how to get the results i want. im pretty stupid with bots, althought i just want to set this up for some fun. im using the same model as someone else and i cant figure out how he did some of his features.

Firstly, he has a waiting room VC and when the queue gets full, it auto pull everyone into the VC for their queue so that the match start automatically once everyone is in and auto pulls them in their new team VC. Mine doesn't do any of that.

2nd when all players join the queue VC, instead of the match starting automatically and picking the teams based on MMR, it makes us do a vote for captains, random, etc. even tho during setup i just put normal individual queues.

also if i did the advanced setup, i noticed it doesnt put the match details in the temporary queue text channel, it puts it in the public channel for some reason, when i only do the basic setup it categorizes it correctly which is weird.
Answer: first: `/lobbychannel`
second: this is the default setting, change via `/teamselection`
third: What match details?

Question: Is there a way to do a dynamic scoreboard and winners? Like I'm trying to do something for Battle Royale and it's not as simple as "XYZ won" . Is there a way I can give certain points for certain placements ? And then after each match just fill it out "team 1 got 1st, team 2 got 13th etc"

I have a question. The MMR that you set to a user with the command (/sett mrr) is global? I mean, does it apply to every queue in the server?

Thanks!
Answer: <@857633321064595466> goldenrule


Question: <@857633321064595466> goldenrule
Answer: All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!


Question: hey this is not really an important issue or a problem for us, but when we have a role requirement then the leaderboards have inaccurate green or red indicators, im assuming because it calculates a difference in rank across leaderboards of the same queue
Answer: hmm that makes sense

Answer: 1. Disable `/captains reshuffle`
2. Team channels are gonna be the size of the team, you cant make it custom size, it will depend on the team size, the only thing you can do is adding a spectator role or disable the channel restrictions, this last one will make the vc unrestricted and then anyone could join

Question: Is there a way to change the temporary VC names like there is for the text channels? Specifically just different names for the different queues
Answer: Yep, `/teamnames set`


Question: Scheduling auto commands, in my case leaderboards in the am at 8cst
Answer: taking a look now, what did you try that broke?


Question: the only way i can think of doing it currently is with `/leaderboardconfig monthly`, then setting up some `/autoroles games`
Answer: Problem is that'd remove everybody's roles, even the ones who played 6 games the previous month, right? And we need stats to not be reset.

My attempted solution was to use the "points" system (e.g. 1 game played = +1 point), and do some form of resetting everyone's points every month.

But I tentatively concluded that we need a way of setting someone's points to 0 or 6, nothing in between. We can start by e.g. /points ceiling 6, then we could do something like points = (int)points/6 * 6 with integer division which would yield 0 or 6 only. Don't know if that's possible though


Question: so im not sure what could be interferring, i cant replicate it
Answer: btw its been fine now that I put it back to 1 large category

Question: Idk if you're talking to me or the other guy but i'll explain my issue. I have a "Chill" lobby voice channel which I set as my lobby with the bot. When I start a matchmaking lobby with teams, it drags all the players voice the "Chill" voice channel into the "Queue" voice channel that it makes. The bot makes "Team" voice channels as well, but it does not drag people into their teams like it used to from the "Queue" VC. Is there a timer on there now or some sort of bug, because I'm using the same preset I've used before and it doesn't work anymore.
Answer: must be some sort of bug then


Question: must be some sort of bug then
Answer: Gotcha


Question: could you elaborate
Answer: once you queued enough players, the vc waits about 30s to pull everyone, instead of immidiately. 
once captains are picked, and the first pick goes to captain 'x' captain, but once he picks his first player, it pulls him into the wrong team. ('y' captain). the selection of teams goes to the wrong captain.


Question: there‚Äôs no timer for voting for the winner though?
Answer: Ya there‚Äôs no timer for winner I‚Äôm talking about the setup of the match like picking captains and how captains are determined

Question: 
Answer: Thank you


Question: Can you explain mmr Variance? Especially with up to 50 MMR only in a discord
Answer: i'm not a mod or on support i just have been experimenting a lot with the bot. in plain man's terms, the higher you set the variance value the lower the varying amount of outputted mmr will be. so lower variance will have higher swings in mmr and higher variance will have lower swings.


Question: 
Answer: `/captains drafttype`


Question: 
Answer: You need to link up the channel


Question: You need to link up the channel
Answer: Got you, any chance to input the names of the teams?


Question: But it will be constant not variable for user input
Answer: ok, maybe would be a good option for the feature for scrims etc


Question: Can this be changed? or the leaderboard is only able to show individual mmr?
Answer: i think is just individual stats


Question: im not sure what you are trying to it
Answer: to reiterate I'm experimenting with dynamic mmr gain and loss as players gain and lose mmr


Question: looking to set up role exclusive mmr gain and mmr loss across a variety of roles, though we have a couple of issues

- `/mmr change set [amount] (loser_mmr) (static)` adjusts mmr loss, though the lack of a role argument doesn't seem fitting for role exclusive mmr loss.
- Decay works in the same fashion as the above issue; we'd like to adjust decay to be active past a certain mmr threshold, 
- `/mmr multiplier set [role] [multiplier]` works fantastically for role exclusive mmr gain; however it doesn't seem to work both ways according to the description.

thought I'd ask in support before making a feature request in case anyone has solutions
Answer: these issues I addressed were issues I found trying to execute my idea under a single queue


Question: Havent made any changes that I'm aware of but the bot isnt dragging people in and out of channels. Is there some command im missing to reactivate it?

Answer: wich roles


Question: Also do y'all the reset manually?
Answer: <:hmm:1172617247320195123>


Question: no, changing queue type does not modify the config much

Question: Queues with the same name share stats but no configs

Question: is there a way to speed up the bot to automatically drag everyone from the queue to the "queue" vc channel? its taking about 2 mins after queue is filled
Answer: You must have ur queue in matchmaking type?


Question: You must have ur queue in matchmaking type?
Answer: correct


Question: That means:
Players join the queue, and once there are enough players within their MMR range, a match is created.

So it will take minutes to find players within their MMR range. You can easily change it via `/queuetype`, and setting it to *PUGs/Normal Individual Queue*, this means the match will be created when the queue is full.
Answer: /test again

Question: <@857633321064595466> stats
Answer: > ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.

Question: So I've been having a problem in my server that I'm curious if anyone else has any solution for.
The problem is that new players (who are often times far less skilled than returning players) are valued (mmr wise) at the same level as players who are returning players. This is especially noticeable at the start of seasons where everyone has the same mmr. Right now players have played a bunch of games in the season, and when a brand new player joins, the bot values them at a higher mmr than what is usually their skill level, causing more unbalanced games. Setting the starting mmr to a lower value could work in the middle of the season, however it would end up not changing anything once a new season starts.

So the question is, is there any way to have a proper season reset with the bot where it sets the player's mmr in relation to his old mmr, not just the baseline? Or is there a way to ensure brand new players get a lower mmr rather than the same as returning players?
Answer: if you are using autoroles, you could give every role a different starting mmr?

Question: Hi, I am wanting to integrate https://api.neatqueue.com/api/queue/channel_id/players ... Into a custom JS file. 

I am looking to grab the players within the queue (in order) to display them when live-streaming. 

But, when I test out the API endpoint and input my channel ID I am getting the following (Error: response status is 403) ... 

Could you please guide me on how to integrate with your API's or send me a guide / reference for integration?

Could it maybe be certain channel permissions that I need to setup to make this work properly?
Answer: Are u integrating the api key in the header?

Answer: I haven't yet... I was simply inputting my channel ID, then using the execute tab to see the response. I do now see the "Authorize" tab in the top right of the interface. I guess I have to generate an API key via the instructions located under "Webhooks" section in your docs first before proceeding with testing the endpoint?

Answer: Is there a way to set the certain permissions granted to each person in that queue match?


Question: sounds like an issue with permissions on the category perhaps
Answer: The perms in the category is good.
So, in my server I have it set so that `everyone` doesn't have any permissions;
When the channels are created, the permissions are set correctly for the needed roles.
Then once all players have connected to the voice channel; the permissions of the VC reset and are defaulted to only `everyone`.

I think /roles is what you'd use for that. I'm pretty sure I've seen a way to disable or at least hide mmr, but you'd have to look at docs for that

Answer: > ### How stats for a queue are linked

Question: I have ~~betting~~ predictions set up, and I thought it was going well until I noticed an issue today.

Even if someone doesn't bet on a match, their points go up whether they win or lose their match. I just did a test-run. Nobody bet on the match, and I checked the stats of two players on separate teams pre and post match. Both players went up in points, even though one lost and one won.

Is this intentional? I thought a player was only supposed to have their points affected if they won or lost.

Also, only the player on the left has the role allowed to bet. The one on the right does not, and never has, according to him.
Answer: by default, every players gets 100 points for each match they play


Question: by default, every players gets 100 points for each match they play
Answer: If I set this to 0, they will only gain/lose if they place a bet. Am I understanding correctly?


Question: I had a few queues on various channels for test, after deleting the channels (without using /endqueue before the deletion), I still see the queues at the bottom of the: /serverstats info
Even after resetting all stats, the queues are there.
Can I remove them somehow from there? Maybe I should recreate the queues with the same names and then /enqueue them or reset the stats? Is there any other better solution?
Answer: could you screenshot it and show?

Answer: since there are matches played, it will stay there


Question: since there are matches played, it will stay there

Question: Another question. If the temporary channel is created as thread and the parent queue channel doesn't give rights to players to use bot commands, will they be able to use commands on the temporary threads that is attached to this parent queue channel?
Answer: threads inherit the same perms as the channel iirc


Question: Does /substitute need to be used on the temporary channel or can it be used to any other channel? If on any channel, does the channel need to be linked to the queue channel by the /link command?
Answer: must be used in the match channel


Question: why not just let them use commands?
Answer: I would like the queue channel to be clean, just with the queue (even though I know that is sticks to the bottom), I created separated channel for commands.
I will just use a normal match channel then or enable the commands.


Question: hey, when I want to use the /leaderboard command it tells me to vote on the top.gg site but even after voting it still does not work, what should I do? From what I can tell there is also no way for me to get access to the leaderboards from the website.

Question: which DM is that?
Answer: i looked around in the documentation but couldnt find anything


Question: its the only way to provide feedback to the user

Answer: It redirects to it after clicking the title,  I now generated new /leaderboard to make sure and clicked the title, this is the url, I have not changed it. But I have set url for my other queue and maybe this somehow broke the first one. I may try to set new url, but this looks like a bug.

Question: I know, I will probably have to.

So any chance that you would add such thing? And if yes more or less when?
Answer: throw it in <#911057745204105237> first and can think about it a bit more üòÑ


Question: I also have another question that I already asked some days ago but I think without answer:

Will players be flagged by avoiding voting for winners many times? Looks like no, but that could be useful. At least in 1v1 this could work, I see that it may be problematic in normal voting because not everyone needs to vote, but in 1v1 where it is the most needed it could be useful.
Answer: the anticheat flag is only for incorrectly voting, not for not voting at all

Question: but you won't reset any stats
Answer: hey is there a way to link mmr between 3 different queues to one leaderboard?


Question: <@857633321064595466> stats
Answer: > ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.


Question: I know this is probably highly unlikely, but is there a way to limit a certain role in the queue?

For instance, we sometimes have 6 goalkeepers join, and that's honestly not good lol. So if we could limit it to, idk, 3, that would be awesome.
Answer: are you talking about when it shows `+4` for the role for example


Question: yes but how do we sync it with a text channel?
Answer: the leaderboard is always linked to the queue


Question: Hey, I have a player who left the discord and i need to edit him off the leaderboard but it cant find player so it wont allow me to remove his points
Answer: easy fix would be to add `/rolerequirement add role:@everyone`


Question: are you talking about when it shows `+4` for the role for example
Answer: No. We have 22 people queue up, but if there was a way to limit a role from queueing up, so only 3-4 people with the GK role can be included in that 22.
I don't think I can describe it very well.


Question: are you using `/roles` ?
Answer: We aren't. We just have it set where the channel isn't viewable by people without a certain role.

2. 8 players join
3. they are pushed into their VCs

Question: <@145305657237700608> Shouldn't the transcripts show the situation on the match channel to the very end? (https://www.neatqueue.com/transcript/266243131853373440/375)
I don't see all votes on this (and others) transcripts.

Also I see that there are 50 last messages. Why not more? Maybe as a premium feature if not possible for free?
Also would be nice to always see the team summary since the match info that contains the link sometimes show the bugged @2523253463545345 username
Answer: i arbitrarily chose 50, it takes time for all the messages to be fetched and save so it just stalls out how long the channel exists for


Question: i arbitrarily chose 50, it takes time for all the messages to be fetched and save so it just stalls out how long the channel exists for
Answer: The messages are not as important to me as to see the not bugged @ usernames and most importantly the final results of the vote. Could you maybe fix this somehow to make sure that the channel is not closed till the final votes are fetched?
I am now investigating a case where players voted wrongly on purpose and that would be very helpful.


Question: I want to set roles per rank and im getting confused with setting mmr and points, what would be the easiest method to implement this ?
Answer: `/autoroles mmr set` You will for example say `Role @Gold` from 100 MMR to 200 MMR then next rank would be `Role @Diamond` from 200 MMR to 300 MMR and like that


Question: `/autoroles mmr set` You will for example say `Role @Gold` from 100 MMR to 200 MMR then next rank would be `Role @Diamond` from 200 MMR to 300 MMR and like that

Question: one challenge im facing, is when neatque decides on the maps/modes for a series, we'd like to follow the standards for the game where a bo5 is always in this order [objective] - [slayer] - [objective] - [objective] - [slayer].. is there any way to define these sorts of requirements/limits to the quebot?
Answer: any ways to address the gametype requirement structure?


Question: `/gamemode selection gamemode_choice:Ordered`
Answer: our goal is to follow the basic logic below

Guides:
> Game 2 and Game 5 are always Slayer
> map setlist should never have a an option for players to choose a re-occurring game mode

Setlist potential:
> Game 1: [Strongholds, KOTH, Oddball or CTF] 
> Game 2: [Slayer] 
> Game 3: [Strongholds, KOTH, Oddball or CTF] 
> Game 4: [Strongholds, KOTH, Oddball or CTF] 
> Game 5: [Slayer]

Example of how choices affect presented options:
> If Game 1 is chosen to be CTF, options for Game 3 would be [Strongholds, KOTH, or Oddball]
> Then, if Game 3 is Strongholds, options for Game 4 would be [KOTH or Oddball]
> Meanwhile, our goal is to make it so Game 2 and Game 5 don't provide gamemode choices, since they're statically slayer and only allow map to be chosen.

Question: <@857633321064595466> stats
Answer: > ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
