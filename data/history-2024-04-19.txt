<@!145305657237700608> hello. I heard your bot was the best for queues for valorant events. Could you please help me set it up on my server?

Thanks,
AlchonFire
sure, ill help in DMs
Hi <@!145305657237700608> could you help me out?
sure
What is winner message ID
For selecting a winner
<@!167376429212893184>
usually you dont need to use /selectwinner, the buttons handle it for you
we are just trying to figure out
in case queue somehow doesnt work
we might have to select winner as admins
pretty neat tool btw
thanks!
Does the leaderboard only show wins based on all game wins
Like im trying to have 1s, 2s and 3s game modes
the way it works is that all stats are tied to the Queue name
so if you name them differently, they will have different stats
So i would have my members name them the same
to have the stats placed where there should be
you only need to specify the /queuename
any games under that name have their own stats
so you can create 2 queues with 2 different names, and they will have different stats
oh nice
how do the stats show by chance
like the leaderboards
is it just a embed
yea /stats and /leaderboard are both embeds
stats is an embedded picture
after you end a que it really doesnt make a new one
Like i did the action
you dont need to /endqueue, thatll end all queues going forward
looks like you dont have manage channels permissions as well?
or whoever is trying right now
<@!189960013307969536>
yeah its the mange channel perm
Hold on
i think i got to work
nice, looks like its fine now
yeah i got it working
also
why does it create new vc everytime
is it creating a new Queue channel and not deleting?
like after a que is ran it keeps going
it doesnt end
its always gonna keep running queues
after the queue is done being setup, it is reset
its just hard to mod if people dont play the games and report they won
by default you need a majority to vote for the winner, so its not like the losing team can just say they won
is that what you mean?
well no
If you start que per say, 
they get in there teams
then it asks who won
people will often vote
free for all
is that why there is a majoirty command
not sure why people would randomly vote, that defeats the purpose of even joining the queue
but yea the majority ensures the losing team cant say they won
also, you cant vote if you arent part of the queue
ok makes sense
ill have to make some rules with this bot
let me know if you have any ideas to make it work better for you!
I work in content creator discord just want to avoid kids not playing there games
like the bot asks
another question
are you able to run 2 different ques
or just 1
it‚Äôs 1 queue per channel, so you just have to create a different channel
but there can be multiple queues in progress in one channel
after the queue is reset when teams are setup, you are free to have new people join immediately
then when you end the que does the leaderboard resset
nope, all the stats stay as long as you don‚Äôt /resetdata
and all stats are tied to the queue name
ok when i ended the que the leaderboard did not pop up
you can only see the leaderboard if the queue is running in that channel
since you can have multiple queues with different stats
so if reran the que i could see the leaderboard again
if the queue isn‚Äôt running in that channel, you can /link to the channel that has the queue running
yup exactly, if it‚Äôs the same queue name
let me try agai
ok i see now
it keeps the data under that same name
wow fucking amazing
how can i set my mods to have perms for the bot without giving admin perms
you just need to give them manage channels permission
oh that should give em the abilty to play with the bot
you don‚Äôt need any perms to play
only to edit the queue
Thanks man i really enjoyed the help im off to do other things
no prob
Hello, wanted to ask how can I put the captain pick mod for team ? I didn't find the command ?
also another question, is it possible to add a notifications when the queue is ready for everyone ? seems that they don't get a notification
you can pick teams via captains after everyone joins the queue and selects captains
also, it does already send an @ in chat with the names of all the players in the queue
these things don‚Äôt happen when the queue size is 2, since there‚Äôs no point for captains, and there‚Äôs no interactive team creation at all
<@297040314898841601>
Does everyone see those button or only the admin ?
like, I thought I could make my own setup from admins options, so I would chose captain or randoms, etc ...
everyone sees those options so that the players can choose how they want to pick teams
ok so its a vote
right ?
yup exactly
ok I see
also
does people got a way to kick someone whos afk from the queue ?
when the queue is full, it‚Äôll give everyone 5 minutes to join
anyone who isn‚Äôt ready gets kicked automatically
so you need to ready up before it launches ?
also, the queue resets after 2 hours of inactivity
you can use /queueresettimer to change the length of time
ok that's nice
yea, by default everyone needs to join the voice channel to ready up
it has to works with voice channel ?
like I made team channel but
I wanted to let them the choice if they want to go in vocal or not
like if theres a team having their own discord
you can use /voicechannemode to set if voice channels are required
it works best if everyone is playing from the same discord though!
voice channels are private for teams too so no issue with ransoms joining
Yeah I made my own community discord
very nice, let me know if you want to make any tweaks to have it work better for you guys
sure, thanks for your help
ok when the game starts but it doesnt move
did it create a voice channel?
<@189960013307969536>
looks like the bot doesn‚Äôt have permissions
yeah
i reset
everything where the bot was
I got to work
sounds good, it was probably either the channel or category that had some restriction on managing channels
yeah it did
nice, glad it‚Äôs working
how do i have it so when players join its like a round robin set of players
so like lets say i want 4mans but teammates to rotate
that‚Äôs not a thing right now unfortunately, your best bet would be to do captains and pick the teams
or you can do random teams
random teams let‚Äôs you vote to reshuffle or not
yeah im talking
game 1 - team set
game 2 - team set
game 3 - team set
here one sec
something like this
then you just report the games won
yea i get that, might be worth looking into adding at some point
yeah no worries
For the default channel which would be the vc can you have 2 que have the same vc for that or no
yup that works fine
next question
can players be in the default vc channel while trying to join que
yes that‚Äôs fine, anyone can be in there
when a queue pops, it‚Äôll pull anyone in that queue into the voice
him ok
so you can technically use a single channel as like a ‚Äòhub‚Äô for all queues
Hello, i'm back for some questions again üôÇ
So basicly, I made an european pro soccer online discord, it's a new football game where one guy can pick a position and play it on the field 1st/3rd view. I find this bot really interesting for games being ready with the queue. So At this moment, it shows like this.
people can sign in 3vs3/4vs4/5vs5 etc ...
I wanted to know if there was a possibility
if someone sign in 3vs3, but was also signed in 5vs5, is there a way if the 5vs5 is full, that it unsign him in 3vs3 ? I know in any logic, someone would unsign himself in the other channel, but its internet so, can't control everyone, but there's already a punishment system if someone don't follows the rules
I know in any case that it will kick him if he doesn't vote but
also, I don't know if I can find this statistic somewhere, but can I check how many games someone played ? I guess it counts when the queue is ready
I wanted to make a ranking with numbers of game being played, like : Beginners/Advanced/Veteran, but the the game doesn't count those right now so
So people would have their ranks depending of games played, on discord

Wanted also to know, if it's possible, to add like an option to automatically start the queue ( with a vote system, at least half or majority of the queue ) like next to Join queue/Leave queue. Because in this game we can play with a Single Goalkeeper. so in a 4vs4 game, we could start with 7 players.

Sorry to make a big message like this, but your bot is the only one really interesting I could find üëç
<@!297040314898841601> Currently you can see the number of games played by checking your wins and losses, both which are shown in /stats
Ill add a 'Games' leaderboard since I think that would be nice to see
I also like the idea of removing people from multiple queues once their queue starts, Ill look into adding that soon
Not sure how I feel about the vote to start queue system though, it feels like it would barely get any usage
yeah, I know, for valorant, csgo games, its useless
maybe as an option ? for custom games
Yeah, I was just not sure to use the mmr system right now, Not sure if people will vote that they lost and might troll, or maybe I didn't really understand the system
unless the admin can change if someone troll a vote ?
community might be big
by default the vote requires a majority (/requiredvotes), so a single person or team cant troll the vote
you can also /selectwinner to choose the winning team yourself
im gonna add a way to revert/change the outcome of past games too, that would be a super nice feature
thing is, I might not be online all the time and check peoples game, I have to see how it works at start
so thats why I was asking if there was a way to change the win/loss
if something goes wrong
So yes I guess it would be nice indeed üëç
its just that i'm waiting before launching the discord that everything is ok
fair enough, seems like the bot would work pretty well for you, the other stuff just makes life easier
So just for the votestart thing, do you think it might be possible to add this as an option for custom games ? Or you rather not bother with this
otherwise guess we will do without it
how often do you play games without the full teams?
really depends of the activity, but sometimes, and like can happen often, that if it takes too long to wait for one last guy, we just run the game with a single keeper
but not sure if it can cause a problem about the mmr stats tho
unless the guy who's GK doesn't have any win/lose point
yea, havent tested with uneven teams, im sure it would break some stuff
mmr would be fine, just some other things
tbf I was not thinking about using the mmr anyway, just a way to help us sign players, ready it and we launch the game. there might be a mmr system later in prosocceronline but since its an early access, gotta wait
i'll see if I can do something fun with it on our discord
but my priority would just count games tbf
wouldn't care that much about win/loses
or any mmr points, but if it can helps me I will use it
might as well just use the mmr, even if you guys dont really care about it
itll just store all the stats anyways
So, for the vote of the winner
it must be a majority right
so the opponent team who lost the game, has to vote for the winner
at least some of them
yup, at least one loser needs to vote
but theres no option right now to correct something if theres a troll vote right ?
no easy revert for a specific game, you can manually set players mmr/wins/losses etc
gonna add that soon
ok so I can still change manually for players
good
yea /setmmr, /setwins, /setlosses
Nice
<@!297040314898841601> you can now easily modify/revert any past games, like we talked about
seems awesome
just a question about the modchannel
can I just put like One and only channel, and dump multiple channel infos in ?
like infos from 3vs3 and 5vs5 ?
yup, the mod channel is set for the entire server
so all queues feed into it
thats nice
Nice work mate, didn't expect it to be that fast !
Can I give the admin power to moderators btw ?
or is it only the admin who can handle it ?
same permissions as all admin stuff, just need manage channels permission
ok, yeah I don't really know everything since it's my first discord
so i'm a bit lost ; p
understandable
mmh, I had an error when I wanted to set my queue manager channel
did I miss a step ?
bot was down for a sec, try now
works
nice, im sure there will be some issues with it though
yes, will report if theres any problem
Got a question also about the total games count, if people votes disable mmr, will it count as a game played ? I would have eventually just disable this mmr vote and only make a count game indicator with the /leaderboard.
Because in my case, tons of people just forgets to vote tho, if that's not possible, I will just randomly choose a winner with the queue manager.
Got a bug with the DM message, seems like both captains dont get the private message with all infos
it did work when we tried 1v1 whitelight and me though. The one that didnt work was a 3v3. The queue number was  1570.
we reproduced again with queue 1571
we have had an instance of 6v6 that didnt start even though every players were picked
did you by chance change the queue name after some people had queued?
currently no stats count, but i think changing to just not count mmr is better
Yeah I think it was the case
I added a 6vs6 channel kinda fast and I think people were in
Yeah if I asked for that, it's because atm, i'm doing a level system with numbers of game played, but sometimes people don't vote for the enable/disable mmr so game doesn't count.
gotcha, yea i‚Äôll switch it to always count stats, and i‚Äôll look into disabling the mmr system
Nice work mate, I really like it
but is there a way to split the teams ? I tried /numberofteams, but, don't have like Team 1 on left and Team 2 on right
for now you still arent queuing into a specific team, just the role
gonna have to set the role size to 2 for each one, that way everyone can join
from there its the same team selection methods
so I can't really use it right now, still have to do with captains pick ? Have to wait being able to split into 2 teams ?
well, you can still use any team  selection mode
but if you have teams predetermined that you want to use, then no
like if you queue random, itll randomly split using the roles
atm I would just let the people being able join roles, into team 1 and team 2, not sure if I understand correctly when you said predetermined teams
like im assuming you want people to be able to choose their team right?
once team 1 and team 2 are full, the game starts
their team
+ their role
ill have to add that later yea
No problem
for now its just queue into your role
ok, still nice, I guess people on my discord will be unpatient to be able to do that :p
that's really cool
you guys dont randomly do teams at all? only captains?
or mmr based teams
only captains pick yeah, just sometimes captains are afk and we cant do anything
I mean not sure if they can reset the queue themself by voting if no admins are there
nah we don't used any mmr
the mmr helps to create fair teams
we would just use a simple Team 1 vs Team 2 with roles, once it's ready, it starts, and count as a game
since it balances based on previous wins and losses
yeah, but the problem is, people don't vote
also, if you are afraid of people being AFK, you could make the voicechannel required to join
since it kicks AFK people
if I have like 20 games a day for example, I can have people complaining about others voting for the wrong teams to get the points and I would have tons of report. It's just in case. that's why I avoid this
but they don't even vote at all
even if teams aren't fair, that's not an issue
idk, to me it seems unlikely people would vote wrong
if theyre doing it on purpose, just ban them or something lol
most of them comes from iosoccer, there's no mmr or things like that, people don't really take a look at it, they just got their own in game stats, the rest are Leagues with winning points or simple tournaments
I would use it tho, but I would have to put rules, ask a screenshot to everyone all the time to be sure the wins are correct.
unless Prosocceronline had a scoreboard in game
I could take a look
I mean no offense, your mmr work is awesome
btw again, you cant incorrectly vote a game unless someone on the winning team is trolling the vote
by default of course
Yeah, it's just having someone in the opposite team who needs to vote for the other winning team. From now on people don't even vote, I have to do everything manually
community is growing
they like the bot
its easy to get games and well organized
i should add a thing to DM the players every like hour to vote for the game
if its not voted for
Not sure if it's necessary tbf, maybe for csgo dota or valorant discord. Like I said, people just want to have games to be ready and play. Total games played leaderboard is enough. this is how it worked on iosoccer at least.
the rest is based on ratings in game, with in game statistics
passing, goals, interceptions, etc ...
on iosoccer, they also don't have to vote, and if it would be the case, would be a disaster with almost 500 players
every stats in game are related on a hub website
wins/lose etc ..
I hope prosocceronline will have the same success, but if I got tons of players, will be a tuff admin work to watch every games
so you would rather have no vote message, and just count a game for every player in the queue right
Yes, once both team are full, it says match ready ! and count as a game played
btw, is the command /addplayer an admin command ?
or will people be able to add their friend ?
in queue
no its only admin
asking because players on my discord asked me if they could do that. Old iosoccer habits again
you could add a player with a command thats why, but if you rather not add it, its ok
yea i feel like that is easy to abuse
also an AFK problem
yeah if people were purposely unsigning others and abuse the command they were warned or kicked from the matchmaking
so there was never really any abuse tho
rarely
but its fine like this
alright <@!297040314898841601> , i added /voteforresult which should do what you want
set it to FALSE to disable the winner message popping up
all players are given +1 to their total games
epic, that's nice
voice channels are deleted after they are empty, or after 2 hours
is there like a time before it get updated ?
the total games?
Nah I mean
your features in general
once you make the announcement
oh the commands take an hour to register
with discord
alright
i can manually set it for you if you want
command is available now
Hello, does it take some time for the game to appear on the leaderboard ?
I used the command to disable mmr, people can still vote but I guess it shouldn't take it count since I don't get any message to vote for team 1 and team 2 in queue management
but Not sure it does save the numbers of games played
no the games appear instantly
looks like there was an issue updating everyone for that last game
yeah stats are getting stuck atm
completely?
yeah
total games leaderboard is stuck
yea somehow someone doesn't have a totalgames counter in their stats, probably an issue with when I added it
looking for the culprit rn
<@!297040314898841601> try now
<@!145305657237700608> dont have a game running from now on. I tried with a 1v1 queue, with a friend
but didn't seem to work
it didn't even add him in the leaderboard
the leaderboard doesnt show up?
or its missing someone
its missing someone + doesn't count for me
wait I got a queue filled
gonna check
nah still the same
so its just missing someone
but other people's are fine right
ahh i think it should be fixed, i was initializing new players wrong so it wasnt counting them/showing them
wait maybe not hold on
ok NOW its working it looks <@!297040314898841601>
might take another game for it to show though
ok i'll take a look when I got one
btw, just to have an idea, not sur if you are working on it right now, I don't want to give you the feeling I pressure you, but do you have a date of the team 1 vs team 2 feature ?
if you are working on it ofc
not sure, havent touched it yet since im supposed to be working lol, ill look into starting soon tho
No problem
just starting to get issues with people who wants to play with their team, but I just have a captain mod atm so
but I don't see any options to make a mix vs team signing, until this feature
yea theres nothing for joining as a team rn
yeah I mean right now it wouldn't be a problem, just need like a Team 1 button and Team 2 button, with custom roles for both. anyway, let me know when you got something üòâ
ill try and throw something together rn
<@!145305657237700608> Sorry to bother you again, but still not counting :/, do you think it might have bugged the whole thing and need to reset ?
hope not but
not counting you, or everyone?
or a specific person again
everyone
in my 5vs5 channel
I did /voteforresult FALSE, its correct right ?
yea thats right, hmmm
queue into teams is almost done btw
üëå perfecto
theres no "vote" message showing up right
ok i think i got it hopefully
also i think the queue into teams is working, im sure theres bugs with it though
we are picking players
will tell you in a sec
didnt update yet
one sec
Oh ok
next game maybe then
still stuck :/
I didn't try
the game with the new queue
so I don't know if the last game was with the update or not
it wasnt
so someone is missing, or wrong numbers
i realized before it was only paying out 1 team
but now that shouldnt be an issue
Gonna hop in bed, thanks for your work  <@!145305657237700608> I'll tell you if there's any problem tomorrow, if people sign fast the same role and if it bugs everything
thx for your time üëç
i think i have a solution for if people try to join as the same role, but hard to test myself lol
its all almost there!
All good then if theres a solution :p
Hello! I'm currently trying to use the bot but unfortunately every time I'm trying to add a Queue name it's giving me this
give it another try now!
awesome thank you it works now but I can't seem to specifcy the queue size!
Essentially I wanna use this in a community where players will be queuing as 3 but it's for a game that's currently under development and that doesn't have a queue of its own üòõ
should be /teamsize
i think i forgot to update the /startqueue Custom help message üòÖ
Basically I want players to queue up if they're free and once a team of 3 is created the queue closes but I wanna create multiple queues if possible
is it 3v0, or something else?
or 3v3 you mean
It's 3v0 yea
It's not a compeititve 3v3 it's a scenario. Imagine LFG type
so for just a single team queue you can use /numberofteams 1
a okay
doesnt have alot of the features since you arent queueing against another team
okay so the  way I see it I just have to create Channel 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 and players just queue up in that channel right?
yea if you want multiple queues being filled at the same time, otherwise if you use a single channel players just join that one
but once the queue fills, people can join again
ah okay gotcha!
one channel is usually enough, unless you have a ton of people trying to queue at once
For now we only have like 15 - 20 but we might have a time where we'll have thousands trying so I might need to find something for then xD
makes sense, what game is it btw?
hello
hello
<@145305657237700608> thank you for all the active support man. And updates
Hi <@!145305657237700608> with /addplayer, can I add something I can type, not a player ?
no prob and thanks!
not rn at least, it needs to be a member in your discord
what are you trying to do?
this is the case I explained you the other day
I can't launch the queue
ahh gotcha, forgot about that
because someone is missing
i guess you could add <@!857633321064595466> lol
I can play singlekeeper
for now at least
but I would like also to give the choice to people if i'm not here
to start the queue with a singlekeeper
or vote to add neatqueue in
with the pos
ill try and add something to resolve that later, not sure what yet
yeah no problem
from now I can do it myself
how do I add neatqueue to team2 and GK pos ?
but use <@!857633321064595466>
if the queue didnt autostart from that, just leave and rejoin
no DMS and doesn't launch
yikes
oh ok
yea leave and rejoin
someone
didn't see
addplayer is kinda hacky lol it doesnt follow the same flow
ok all good
every command that I try to use give me that
did you /startqueue before?
I made it
a friend are helping me rn
now it's working
can I change the Team name?
nice glad to hear
yea, /teamsize
<@!145305657237700608> what about the order of roles?
can I change it?
i wanted to make it like in the order that i wrote
it should just be the same order in /roles
yeah actually it worked yesterday
but it changed
dont know why
the order changed on you?
also <@!297040314898841601> just added 2 new commands, /forcestart and /forcestartsize
forcestartsize lets you set the minimum number of players to forcestart
forcestart starts the game and can be used by anyone
yeah it changed
strange, gonna have to look into it
cant seem to reproduce it
idk why
but now it's in order
but i didn't understood how to change the team name
I want to make it like
Red Team and Blue Team
you cant do that unfortunately
ok so I can forcestart at 9/10 if a gk is missing
yup, or anyone can
nice
cheers
i made it not a mod command, since the mod can set the minimum size
or disable it
thx mate
looks like it already appeared
idk how it was that fast
yo <@!145305657237700608>, someone from told me they didn't receive DMS
yeah I tested in my queue test channel
seems its broken
what channel did it not work in
every channel I think. I made 2 5vs5 channel, one with captains pick mode, and another with teams selections and pos
I put the same title queue so it saves the countgames for both channel
maybe it's the reason why it does not work ?
each queue needs its own dm message
did you set it for each one
i'll try
yea thats why, its only set in 1 of your channels
yeah my bad I think
when I modified both I think it did reset it
no worries, just remember that queue channels are completely seperate except for stats
well, I have the same leaderboards for my 2 differents 5vs5 channel
If I put the same queue title I got the same leaderboard
yea, the stats are shared with name
but everything else isnt
except for the modchannel too
ah yeah
it's possible to make people can't choose a team?
Only choose the role?
bc people are doing stronger teams
propositally
just do /queueintoteams false
but it stills make teams?
but randomly
right?
you can choose how you want teams to be made
balanced, captains, random, unfair
how?
sorry
just turn off queueintoteams
how to use forcestart?
forcestartsize
<@!145305657237700608> hi mate, is the bot down ?
damn this server host, cant connect so IDK lol
1 sec
yikes
restart looks like it works? lmk
ok fixed
thx mate
might have to upgrade to better host, who knows
super unreliable the past 2 days
how does one reset the leaderboard?
you can do /resetdata to delete all players from your server, or change the queue name to use a different leaderboard
i could add a thing to reset all the stats for the current queue though if that seems helpful
i guess what matters if why you want to reset it
we're having a new 'season' every month, so changing queue name would probs work for us. is there a way to view a leaderboard for a given queue name?
for historical purposes
not currently, it would be saved with the old queue name
i‚Äôd be interested in adding that though, sounds cool
<@!145305657237700608> Yo mate, I got a question, do you think it's possible to change a queue name but keep the same leaderboard ?
if not then it's not a problem but wanted to know
i could add a thing for that, if you want i can manually do it in the meantime
nah no trouble, can wait for it : )
<@!369948469986852874> <@!297040314898841601>
i think i covered what you guys wanted
I will test it <@!145305657237700608>
got also another question
people are asking if there's possibility to configure the bot to pick randomly a captain. To avoid votes all the time
like skipping the option to chose Balanced, Captains, Random, Unfair
or skipping how the captains are picked
or both
both, preconfigured I guess
once its full, it choose directly 2 captains
randomly
btw thx for the renaming queue
perfect
np, i wanna think of a better way of configuring all this stuff than just a bunch of commands
since it gets confusing
Created this flowchart to help visualize with the config and how it impacts the queue
does it explain how to configure the bot for no vote ?
yea voteforresults is near the bottom
yeah I mean launch the queue without voting for for captain and random captain. Voteforresult is just for the mmr right ?
yea, i didnt add that option yet actually
alright
you guys never do random teams or anything?
no, because they are affraid of being unbalanced
you can reshuffle
yeah well we kinda vote always for captains so
hey is there anyway for me to rename teams in a queue
unfortunately not currently
what about in pic above the teams have a different name
Its always Team 1, Team2, Team3, etc
cant change that for now
well that sucks
theres been some previous interest, ill look into adding support
ive got another question when i use the addplayer command i dont see all the users on my server
you have to start typing the desired name and itll pop up
oh thought all the users will pop up
not sure why it doesnt, but thats a discord thing
is there a way i can set it to display a message when a queue is filled up
for voicechannelmode disabled right?
yeah
just added a message, probably should have one always
its there by default for voicechannels
so how do i set a custom message
what would you want it to say?
im using this for hades star queues so something along the lines of RS6 ready! (ping) meet where?
itll look like this by default
not decided yet would just like it to be customisable
if you want to have people meet up somewhere, i would use voice channels
its not a long process just a few lines will resolve the location
so there's no way for me to customize this myself
not rn
i guess i could add it if its that important
No dont worry about it if it becomes urgent I'll figure out something
hey! how do i change the prefix
also, when i forcestart a game, no dialogue or team selection pops up.
hi! you can‚Äôt change the prefix since it‚Äôs a discord slash command, different than the old commands
<@302105910128541696> looks like the bot is missing permissions in your channel, my next update should try to help debug this for users
no problem. fixed it. Another quesiton though, how do i skip the voice channel queue system and go straight to picking teams
./voicechannelmode optional or disabled
optional will make the channels but not wait for people
disabled does what it sounds like
nice! thanks
and i have to do this for every queue i start?
every channel, yes
queues are always running after you start though
its not like you have to /startqueue after each game
sorry for all of the questions, but when i do /voteforresult false, the voting menu still pops up
voteforresult impacts the voting for the winner at the end
ohhhhh
if you dont want the team picking thing, do /skipteamsetup
itll automatically create teams using MMR
ok so what percentage of votes do i need for the actual team picking to start
to choose captains
for example i have 6 players in the queue, how many votes do i need
by default its gonna be majority
you can change it to half with /requiredvotes
cool i got it working. so since i wanna end my queues and restart them at different times, is there a way to have preset settings? similar to how it gives you an option of rocket league, CSGO, etc?
why would you want to restart them?
my server isnt strictly gaming, and when a queue is running it stays at the bottom of chat (which is a great feature btw), but when people are just chatting it gets in the way
the best approach that most people do is dedicate a new channel to queues
since it does spam a chat quite a bit
but otherwise, no, theres no way to save presets of your own
ok. thanks for the info and tips
np üôÇ
also just so you know, the description for this command is incorrect i think
oh lol, good catch
is there a way to change the draft type from snake?
no, id be down to add that though
like a back and forth draft right
yeah like a 1111 rather than a 1221
alright i just added it
./drafttype
should appear in about an hour in your server
ohhh nice
is there a way to choose caps manually?
choose captains?
nvm i see the 2 most voted option
yup exactly
<@!302105910128541696> looks like my straight draft type isnt working right
Hello! :)
hey :3
hello people
hello creator :D
hey! for the queue to team option, theres no option to say whether or not its for mmr
true, it‚Äôs gonna always be on for that mode
since the option to turn it off is when you are creating teams
gonna have to add an extra voting thing maybe
thanks
i appreciate it !
planning to add a command to disable all mmr too probably
adding a voting menu just for enabling/disabling mmr seems a bit strange
nah i feel like its in a good spot tbh
i like that everyone has the ability to change the settings as they feel
yea true
do i need to have a queue filled to have voting for captains? i'm trying to test it in my private server before i implement it in a main server
is there a way to make it so only certain roles can use the bot in the channel? I'm trying to have different queues for low elo and high elo players. I'm trying to have it so that only high elo people can join the high elo queue and low elo can join the low elo queue
a queue needs to be filled yes, also it needs more than 2 people i believe
since creating teams with less than 3 people doesnt make sense really
not currently, you can make mmr requirements for the queue but that requires you to manually set MMR at the beginning. Best advice would be to lock the channels by role
id be interested in adding a default MMR per roles perhaps, that seems cool
What command do I use to have a minimum mmr to queue for a specific queue
/mmrrequirement mmr:
by default everyone starts at 1000 mmr
I have 2 different queues in 2 different channels for like different league ranks
So do I have to set everyone‚Äôs mmr manually for each queue
Or is the mmr for the whole server centralized
if the queues have different names, then yes you have to set mmr for each queue
all stats are tied to the queue name
but if they had the same queuename, the stats would be shared
Thanks <:crystLove:901215939117318214>
hey, so you said in order to run the same queue in multiple channels, i just use the same name right?
yup! as long as the queues have the same name, the stats will be shared
does clearqueue reset the current queue in the teampicking stage?
its not going to interrupt the queue if thats what youre saying
itll empty the queue, but after picking teams itll do the same
might be a little buggy doing that actually
i'm getting a "this interaction failed" when i'm trying to rejoin the queue
i made a league of legends queue
and i set the mmr requirement to 1000
i have not changed anyone's mmr so everyone should have 1000
ohhh i see
what sec
one sec*
try now <@!139333331929006080>
thanks
i just noticed you added the role requirements thing also
thanks for doing that makes my life way easier <:crystLove:901215939117318214>
no prob
havent tested much lol
is it possible to have it so that as long as a person has at least one of the required roles they can join the queue?
like i can set it so that mods/admins can join any queue
not rn, cant mods/admins just have that role too?
they can, i'm just wondering if theres a way. thanks for helping <:crystLove:901215939117318214>
What is the prefix?
all commands are through the / menu
just type /
Few quick questions first does this bot let you select your own team 1 by 1 so for example you are playing a 3v3 and team 1 picks then team 2 picks and back and forth.  Also can you set roles when a user get a certain amount of elo for example when they hit 100 elo the get a role called diamond.
Im just looking to set up a elo bot for rainbow six 5v5 where 10 people join a que and then 2 team captains gets randomly selected then they choose 1 by 1 their team then they go into a custom game and play the game then report score if anyone could help it would be greatly apricated
yes! thats the captain selection mode. By default its a snake draft, but you can make it straight with /drafttype
thats pretty much exactly what my bot can do
try it out in <#915810764277817354>
to see the functionality (by default)
Perfect thank you I didnt look much into it yet I just wanted to make sure thank you.
One last thing what is the command to set an amount of elo to assign a role?
currently theres no command for that, you can assign MMR based on role, but not the other way around
you can however make queues that required a role, or require some MMR to join
so instead of assigning roles, just make the /mmrrequirement higher
Is it possible to allow players to queue for multiple roles? Then once theres some combination that works it makes the game?
<@145305657237700608>
not currently, unfortunately <@!119197500417507328>
Ok damn
hey i have a bug to report. when you revert a game through the mod channel, the members of the team who were originally awarded a win receive an extra loss on their record
sounds like a dumb mistake on my end lol, not home today but i‚Äôll try and get around to it tomorrow üôÇ
is it possible to have people queue up for a game, and when it fills up they can then choose their team after?
people in the discord i use the bot in find it kind of confusing to do the whole draft thing with the bot so they do it manually in a voice channel
a mod in our discord said that most of the players only have phones to use
so its kinda hard
or maybe is it possible to have like a discord mod add people to teams after a queue is full so that mmr can be tracked?
Good morning
Can anyone help me set NeatQueue  ?
you can let people pick their team when they enter the queue, but otherwise you can‚Äôt manually pick your team after that
might be interesting to add a 5th team selection option that lets players join their own team
sure, what‚Äôs up?
finally got around to fixing this one
<@!145305657237700608> We are trying to set up NeatQueue in another server but the bot doesn't get past this part. It is making channels but the message box doesn't update to pick teams. Any suggestions?
yup! I just saw this, but the bot is missing Manage Channels permissions
the bot is supposed to tell you that, but its not for some reason
i think its a Category override
just made an update, hopefully you see an error now
<@!345719191141220354>
We were just double checking looking through all the permissions
saw that one of the manage channels ones was missing but trying again
looks like its the same issue, make sure that there's no override blocking it:
- Role permissions
- Category permissions
- Channel permissions
i can make an update a bit later to help identify where the issue is, but for now itll just tell you theres  an issue
Hmm, been trouble shooting some more and everything appears to be the same as the perms in my server, but my server gets to the next step but not in this one
Are you available to try joining our server to troubleshoot? We are gonna try kicking and re-inviting the bot in the meantime
<@!145305657237700608> ^
i can probably later tonight, not now unfortunately
but yea, the error is still with permissions somewhere, not quite sure where from though since normally it sends an error in chat
Ok, fwiw, I just tried doing the /stats command and was getting "This interaction falied" from discord
we were getting that error when trying to join the queue sometimes but it still let us in the queue so we didnt really think anything of it
Could also be just cause no one has played matches yet
We made it admin and it worked, but not quite sure thats a permanent solution for this server
makes sense since admin just has overwrites for all permissions
i think the interaction fails might be from permissions too, not quite sure, gonna have to check it out
Yeah, I think we will leave it as it is for now, but it would be awesome if you could help out later
for sure, i‚Äôll let you know when i‚Äôm free
hey, for some reason i cant find the "forcestart" command
didn‚Äôt think people used it lol, i disabled it to make room for other commands
you use it?
yeah
sorry, will add it back later
is there a way to sub a player out for another player once a queue has 6/6 players and voting starts?
or even after teams are formed and voted on
no not currently, usually though if you leave the queue during setup it‚Äôll cancel
but not with the temporary new channels no
cool.
also can you send the formula for the mmr calulation again?
it‚Äôs actually in <#919340161286946826> now
ohh cool
thanks bruh
how do i change the mmr of someone whos no longer in the server?
hmm, i guess technically you can‚Äôt right now
since it needs the user as input
How do I fix this?
The bot's role has Manage channel perms.
make sure that there‚Äôs no override somewhere that‚Äôs overwriting the permissions
like the category, or the role, etc
<@!145305657237700608> I can't add the bot, it says I need contact the dev to acess dis.gd/bot-verification and autorize so I can connect to my server
uh oh, that‚Äôs weird, i gotta check it out
<@!217717573406425088> found the issue, should be good to go
<@!145305657237700608> ty, is working now
Tested the bot in a new vanila discord server (default settings), the /startqueue doesn't work. I'm doing something wrong? When I invite the bot I gave the permissions.
when you type /startqueue, you should see a little pop up from NeatQueue
make sure it is selected
hey. is there an issue with the bot rn? or is it something on my end?
when i type in "/" none of the commands pop up anymore
<@145305657237700608> my issue is similar to the xander atm, when I write / I don't see the popup neatqueue commands
Oh, seems like the commands got unregistered
should be back within the hour
back now
is there a command that gives a temporary role to people in the current queue in session?
no, but curious what the use case would be
<@!145305657237700608> can you check if DM's are working? I tried to set a message and after the queue only tagged people
yea definitely broken, i‚Äôll check it out
<@!217717573406425088> its fixed now
Just to make it easier to ping them multiple times for team selection
The one ping from the bot sometimes isn't enough
hmm yea that makes sense
i wonder how a ‚Äúping‚Äù button on the message would help
maybe that‚Äôs an idea
One of my friends deleted the channel with the queue by accident, and the whole leaderboard is gone, is there a way to retrieve it?
just create a new channel and name the queue the same
you can use /queues to see the previous queues, and the number of players with stats
is it possible to remove that the created voice rooms are not "private" and limited? <@!145305657237700608>
or is this something static created by the bot?
maybe it's not customizable
so you want the voice channels to be public and without a limit?
yeah exactly
the ones that are created for team1 and team2
not currently, didn‚Äôt think that there would be any use in that
hmm ok, and I dont see anyway to create a role that can bypass the private channel/limit
unless you dont assign the user an admin role, correct?
correct, there‚Äôs no way to override that
how come you want to change the limit?
I want everyone to be able to join the team1, team2 and queue room
i guess it makes more sense to restrict it but people from team1 and team2 want to talk and spectators want to join the rooms etc and listen
i can probably add a config for that if you really want it
it would be awesome to have it üòÑ
unless there is a role I can autoassign everyone to bypass it
./channelrestrictions disabled should get you what you want üôÇ
do i need to restart something for it to work?
nope, should be good to go
thanks alot!
<@!145305657237700608> whats the different between the draft options snake/straight?
I can see that snake is 1-1-1-1-1
straight is 1-1-1-1, snake is 1-2-2-1
both are common draft types if you look them up
How can i add many maps with only one command?
you need to use /map add
map add map_name:chalet map_name: Villa;; like this (?)
just one at a time
./map add chalet
./map add Villa
etc
how can i avoid doing it every time i make a Q
Queues are always running, so the maps will stay
until you /endqueue
after every game, the queue resets, and players can rejoin
all settings remain
okokok ty
np üôÇ
<@!857633321064595466> channelrestrictions doesn't work
the rooms are still private and limited
when I set it to disabled
hmm i just tried and it was fine, are you sure that it was set to disabled? It mightve gotten reset
yeah
it was disabled
give it one more try to make sure, if its still broken send me a screenshot üôÇ
i just copied your settings and it worked for me
alright
Is there a way in which I can stop the bot from creating voice channels when the queue is full? <@&922916141221961749>
if you do /voicechannels disabled it wont create any voice channels üôÇ
Says it‚Äôs an invalid choice?
<@145305657237700608>
what do you see?
just tap disabled up above
I did
And I tried to send it but it doesn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶
Huh, it says that on Mobile but not on PC
strange
Ah right
So I‚Äôve to be on my pc then
Rip but fairs
Thanks
it shouldnt be an issue
mobile should be fine, not sure why its not
seems like its out of my control? not totally sure...
Fairs no worries
Also when the queue pops does the bot automatically ask if we want to do captains or randoms etc.?
yup! as long as your queue has more than 2 people as the max size
and you didnt do /skipteamsetup
Perfect thanks
Is it possible to put an unlimited amount of time for the voting?
not currently, i can add that though
well, maybe
it takes up resources waiting so i have to think
what is "The application did not respond"?
could be a few reasons, either the bot had an error on its side, or it just took too long processing the request you made and didn‚Äôt respond in time
if the command worked you can ignore it
When a series gets voted on, the bot has not put people back in the default channel a couple of times today
it's inconsistent though
super strange, ill check it out
the host is fucked, whenever i sign in, i sign in as you <@!145305657237700608>
and I can control the bot from any server you're in
i accidentally started Q in general cus i was like wtf?
yikes
disabled interaction with the bot for now from the web
how did i manage that...
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
is it possible to manually select players to their team? i run valorant customs and we use the inbuilt valorant autobalance to make teams
you can use /queueintoteams and itll look like <#915812487826382930>
ah okay
i was thinking of adding a new team selection method of just letting players choose though
since with /queueintoteams you need to join the valorant game first, then enter the queue right?
which isnt great
i mainly use the bot for slot reservation and vc creation
since theres so many ppl that want to play and its hard to keep track who joins first
but yeah i completely forgot /queueintoteams was a feature
no worries üôÇ
<@!585191942728581128> Ok, the website should be fixed
<@!145305657237700608> this new feature you implemented, can you increase the time to join team 1 and team 2?
i'm not exactly sure where to change that if possible
i can bump it to 60 seconds if that works?
Put it to 60 seconds, also theres a command /menutimer (should appear soon) which controls the countdowns for all menus
ok ty
hi, the bot doesn't respond to /setup or /startqueue
and neatqueue.com dashboard displays blank page when I select server to manage
<@!177867339948097536> <@456226577798135808> is that still happening?
I was asleep but looks like everything is fine, so maybe the bot went down?
not responding to either /Setup or /startqueue
could you send a screenshot?
sure
the bot's online
when you type a command, make sure it pops up and you select it
are you doing that?
<@!145305657237700608> there's no such command popping up for me
ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
ye I don't get any popup
my bad i understand, theyre coming back
also I <@456226577798135808> noticed an issue with the balance by roles thing if you noticed
Havent used it after cap increase
Alright hopefully no one noticed
also is the website fine still? That wouldve been unrelated
for me website was borked
cant check atm
<@!145305657237700608> would it be possible for you to open up the stats api a bit and let's say have option to plug stats to 3rd party database :D
im down for that, bot doesnt even have any stats api yet but that would be sick
ah cool
ill have to add an API token system on the website that links your key to your discord account, but shouldnt be too bad overall
ye would be cool
<@!145305657237700608> Hey, was wondering, so, how I have it setup, is there is a Que chat, where people can join que, a Chat that is linked to Que chat where people can do the commands, and I have a waiting room call, that people has to be in. now, when que is full, I have it to auto set teams, does it auto make a call, and drag them into it, or what does it do, since I would like to know how it works before I announce it.
so does it make 2 calls and drag 5 to each call?
When the queue fills, it will create a voice channel and prompt everyone to join. If you have a /defaultchannel itll drag players from there. Once everyone joins, it will create 2 Team channels and automatically move players to their respective channels
usually theres a team picking phase, but if you have it skipped it creates team fairly using the MMR
nice, thanks for quick response, now does it create the calls in the same category as the que chat, that is a bit important for me, as my server is used for more then just 10 mans, and how would I go to setup map bans other then doing it manually
yup same category, itll go right to the bottom of it
also theres no map bans, but if you have maps set then players can vote for the map
how would I set up map votes
you can use /map add
if you add any maps, itll auto show the voting menu
perfect, thank you for the amazing support
no prob!
done
<@!185860681537421312> i see you guys have something weird
can you screenshot your queue message
Not sure if this is what you were looking for? (Btw, you're amazing!)
thanks lol, i updated the ./lobbydetails command which required changing the data for every queue, and i think you guys started a queue mid update so thats why it broke?
i would just ./clearqueue and delete any channels it created an run it back
Interesting. I'll try thanks!
oh you cant lol
its complaining about something with the old queue message (the message with the Join/Leave buttons)
clearqueue will give you a brand new message though
We will give it a try to reset after the game
Thanks!
The bots commands have me a little confused I wish to make a channel tat automatically puts players in their respective vc after captain selection
that*
thats what happens by default actually
unless you ./voicechannels disabled, it will auto drag players
is it only for me the new command is not recognized by the bot?
give it another try, mightve been registering still
ill try
new commands take some time
ah okay I tried doing /startqueue PUG's teamsize: 6 numberofteams: 2
that should be just fine
okay thx üòÑ I just dont really have someone to test it on atm and was very confused if that worked
no worries! Thats the same config as <#915810764277817354> (besides the team size), so you can test it out there if you want
I also have one more question about the mmr what I understand its like sr from overwatch
but how exactly does it work
yup, similar to overwatch and any ranked game for that matter
Everyone starts at 1000 MMR by default (/startingmmr), with an average MMR change per game of 50 (/mmrchange)
The MMR calculations come from https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/919340161286946826/923282716814868510
does everyone automatically receive this rating? or do people have to register for it and put their loses?
After teams are made you will see this message
Its majority votes
is their a way to make it so one person chooses?
after you vote, the results are shown
You can make it either majority or half the total players required
I can add a single vote option if that would be helpful, but for the most part majority works
Theres also a /resultschannel that will let the Admin choose the winner
okay thank you very much üòÑ
üëç  really like this bot so far keep up the good work!
np! thanks!
Hi, is it possible to cancel a game (perhaps as setting it as a draw?)
./selectwinner queuenum 0
set the winning team as team 0
it will cancel it
actually, you might have to pick a winner
and then ./selectwinner to revert it
cant confirm off the top of my head
Will give it a try next time! We have a reoccuring issue with people not clicking the right things üòâ
unlucky lol
Is there a video explaining like step by step how to set up this bot?>
there should be but i haven‚Äôt made one
can you give the link
i cant find it
but does it delete the queue channels after everyone has left?
yup, it deletes after you vote for winners or the channel is empty
ok but if im i am creating queue for a game that u cannot win like sea of thieves then?
you can disable voting with /voteforresult
ok thx
haven‚Äôt used it in a while but hopefully it‚Äôs still working lmao
im testing it
will report if doesnt
the vc got deleted but what about the text channel
do you have /setupchannel enabled
i would turn it off and try again, i added voteforresult way before the setupchannels
i‚Äôll have to update it
Can anyone hop in a call and help me set it up
<@!145305657237700608>
i‚Äôm not free for a few hours, just run /startqueue
or use the web dashboard
don‚Äôt use /setup, i broke it earlier
ohh gotcha thankyou
<@!145305657237700608> We have a full 6 man queue but we are stuck on the screen after we picked teams
sorry for the questions lol
yup that‚Äôs my bad
forgot to update the default queue settings with my update
so is it down for now?
give it another try in 3 mins
do we need to requeue
someone‚Äôs gonna need to leave yeah
should be able to try it now hopefully
no don‚Äôt end queue lmao
it‚Äôs an issue with the default settings
run /bestof 1 to fix it
it just started another queue
hmmm
could you hop in our server and check it out
it‚Äôs an easy fix on my end but i‚Äôm in class lmao
one sec
you good lol
if you /clearqueue and /bestof it‚Äôll fix
or you can wait for me to fix
we are trying nothings working. Just lmk when you get a chance to help us.
it works now
just start your queue and you‚Äôre good
appreciate the help man üëç
no prob, sorry you guys had that issue
So I renamed the queue and then updated it and didnt realize it would clear the MMR. Is there a way to retrieve the old leaderboard and update the new one or is it just a lost cause?
all stats are tied to the queue name, so if you change the name back with /queuename you will get the stats back too
check all the queue names you have stats for with /queues
if you want to rename the queue AND keep stats, do /rename, otherwise just do /queuename
Oh awesome, thanks for the quick response!
Im still having a issue with having a queue started after a match has already started
if that makes sense
not too sure what you mean
can invite me if you want or send screenshots
sorry I am really bad at explaining things.
Ill get back to you in a sec im still in my lecture lmao
thank you though
Is there anyway to make it to where the bot automatically selects a random map from the map pool for the players to play and the players don't have to vote on random?
currently it is only via selection
Hmm - is there anyway to make it where all of the map selections don‚Äôt show up and only random shows?  (Sorry to pester)
gonna have to be the same answer unfortunately, maps only work with the voting for now
Is there a way to only have one queue at a time? like if one game is going on then the queue wont start till after the game is done
you can limit players from being in multiple queues at the same time, but otherwise you cant stop a queue from starting after the other finished creation
can we have ranking for different channels or queues?
yup, all stats are tied to the queuename, so just call them something different
Hey could you DM me? I have a question that is private for a discord server and a game. Thank you.
How do I activate the bot after its added to my server?
./startqueue or /setup
And which command removes the queue if I messed up?
./endqueue
or just use commands to edit it
Nvm I've got it.
What exactly is mmr? How can I make it where winner gets x amount of points and loser gets - x amount of points and everyone starts with 0 after they register the gamertag? Or user in the server?
If you type /help where the bot is responding it replies with a ton of commands. I‚Äôve used it many times it‚Äôs super useful and has a ton of info. üòÅ
you can set the starting mmr with /startingmmr and /mmrchange for the average mmr
yup thanks üôÇ
Took me a second to figure out /help as well once I found it, it made it really easy. üòÉ
Yeah, but what is mmr? It doesn't explain it
mmr is match making rating
it‚Äôs just a value for your ranking
So if I want it started at zero. Do I put zero?
And also what about reporting games. This is also not in the command list
check out <#915810764277817354> and see how the reporting works
it‚Äôs buttons
is there a way to make the settings locked? like everytime the queue gets full it's mmr captains 2 highest mmr captains
Can this bot automatically assign new members to roles?
currently you can only lock it to automatically create teams balanced, but you can‚Äôt automate the other options
no, you will need a reaction roles bot for that
is it possible to disable the rematch option?
not rn, i can add a toggle for it though
rematch requires everyone to agree, so it doesn‚Äôt impact much
if a game starts is there a way to end the current match so nobody gets the win or loss
can i also give another role admin perms to the bot
you can enable ties with /ties, or you can revert a game using the /resultschannel if you had it set, or /selectwinner 'game_num' 0
where 0 is team 0, which reverts the entire game creation
the bot checks if users who type commands have manage_channels perm, so you have to give that out
<@!145305657237700608> how do i disable the thing where you have to vote to join another queue
./multiqueue True
will disable the check
one of my guys cant ever join the queue but everyone else can
and ideas
is their discord up to date?
always the easy stuff lol thanks for all your help
my sever loves this bot so far
thanks! glad to hear üôÇ
thr game was already voted on and had a winner
set /multi queue to false
and i‚Äôll debug tomorrow
thanks!
didn't fix it
also queue #6617 having the same issue
your multi queue is set to false?
I did the commans
it says not
that's what it does when I do false
set to true
i‚Äôm dumb
lmfao
all good
it worked lol thanks man
can you show that 6616 was voted for already
just to make sure it‚Äôs actually a bug
like the game being completed
yea where it said the winner
this?
both thoes games players had the issues with queue up again
yea that‚Äôs it
damn definitely a bug
How to prevent interation failed
Queue message isn't updating
screenshot?
might have worded that wrong
players can queue and leave queue just fine, but it doesn't place the queue after every message anymore
hmmmmmmmmm
anything trigger it? or did it just stop updating
is there a feature to dm people in the current queue rn?
like a lobby password dm system
./lobbydetails
its in /help
with the keywords
nice. thanks
not working
and i don‚Äôt see it on the top.gg website
you have to vote for that game
I need the ability
to add a loss
without knowing their losses
like
./set losses @me +1
just check their losses with /stats or on the leaderboard
and increment it
like an add loss command
would make it a lot easier tbh
fair enough, i can add that
but for now you have to do my approach above ^^^
I need that
Like ASAP
I have a whole setup
and I am ready to have it all working together
but I can't remember / know their losses / wins
you really shouldnt have to manually adjust player stats very often
since there is easier ways to revert/change match outcomes
but if you do, you need to do my approach above for now
So basically
I am friends with <@!302105910128541696>
and he showed me this bot. I have my own server and it's going be used a shit ton
like his
maybe even more, not trying to sound cocky but like trust me it's going to be live af
but I really really need to be able to just /set losses me +1
well the record to beat is 1000 matches in a day üòõ
but i dont have time to add that tonight sorry
tomorrow, perhaps
IDK if I would beat it, but at the same time, I might just beat it
i believe in u
why do you feel you will need it alot?
because I can't
remmeber / do /stats
because I am using a bot
with my
c++ tool
unofficial  tourney tool
how come it is going to manually increment losses
just wonderijng
because thats how I
have it
It types shit like this
but I will
change it to type
to the bot
i dont totally understand how it integrates with neatqueue
OKay so
bot can type
./set losses name number
however
bot cannot remember original losses
therefor
bot needs to be able to
incriment by 1
without remembering the wins / losses already
does that
make snese
yea makes sense
just wondering what the use of that is
alright i added commands to increment stats
luckily it took 2 minutes
was like thinking why it would be hard
its not hard, but it adds more commands to the bot
more confusion
I forgot to
Thank you
its /add
I need someone to help me setup neatq
<@!145305657237700608>
sure what‚Äôs up
Wanna jump in a call?
Can you can run me through it?
sorry can‚Äôt right now, what do you need the bot to do
check out /help
I‚Äôll dm you what I need homie ahha
Unless you want it here?
dms is fine
<@!145305657237700608> lil grammatical error i found
yo, I need someone to help me setup neatq. Just wanted to know how can users create their owns queues without being admin ?
<@!145305657237700608>
when you create a queue, it is constantly running in that channel
so players don‚Äôt need to create their own, they join the one you created
yes i know but i wanted to know if they could do it by their own ?
because when the queue is over, i can't be there everytime
when the queue is over it resets, it doesn‚Äôt disappear
check out <#915810764277817354>
i created that queue once, and it has always been running
ok nice to know that
but the queue cannot be named differently each time ? And the one which is finished, stay like an historic or disappear to be replaced by the new one ?
not quite sure what you mean
after the queue end, it simply kicks all the players out
also all stats are tied to the queue name
ok thanks for ur time üòâ
Its me again lol ! Can one role be used to earn same points through multiples queues in differents channels ?
one role?
yeah i wanted to create 3 roles which in each players could play in 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, etc and if role 1 win in 2v2, then he wins in 3v3, points will continue to increase the same or they will be split in each queue ?
all stats are tied to the queue name, so winning in either queue (if they have the same name) will update their overall stats
holy i forgot that !
my bad lol
ty man sorry !
no prob
then i don't have to set each time their mmr at 0 to begin for each queue ?
because it is at 1000 by default
correct
can we setup MMR to not lose points for those who'll lose but only add points for winners ?
it‚Äôs a two way street for the most part since the winners gain the mmr that the loser lose
you can set an /mmrfloor which will determine the lowest you can go in terms of MMR
yeah
but it can't be just additionnal then ?
maybe in feature request
perhaps, not sure i see the benefit of it but you can explain it
i was just thinking on earning points without being MMR style and then without losing points for those who lose. In this way, losers are not frustrated and can try to earn points next time
gotcha, yea that shouldn‚Äôt be hard to add
it would be great üôÇ
When I make a queue using "/setup?" can that queue with those settings be called upon at any moment or do I have to customize a queue every time I make one?
My follow up question would be can I configure a lobby to queue a certain number of people and then split them into teams?
this is a common confusion, but once you create a queue it will never go away
when it fills up and teams are created, it is simply emptied and ready again
this is the default behavior right
Oh, so the queue always exists?
yea check out <#915810764277817354>
i created it months ago and it‚Äôs still allowing you to queue
Thank you so much!
no prob
I'm looking at <#915810764277817354> and I'm wondering what commands I can use to setup Team selection and Captain selection for my queue
thats the default
is the default done by just running the "/setup" command?
yup itll be the default unless you intentionally turn it off
Will try again then in the setup. Thank you for the prompt help! I really like this bot
glad to hear üôÇ
I have a question when you have Q and need 10 players to start a lobby and when i gonna set lobby number to 2 then i gonna need 20 players to start or just 10 and every body else just gonna stay in Q
Hey, MMR will be for users or can we setup it for discord roles like for exemples 3 discord roles which each one represents 1 village ?

Another question : if 2 discord roles are set with starting MMR at 0 points on a queue, and for the first game between two teams, when one of them lose, the winner will win points with MMR change even if each discord role had 0 points to begin ?
Thank you for ur future answer <@!145305657237700608> ^^
I've a got another issue with this screenshot to show you this => i've setup 0 starting MMR for 2 discord roles but when i check my stats i've 1000 whatever i did and i've the Kotsu role on the screenshot
maybe i've to start a game to turn my MMR into 0 ?
lobby number is a pretty specific setting i added for a server but it allows you to create multiple lobbies from a single filled queue
so if you had 12 people queue, it would split them up into a 3v3 and another 3v3
remove the everyone starting role
the bot picks the highest possible rating it can assign
how to remove it ?
mmr is per person, not per role. While the starting mmr might be the same, that is all
./startingmmr
ok it works ty ^^ but MMr per person cannot be replaced per roles then ?
nah there is no way to have stats shared between players
Soo for example i dont need to fill all slots for every role bcs only 2 players for every role need to joint to start a gama yes?
depends on what you are trying to achieve
if you want 5v5, then no this wouldn‚Äôt work
Ah ok
unless you want to wait for 20 people
and then split into 2 matches of 5v5
that is your current setup (i believe)
So I'm still struggling a bit with this setup. I'm trying to get this:
But I keep getting this with the default setup:
I've tried running "/startqueue" and "/setup" without configuring further settings on the latter command
do /voicechannels optional. something like that
I had the same issue
Oh thanks, I'll try that
yea, by default the bot waits for EVERYONE to join the voice channel before continuing with team setup
./setup in the advanced options prompts you with this config
Yep, that worked. Thanks for the help!
Lil question but is these info stay forever in a queue or must we setup it again and again after each queue ?
all data will persists UNTIL you run /endqueue, which deletes it from the database
is the bot down rn?
yes <#919709100114346076> , taking a bit more than 5 mins
gotcha sorry didn't see that üëç
should be fixed in a sec
why the Que makes in the lobby channels
not quite sure the question
i mean when you start the q and get the team bot create text channel
and then he create Q in that text channel
oh i see what you mean, the setup channel has its own queue inside of it
right?
yea not sure, that shouldnt be there
everyone is getting interaction failed when voting for a winner after the bot went down
is the match from before the bot went down
about 10 mins ago
yea i have same bug
hmmm
13512, 13517,13519 are the three that are stuck rn
what is your server id
can you fix mine as well ?
946040166064205854
so you can see the winner message, but clicking doesnt do anything?
they get errors
i think i found why, 1 sec
Its bad?
not sure lol
no not bad
still working on it
I would just delete the queues that are stuck and hopefully it is solved
im still trying to replicate it myself and I cant
So we need to create new queues ?
no, it wouldnt be an issue with the queue
i meant delete extra channels if they were created
There still bug with extra queues in voting/setup channels
every time?
wow i am an absolute baboon
ok i know why the winner vote thing wasnt working
updating now
is it still creating queues in the setup channel?
awesome, thanks
btw i found a new bug üòÖ
when you chose to get random team and want to re-samble them again than the magic happyn
the magic happens?
i mean than you have 10 people in one team when you should 5
do you have  an example of that?
not quite sure I know what you mean
not rly bcs i ban this option on my server
im confused on what the bug is then
when you chose random and try to roll team again
you get 1 person in both teams
oh it duplicates people?
do you have any example of that or nah
rn nope
i ban this option on my server
hmm it looks fine to me
guess I will leave it for now
btw, you're doing an awesome job and I really appreciate what you're doing
thanks üôÇ
Finally figured out the duplicate queue issue in new channels, should be resolved now !
yo idk if your still in my server but the bot stopped making its own text channels. its being super weird lol
Looks like Annexed ended the queue and restarted it which wiped your settings
need to /setupchannel enabled to get the new channels again
appreciate the help again üëç
hmmm lemme try that
it's happened to a couple people it sounds like
yup definitely happens
lemme see if its easy fix
shouldnt happen again, might be able to revert stats if you need
cool thanks for the quick fix
I do not want Winner For Queue to appear on this channel.
What should I do?
<@!145305657237700608>
do you want the vote to happen at all?
so you vote, but you don‚Äôt see the result?
Results can be seen but we don't want to put the contents of this yellow box on the Kew channel.
<@!145305657237700608>
Hi, can we look at the leaderboard MMR with the web dashboard ? <@!145305657237700608>
no sorry , there is no other way to see the results
currently planned but not possible yet, the dashboard is only for modifying queues
ty üòâ
What this command /drafttype type do ?
"Sets the draft type, either Snake or Straight" ? I don't get it ? <@!145305657237700608>
for captain selection, how the players are picked
snake draft or straight draft
it means than if theses players choose themselves their team interactively, this is not used ?
no, it represents how the draft will work
the team draft in captain mode
So it can be choosed a captain randomly in each team ?? And what is the difference between snake and straight draft ?
Sorry im not native english
https://www.rookieroad.com/football/fantasy/draft-types/
Automated draft is possible here ?
Hello good day 
We want to use Neatqueue for Valorant Pugs I want to know how can we make our own leaderboard
automated teams are created using the balanced mode, not captains
hi!, all stats are tied to the queue name , so anyone that plays a game in the queue will be on the /leaderboard
is the ranking system resets each month ?
nope, unless you want it to
how ?
./resetstats
or change the queue name, since all stats are tied to the name
cool thanks üòâ
why the command doesn't appear on /help ?
i might‚Äôve forgotten lol
np ^^
and last question, if we do reset all stats, we don't have to recreate all queues if the queue name stay the same, right ?
correct, all queues will remain
Hi, what does 2 lobbies do in that screenshot ?
queue size is 8, and it‚Äôll create two 2v2s
ok ty ! üòâ
i'm trying to set the queue at 1 lobby but it stills at 2 when i check with /info, is it normal ?
i would only 1 2v2
the command i use is /numberoflobbies
i haven‚Äôt had any issue with it
it should update the queue size immediately
mmhhh for me not
i have to restart all my configuration ?
shouldn‚Äôt have to
i've 18 channels configured with queue and so many options and i can't change number of lobby in all of these xD
you can invite me if you want me to check it out
sure
Hey question : is the MMR displayed in nicknames only displayed on queues or next to each discord names too ?
Depends how you setup
any option for rating in names will actually nickname the discord users
hey, for the "best of" voting, how do i set up the vote to look like the one in the example?
i want to have a vote between best of 6 and best of 9
hmm, well with /bestof there is an option for voting
however, if you input 9, it will show voting options 1,3,5,7, and 9
you cant choose the lower bound right now
How do you make it so the bot can be used in any channel?
<@&899113725120892968>
not sure the question
you can /startqueue in any channel
Hi <@!145305657237700608> i wanted to know if it was normal that the map name doesn't appear on finals results here :
yup, that‚Äôs normal
unless people want it added
Can it be added later?
It would be really appreciate and usefull
yea that wouldn‚Äôt be too hard to do
It is possible to block all others buttons "Join" in others channels for queueing if we're already joining one with the same queue name ?
<@!145305657237700608>
./multiqueue False will remove players from other queues/block people from joining queues if they are already in a game
excellent ty !
excuse me if i'm wrong but it stills doing the same lol
i've putted this command to false /multiqueue btw
and i still can joining few queues at same time <@!145305657237700608>
where can i see if the option is well saved ?
you can join multiple queues, but it‚Äôll remove you from the other queues when one fills up
oh ok !!!
i've tried in debug mode but still doing the same even if i fill up one queue is it normal ?
ok i think it is because of debug mode because when i try to left the second queue i've got this message :
Another question, is the "Show My Stats" button has a personal cooldown each time you use the button or it has a general cooldown for all users each time we use it ?
you have a match running? like one has the select winner buttons
individual cooldown
nope the first match was ended
but even if it wasn't, i was in the second queue
but i think its because of debug mode because it says that i wasn't really in
hmm, it removed you from the queue but seems the message was bugged
maybe i've to try in real condition and not in debug mode
there is no way to see if /multiqueue is in true or false with /info command ?
could be helpful to know each parameter with /info command
it should be, looks like i forgot to add it
whats the easiest way to reset everyone's mmr for a queue thats going to have the same name
either /resetstats ‚Äúname‚Äù or change the queue name
and pretend the stats are new
what was the command to remove mmr? or did you not end up adding that in?
subtract mmr*
you can use /set or /add
oh ok
i think this is a bug with the new feature btw
it says team 3 when there were only 2 teams in the queue
uhhhhh
thats strange
you sure you dont have 3 teams lmao
yeah. only 2 teams
btw i keep getting an interaction failed message when i try to revert a queue
which queue num?
we cannot use this command anymore ?
yea you weren‚Äôt really supposed to be able to, i‚Äôll add a test command probably
oh ok..
because when i wanted to fills up in solo it was really helpfull to test
hmm i‚Äôll add it back later today probs
thanks man
Queue#15835
btw, when i manually add people to a queue, their mmr is different from when they join on their own
vert is the only one who joined on his own, the others were added using the /player add
i see that, easy fix oops
it was using your mmr, instead of theirs
ohhhh i seee
and im still unable to revert any games. i can only change the result to tie
i see i see, one of the players in the match has weird stats which breaks it somehow, i‚Äôll figure it out
yeah the guy somehow has -4 losses üíÄ
And thanks
probs cuz its like updating half the people's stats, but since it cant finish it lets you do it again...
makes sense
lmk if you get around to fixing it
think i found it, you mustve tried /voteforresult False a few weeks back
i realize i forgot to update it to my new way of keeping track of previous games, so it gets confused and breaks
try it now
everything works. thanks!
hi
i have an annoying leaderboard issue

for some people on our server (especially for me) mmr is setting itself to 500 without admin's interference
also it shows me like 5 times in a single leaderboard for some reason

any chance of fixing it?
what is your server id?
950892446466863104
you have multiple queue channels, correct?
yeah, correct
most of them have the starting MMR set to 500
in the /info
but even after playing some games it still changes (for example) my mmr from 1.6k to 500 without a reason tbh
is it something that I'm doing wrong?
looks like your MMR is currently 1603, right?
yes, because I've set it manually for like 4th time today after it changed itself to 500 without me playing anything :\
also as you can see I'm being shown multiple times in single leaderboard, it's kinda weird
do you have multiple people with your name in the server?
assuming not, just making sure
there was an issue I fixed a few days ago with checking /stats of other users overriding your stats, so maybe thats why
people checked your stats, and it overwrote theirs
we've just started yesterday and it shown my nickname for basically everyone when they've typed /stats, so maybe that's it
hmm nevermind then, lemme see
right now it's showing correct names, but still changes MMR randomly for some players
looks like its messed up, the pictures aren't yours
so i think its overriding their stats with yours
or something
yeah, possibly that's the issue
is there anything we can do about leaderboard and the mmr changing itself then?
looking into it right now, ill let you know
okok, tysm ‚ù§Ô∏è
im about to run a command to fix your leaderboard, let me know if it works üòÑ
okay!
gotta wait for bot to start 1 sec
!nq fixlb 950892446466863104
Done
nope it broke it all i think
yeah, it did
1 sec
okok, you should see the old leaderboard
yeah, leaderboard is working again
it happened again just now
!nq fixlb 950892446466863104
Done
ok, the leaderboard should only have your name once
time to find this other issue
can you /save your queue and give me the code?
yesss, it works just fine right now, tysm!
ofc ofc
NBNUJ
did it happen after a match, or after checking stats?
i guess stats?
after checking stats
a couple of times yesterday and today totally randomly
like did it JUST happen, i fixed the bug last night
(one bug)
i guess it wasnt last night actually
right after you reset the bot for the first time few minutes ago
it changed MMR for one of the members to 500
did they use the command, or did someone check their stats?
he clicked 'show my stats' button and it showed that he has only 500
after you've reverted the leaderboard
im just not sure if his mmr JUST changed, or if he just realized it from his stats
from what I know he had his normal mmr today at 01:30AM CET
he did check it right now and it shows 500, so I don't know when it changed his mmr also
can you /set mmr for him, and recheck his stats?
ye ye
or you can invite me idc
I've just /set his mmr and it seems ok for now
If it will be easier for you I can send inv
if the issue exists still, it must not be from checking stats hmmm
is there any way to donate to you?
if you want lol
donate
we've just invited more people to the server and i think i know what's the issue

after setting MMR by running /set mmr [nick] [mmr] command it kinda breaks and shows me (or the other admin) multiple times in a leaderboard
also our mmr is breaking because of that so we have to set it manually once again
your mmr is breaking, so you need to keep using /set?
okay so you think /set is the root of the issue cuz it breaks stuff and you can‚Äôt use it to fix anything
ah i found it <@!282638047512756224> , you are setting the starting value for players manually i assume?
yes yes
because we have different starting mmr for different ranks
you can set different starting MMRs
but I should have a fix now
wouldnt recommend manually setting everyone's mmr, too much work
yeah i know, but I was not really looking into that option
fair enough, updating now and ill fix your leaderboard again
hopefully the last time üòÖ
you're an angel man
sorry its been so broke for u guys
npnp, it's a little bit problematic, but apart from that neatqueue bot is an awesome tool, we were looking for something like this for really long, awesome work dude
!nq fixlb 950892446466863104
Done
ok lets hope its smooth sailing
Yoo can we put with /ratinginname format, a space between name and ($) ?
can u give me an example?
Example: not like this NeatZ(1000) but like this : NeatZ (1000)
the bot adds the space automatically
cuz I dont think the command lets you add it
the space doesn't appear in any cases
i see that, lemme check
oh, the default had the space, not the command
ahhhh
is there a way to allow this space with the command ?
im just adding it by default
updating now
ty !
k should be good when the bot lets you type commands
give it a few mins
ok i'll try
we have to queue again to see the change ?
yea it only updates when you re-enter the queue
i've tried with /test command but nothing appear next to my name
you have the ratinginname enabled?
are you the server owner?
oh wait a minute
i just saw the space between name and MMR with /info command so i think it works
should be good, if you are the server owner the bot cant change your nickname
oh so owners can't have MMR next to their name ?
even if the bot is above them maybe ?
No matter what, the bot can't nickname the server owner
its a discord api limitation, idk why
cuz you cant make the bot higher permissions that the owner
i see
ty üòâ
the MMR even appear in the queue maybe if i disabled MMR on nicknames ?
repeat that?
confused
is the MMR appear next to us on the queue even if i disable MMR next to nicknames ?
it shouldnt
hm actually
so the only way to see our MMR is next to our nicknames or with Show My Stats button ?
or the leaderboard, yes
okok
because my problem is that owners are players too
you can move NeatQueue above every single role and it should be able to nickname everyone EXCEPT the actual server owner
there is only 1 person it cant nickname
theres a bug here im pretty sure
both teams randomly got a loss
even though no one voted
and both teams lost MMR
<@!145305657237700608>
was it at old game?
nah*
its our latest queue
hmmm i see
so you guys didnt do anything?
nahh
did someone vote tie in the results channel?
i realize the Tie option is broke, so maybe that
were u able to revert it at least
hopefully i fixed the issue
yeah i reverted it but im not sure it actually game the mmr back
guess you should be at like 1200 if it fixed
Hi just here to say that with /test command when i fill up a queue but i left 1 place to test with another person the queue do weird things
I think /test command works just for one guy isnt it ?
are you leaving /test enabled?
mmh idk why ?
/test has weird behavior
for testing
yeah i saw that sometimes
can we put an advertisement when /test is enabled ?
i can't see if i let /test command up lol
just do /test and itll tell you
yeah but if i forget for those who will play after lol
and another weird thing :
next to nickname i've twice MMR
why?
my format is like that :
hmm weird
remove it and try again
i think its because /test command again
i dont think so
I will check this later
Is there a way Neatqueue puts out a random map to play in the Each queue?
We use the system for R6 10mans and doing map bans is difficult
So we need to choose to play
Hey <@!145305657237700608> the boy‚Äôs /setMMR doesn‚Äôt work
you can choose map with /map
Did that thank you
lll check out that mmr thing, strange
did you set an /mmrceiling by chance?
Yeah I did
if you made it 33 that explains that video
its the maximum mmr anyone can be, so it puts it at 33
Hey i put in ‚Äú/selectwinner queue_num:16412 team_num:1‚Äù and this error appears
did you disable voteforresult?
if yes, then it is not possible to vote for a winner
oh okay okay then i get it now, thank you
Also whenever a queue fills up another one starts immediately, is there a way to stop that from happening?
not really, thats the whole design of the bot so that there is no interruption in queues
you can disable /setupchannels and itll clear the queue after the setup ends
Alright thank you
can we put automaticaly balanced ?
yes, /skipteamsetup
nice one and teams are balanced ?
or is it random ?
no, /skipteamsetup just automatically uses the balanced selection
awesome
I know this might sound dumb. But how do I start/complete a game with the Bot? 
Im currently testing it on a server (i disabled the voice channel part) and turned on the Test mode. So when i fill the queue it will create a chanel as it should and pings the players. Does this count as game "started" then? And if yes, how do i end the game to enter the score? and if not, how do normal players without admin commands start a game? the bot seems lovely and id love to use it but i kind of am stuck with this basic question haha
im probably missing something very obvious here. im sorry if i do
The general flow of things is this:
- Players enter the queue
- Queue fills up
- Players join Queue channel
- Players create teams
- Players vote for the winner
okay, understood! how is the create teams/vote for winner stage then triggered?
by default once all players join the queue channel
if you disable voice channels or make it optional, team selection starts automatically
cause im stuck with this
i think you have /numberofteams set to 1?
if so, thats a different thing
cuz no voting, no teams
actually we are ok about the fact that if i put mmrchange to 10 for example, MMR will be between 0 and 20 ?
ohh okay i see!
havnt looked into that yet
thanks a lot!
ill try to tinker with that
np, you can even test in <#915810764277817354> and see how it works
right, the formula will distribute between 0 and 20 mmr per match  if the mmrchange is 10
nice
and i saw Map : Random. It is a new feature ?
maps are not new no, gamemodes are new however
anytime you have Map/Gamemode selection with more than 1 option, itll automatically add a Random option
yeah but i was wondering because in my map list i saw this option "Map : Random"
okay now it worked for me after changing that part! thanks a lot mate!
<:pepeblushhi:771980582074187807>
you saw it in the map selection, right?
yep thats intentional
thats nice ^^
Is it possible to display a leaderboard for a specific queue in a channel other than the one hosting the queue itself?
if i try, even with "queue_name" it will tell me "there is no queue in this channel"
yes, if you /link to the queue channel, you can use /stats and /leaderboard from that new channel
ohh perfect!
thanks!
np, it helps to prevent queue channel spam
can i link multiple channels to the same channel?
no limit
as in to create a leaderboard channel
okay nice!
thank you lots!
okay ahhah i promise thats my last dumb question for today:
the only command of which i dont get what the purpose is is the /drafttype
what are `snake` and `straight` values? <a:DP_ConfusedDog:771553972804648980>
I added a bad explanation to <#919340161286946826> but see this website for the longer one
https://www.rookieroad.com/football/fantasy/draft-types/
Snake draft is the fairest draft, but straight draft is just the simple back and forth:
Ex: Snake - Team1, Team2, Team2, Team1, Team1, Team2, etc...
Ex: Straight - Team1, Team2, Team1, Team2, etc...
<@!145305657237700608> what was the command to ping members of the current queue again?
uhhhh there is no command for that lol
./autoping exists but it pings when the queue hits # players
i can add a /ping command tho
oh my bad i thought u had one
can do .suggest Ping command to ping queue players
i wanna try it
ahhh i see! got it now! thanks man! will be up and running on our server now! <a:happykitty:737199683906306088>
.suggest Ping command to ping all queue players
Your suggestion has been submitted to the server staff for review!
Hey <:PES_HappyStar:832941353389654078> 
I'd like to set Captions Pick with random picked captains as a default. How can I do this?
currently you can only make balanced teams the default, if you want to do captains id have to add it
that would be an awesome feature! Should be add it to the <#911057745204105237>?
for sure, someone should .suggest it
just a quick followup question regarding that: when are those changes live on the bot?
the slash commands on my server dont yet show the new commands
its kinda random, it has to register for all the servers
but still show the skipteamsetup
some people have it, some dont
within the hour itll pop up
okay i see
nice, thanks!
hey mate, sorry to bother you again:
i was just wondering about the map customization options
so currently, is the only way to choose a map a kind of "first-come-first-serve" system as in where the first person to klick on the map gets to choose? or is there a way to also set a vote on that with majority etc
its a majority vote
if you have test mode on, it wont be
ahh okay, nice to know!
thanks!
how hard would it be to add a command to substitute players in a queue?
like a /player sub [player1] [player2]
that way i wouldnt have to manually do another queue to substitute a player
ALSO: could we get an option to have a max amount of players that can be selected, and then the rest of the players get re added to the queue?

like it would be 2 teams, teamsize of 4, but 10 players can join the queue. the 2 people who dont get picked get re-added into the next queue
i can do subs probably
for the second idea, how does it determine who gets picked
well this would mostly be for the captain team selection
.suggest Ability to substitute players in a match
Your suggestion has been submitted to the server staff for review!
<@!302105910128541696> give it a try and let me know how it goes
./player sub
can only be used after teams are created
our games start with random teams after 10 people (all the players) joined the channel.

it won't let us vote for the queue type (captains, random, player pick etc.)

what may be the issue? is there any command to fix that?
it has been happening since today
yesterday everything was alright
check /info
you can change it with /teamselection
maybe i messed up the default value
hmmm i see what i did
dang
i reset every queue to Balanced defualt i think
im making it so all queues are back to the default selection menu, sorry if you dont want that!
there's no problem with that at all. The bot is amazing and we love it! ‚ù§Ô∏è
i meant more-so for the people that DO want to skip that selection menu, but now they have to reconfigure lol
ah k
So Default Selection Menu means that we've to reconfigure if we want to skip /teamselection ?
right, if you dont want to see this
then reconfigure /teamselection
okok
and even if we load a previous queue which contains the right configuration ?
uhhhhhhhh, maybe? lol
probably should work
ok xD
i will do the /teamselection again haha
thanks! ill let you know how it goes
There is a player on my server who always gets an error message ff he tries to join (or leave) any queue. If I add/remove him per command it works however. He already left and rejoined the Server and also has the exact same roles and permissions as everybody else so I can't seem to find the reason. Anyone got an idea why that may be the case and how to fix it? <a:DP_ConfusedDog:771553972804648980>
thats the message he gets
usually they have an outdated discord
hmm i see
so they cant interact with the "new" button type of commands
good point, thats very likely the case with him
not totally sure why, its just a common thing ive seen
ill let him know, thanks a lot!
cuz the bot doesnt have any errors
yeah and its such an odd error as well
so yeah its very likely its on his end
exactly, it would say interaction failed if it was on my end
yeah good point
thanks man!
<@!145305657237700608> the revert option isnt reverting peoples mmr for some reason
of course it isnt
what match num
Queue#16551
hmm it looks like it says all mmr was reverted
nope you are right
gonna update in a sec, should be fixed
wont be able to revert those old games tho
sub function doesnt seem to work unfortunately <@!145305657237700608>
is there a queue running in that channel?
hmm actually, i assume you dont have setupchannels enabled right?
yup ik why
will people be romeved from the queue after a certain idle time?
the queue is emptied after /resettimer
default is an hour
oh okay nice
thanks man!
why do I keep getting this when the bot has perms?
could be anything, maybe check the category permissions?
the bot has the perms in the category
any roles overriding the perms?
hard to tell without being in the server, its something though
nvm- i think i fixed it
ty tho!
Also- when the bot makes channels, is there any way to change what the channel name is?
not currently, the channels will always be Queue#1234 and Team # - 1234
alrighty!
Can i have the show my stats button in a different channel than the queue channel?
yup, just use /link from any other channel
oh tysm!
<@!145305657237700608> can‚Äôt Register
<@!145305657237700608>
 I have 1vs1 match. I want to send a notification when one person enters the queue and there is only one person left.
/requireregister, that‚Äôs the wrong command
/auto ping can probably do that
thx!
Still can‚Äôt
https://r6.tracker.network/profile/pc/GryxrPR
what did you pass in?
Used a link like this
no, just do the name
Ohh ok
also i forgot i had /ign as well, probably can merge the two features
combining the two right now, so you will need to re-register
Hi, i've got a question. Is this possible to display number of players queuing directly on the channel name ?
ooo, thats a cool idea. you cant do it right now, but its definitely possible üòÑ
It would be great to see directly where queuing to play
Do you want i suggest it or no ?
.suggest Show queue size directly in the channel name
Your suggestion has been submitted to the server staff for review!
I've got another question when teams are picked by random captain, how the team is balanced ?
It stills balanced by MMR ?
what do you mean balanced?
It is still chosen by captains
also, seems like the queue size in the channel name wont work, the API only lets you update channel names a few times every 10 minutes :/
yup, 2 requests per 10 minutes
i don't get it lol if it is chosen by captains where the others players will be placed ? They'll chose themselves the team ?
hey hey
we have an issue, our queue seems broken
the captains chose the teams
we can't really join
oh ok !
when we try to it shows we are already in queue, even tho we aren't
we tried to leave and rejoin, tried to reset it with command, nothing works
can you type /clearqueue right now
there is no way to reduce this time ? Like send some dollars ? xD
i did and it's acting crazy
in few seconds adding and deleting players to queue
even tho noone clicks nothing
are you sure no one is clicking?
tried it again, it still shows people in queue after running the command and it's acting crazy
hmmmm
!nq servers <@!282638047512756224>
yea that looks weird, your queue says its empty
can you /copy and give me the code?
/copy does not work, there's not such command ü§®
sorry /save lol
ah, kay
BQXME
hmmmm, i think i know why
its related to the fact you guys use the role feature
when you click the button to join, the bot waits for you to select a role. if you clearqueue while that is happening, it doesn't interrupt that person joining
when they finish joining, they still think that all the old members are in the queue
should be fixable
sounds dumb, hopefully its fixed now üôÇ
i wish discord worked this way lol
they supposedly dont make exception to rate limits except the 50/second
which isnt helpful here
yeah i was searching about this but discord limits it anyway
oh ok ok, ty you're amazing dude!!
lemme know if you run into issues, not many people use the roles feature so it doesnt get tested as much
okok
I'll let ya know instantly if I'll find any issues
<@!145305657237700608> is there a way i can give people permission to use all commands without giving them admin commands to the server?
like "anyone with "queueadmin" role can use these commands"
if someone has Manage Channels, they can use the Admin commands
i was thinking of adding an option to set a role for using the commands at some point
yeah that would be really useful
.suggest option to set a role for using commands
Your suggestion has been submitted to the server staff for review!
Can anyone help me set up my discord server? I'm looking to set up a queue, 2 teams/5 players each. I want two voice channels to be created, one per team. Should I change the number of lobbies setting to 2 to achieve this?
no, you would want 1 lobby for that. '/startqueue "Name" 5' should be all you need
or do the /setup and itll walk you through
Thank you!
np üôÇ
So I just force started my queue with 3 of us in the queue, it created only 1 VC. I'm hoping to have 2 voice channel split between the two teams. Will it create two only when the queue is full with 10 players?
the bot creates 1 Queue channel which everyone must join, then splits the players into two new Team voice channels
thats the default behavior at least
I apologize for my ignorance, so to clear, so when the queue is started after 10 players have joined, a single Voice channel is created for all 10 players to join, then once they join, the 10 players are split into 2 team of 5, with an additional 2 voice channels being created?
yup exactly, you can actually test it yourself with /test
itll let you join the queue any number of times
or use <#915810764277817354>
ahhh, awesome. Is there a way to change what voting options there are?
you can either use the entire menu, or shortcut to a single option with /teamselection
any way to select between multiple options? As an example, i'd like my players to be able to vote between captains or balanced
not currently no, its either all or nothing really
what reset timer and menu timer?
<@!145305657237700608>
huh?
What does each of these mean?
oh, resettimer is the amount of time that needs to pass without queue interaction to empty the queue due to inactivity
menutimer is how long each of the voting menus lasts
Thank you
cant select a winner through admin channel OR select winner command after using /player sub
the winner message is still there, right?
How do I end the /test?
<@!145305657237700608>
/test again
Thank you
can we change the queue name without delete all queues ?
./queuename name:
ive to refund the leaderboard after that ?
the leaderboard goes off of the queue name
if you want to change a queue name AND keep the stats, use /rename
itll copy all the old stats to the new name
i dunno remember but if i link the new leaderboard to another queue channel it will take the stats of all others queue with the same name and same parameters even if it isn't linked to them right ?
when you /link, you link the channels directly
itll fetch the leaderboard from that linked channel, no matter the queue name
what ? So the others queue channels won't be able to bring their stats on the leaderboard ?
i've to link all the queue channels to the leaderboard ?
im a bit confused at what you are asking
/link is only to be able to check your stats/leaderboards from a different channel
i want stats to be collected from all the queues channels
that happens automatically
all queues have stats
but we've to put the same queuename and same parameters right ?
Any queues with the same name will share the same leaderboard
ok and i've to put votingresults to true
no matter what, the leaderboards will be shared
okok
all stats are tied to the queue name
is there a way to make it so that only admins can vote for winners?
nah players can still choose the winner always
Is the bot not working or updating
Can‚Äôt react to the bot
Interaction failed
Discord is up to date

ill fix
with /clearqueue this does not resolve his problem ?
R6 Za server it‚Äôs not me it‚Äôs a friend who is saying that
so its not everyone?
No just one
Wait not working for me
try now
any option for multiqueue should work
Yeah ended the queue and started it again
Worked then
makes sense cuz multiqueue is enabled by default
if you have it disabled it should work though
yo i've got an issue
why people have three times mmr next to their nicknames ?
i never tested nicknames using brackets [], only with parenthesis ()
it‚Äôs probably a regex issue
i‚Äôll check it out later
ok thanks ^^
or i can do with () instead
that would probably fix it
yup but the nicknames stay like on the screen normal ?
how can i remove this bug ?
i've got the new one with ($)
but the previous one still displayed x)
each game it add another MMR next to nicknames
i think i'll remove it
and where is the graph ? It shouldn't be displayed under all informations ?
./ratinginname removeall
should help
and graph is only after multiple days
oooh ok !
i have to put the command just one time or for all queues channels ?
hi!
we've just created a new queue (with new name, so there are no old stats) and players without admin role can't use /leaderboard command, it was never an issue b4, is there something we have to do or is it an bot's issue?
Put the ShowMyStats button
Have u enabled stats?
showmystats button is clickable and they can do that
but they can't type /leaderboard, it just doesn't work
i've used /link command on stats channel
it has worked before
hmmmm
i assume that no one can use the command right <@!282638047512756224>
noone expect admins
can you try right now
still not working?
still does not work
sorry, was playing
like you just tried it?
yeah, we did try it right now
and it still does not work
also it happens in random queue
kinda scarry O_o
what do you mean
it happens only after you vote that teams are not valid
oh it messed up the teams
instead of 1 man per position
it shows 2, then 4, then 8 etc
yea i gotta refine the role feature lol
so for now its better to not use it, right>?
anyways, im not seeing an notification on my side that there is any leaderboard issue
just dont use random
or dont say its invalid teams
just fixed it, give the random option try again pls üòÑ
<@!539460712485879830> the nicknames should work now for any format
okok, we'll try it
im not understanding the new mmr system bro üíÄ
how are 2 people on team 2 losing 64 when they have 2 950s on their team
the first 10 games have a decreasing multiplier
to get you to your deserved mmr faster
mmmm i see
whats the parameters for that?
<#919340161286946826> it‚Äôs the middle part of the equation
am i buggin here?
it subbed two people
instead of just the one guy specified in the command
did you specify the queue number?
if not, maybe it replaced some old queue ?
yeah i specified it
the teams are totally different?
What are the huge features coming in later ? <@!145305657237700608>
hey! 
is there a way to substitude someone form a match with someone else after the game has been completed? so the stats get attributed to the right person
not currently, also why would you want to change the player who is in the match if they didn‚Äôt actually play?
nothing crazy yet, the first thing i want is to disable commands for people without perms
currently not released for my library but should be soon
no so the situation is:
a game has been generated. one of the people isnt there but a quick sub is organsied who plays instead but no admin is there to use the sub command. after the game to correct the stats the admins now want to change it
i can make it so players can sub THEMSELVES out
that should avoid it right
ohh yeah that would be nice too
but as a workaround for this: is there a way to edit someone's wins
as opposed to just mmr
you can use any of the /set commands
oh thanks! apparently i missed that you can set wins with that too
help
starting MMR is always putting him by default idk why ?
everytime i put it to 0 it puts solo idk how at 1000
whats happening?
i do this command

And also how do I make it where the 2 people vote who the winner was
<@!145305657237700608>
Sorry for the ping bud
channels are deleted after 5 minutes if they are not being used
just to clean things up usually
what do you mean for the 2 people vote?
When they 1v1
They both vote for the 1 winner
Me then they get the mmr
While the other person lose it
thats the default behavior
Wdym
any queue has that behavior
./startqueue /setup etc
What‚Äôs the cmd to turn it on
For the 2 people vote for the winner
its on by default
Look
It shows that
It shows ping
right
But I want it to show the players
And they vote
it says join the queue channel
if you dont want voice channels, do /voicechannels
Hmmm
Sorry if I look so stupid first time with the bot üíÄüò≠
no prob
So I do
/voicechannel
But it says
What mode
I don‚Äôt get that part
do you want voice channels to be required, optional or disabled
Disabled
when a queue is filled, usually everyone must join the voice
Hello, dashboard is not work?
but where i can to check full commands list?
help
the / cmd doesnt work in my server
do i need to place the bot higher up the hierarchy?
oh the commands are gone, right?
should be coming back
Commands should be back
./help has them, also the dashboard is back up as well
when people join to queue it doesn't add them on our server, it seems a little bugged
we can't play at all today
i did the update late last night, so things might be a bit strange
looks like you guys are joining on my end
so maybe you just need to /clearqueue
I'll try
still nothing :/
it didnt send a new message?
it did not
one sec
what happens now?
it worked
queue is cleared
tysm
np, im not sure how that happened...
Is there a way to just set the afktimer to a certain amount of time WITHOUT also enabling the auto kick for going offline?
the offline kick is actually disabled right now
waiting for perms
ill add an option tho
what determines the amount of rr you get from win/loss?
<#919340161286946826>
overall it‚Äôs a formula of your mmr vs the other team, your placement matches, and your streak
Cool ty!
The new leaderboard is only for RL or nop?
no it‚Äôs everything
i‚Äôve noticed an issue for certain queue names that i‚Äôll have to fix
currently i store the queue name, leaderboard type, and page number in the file name so i don‚Äôt have to store it myself, but that doesn‚Äôt work if the name has special chars so i‚Äôll need to modify them
Ah okay thanks! Nice to know!
<@!145305657237700608> 
when i do 1v1 queues, even after i set required votes to majority, it stills only need 1 vote, which causes alot of ppl to self vote. Can you fix this
its fine now
Hello guys, ready good bot, where i can to send vouch?
Anyone know how to off mmr votes and in general MMR?
vouch?
Do you know what vouch mean <@!145305657237700608> ?
yes lmao
Ahaha
/leaderboardsize num doesn't work ?
What is the command to ShowMyStats button ?
i don't see it on /help
it‚Äôs just /statsbutton
and i disabled leaderboard size for now since it doesn‚Äôt work for the image
images can‚Äôt be any larger than the size they are
thanks i do not see it on /help that's why lol
i didn't get the difference between page and images for leaderboard ?
its just the new leaderboard vs the old one
if you prefer the old one
oh ok but i didn't even touch at anything and i got the new one, normal ?
image is the default one now ?
With this bot, is it possible to lock team size/amount of teams to the channel it is created in, and only allow one queue at a time **per channel?
a queue is created with a specified team size and number of teams, so yes
and you can only have 1 queue per channel, but after the queue is full it will empty itself
That all seems ideal for what I'm looking for, but I meant is it possible to skip all configuration of a user choosing team size? I.e. can I make it to where a user with a specific role does something like /startqueue and the queue starts and bot sets the user cap determined by the channel the queue was started in
the way it works is that an admin starts a queue, and then it runs forever
users dont need to use commands, they just join
after the queue is full, it will reset itself
try it out in <#915810764277817354>
Okay that also seems like it'd be great. What about sending a ping to the users of a "full queue" to let them know they're in a group together. I saw it was possible to ping roles for that result, but wasn't sure if it could just be user specific
when a queue is filled it will automatically ping all players to tell them its ready
also it shows a ping button that unlock after 60 seconds
Awesome, will the ping message always show up in the channel the queue was created or can I direct every message to a single channel for all varying queues
sorry for asking so many questions lol
by default the bot creates a new channel for the players to setup teams/message each other
you can change with /setupchannel
Ah, every time I tried to run that command and enable/disable the bot would just return that there were no active queues so I was getting confused
you need to start a queue first
/startqueue or /setup
or use the web dashboard https://www.neatqueue.com
Thank you so much for your help. I'll play around with it some more, it's looking like it has the majority of features I was looking for
no prob, lmk if you have questions
What exactly does /link between two channels do? Is it supposed to direct messages to that channel instead of the breakaway channels? I'm able to link two channels but notice no difference in outcomes. I'm also not sure if the dashboard is broken or if it's an issue with my PC, but changes don't save and I can't select things from dropdown menus
when you type /stats and /leaderboard, it requires a queue running the channel
/link just tells it where to look for that queue
website is kinda scuffed ngl
Ah okay, I can work with breakaway channels for notifying users their queue is full. Will those channels be auto cleaned up or archived for moderation? Is there any way to change that timer?  I assumed it was /cleanuptimer but that doesn't seem to change anything on my end.
they are deleted yes
after the match is voted upon
cleanuptimer will automatically end a match which also deletes the channels
Is there a way to bypass "match voting" so the queue can be seen as finished? I also tired setting cleanuptimer to low passes of time, like 5-15 seconds and channels still lingered.
Answered my own question on the voting part lol. Maybe that's causing conflict
if you disable voting, cleanuptimer does not apply
actually it does
itll delete the channels after that timer
How to make the bot -100mmr
Like for one person?
<@789488988179398677>
The person who losses
Does a admin have to do
if the match was reported wrong a admin would have to fix it
:Add lost
I want the bot to - 100mmr when people lose and add -100mmr when they win
./mmrchange
Set that to 100
Ok Ty
For some reason the queue is not showing up (no join/leave) anyone know why
if I end it and start another queue, it also doesn't show up
It created that queue just fine?
I had an issue where I tried to forcestart it or it tried to auto start but it didn't have send message permissions in that channel
so then i think i got messed up
Try clearing the queue and starting it again
wow /clearqueue fixed it thnx
How to make the bot stop sending queues In the channel
like end all queues?
Nvm I got it
What happens if a que is not posting
what do you mean?
It‚Äôs suppose to post the queue here
But it‚Äôs not
Before it was
But now
It‚Äôs taking long
Or smth
did you start the queue?
How?
I setup it
./startqueue or /setup
I did
It says
‚ÄúThis channel already has a queue‚Äù
run /clearqueue
I had this problem yesterday where the queue didn‚Äôt show up, but I had run it and everything, just keep trying cause it will work. I was using the website to do that
yea i should probs just disable the website
<@!789488988179398677> did everything come up?
It‚Äôs not to bad some areas are buggy but yeah it‚Äôs fine
I tried a couple of times and it eventually come up
one of my final projects is to create a pretty indepth website so im probs gonna use this as a "two birds one stone"
start from scratch
Yeah, I filled out all the info and then pressed start queue nothing came up in the server but also it unticked the channel a few times.
It did
To easy do you need help with anything else?
Have a good rest of your day/night
You too
Thanks
<@!145305657237700608>
That‚Äôs very odd
<@!574163727755116556> may be a bug in the leaderboard cause it‚Äôs not every leaderboard just yours
Why mee üòÇüòÇ
Can you inv me to your server and I‚Äôll look into it
Lucky ig
Dm me inv link
Fixed thanks you
<@!145305657237700608> just a little glitch I think but I fixed it
Anyways night
looks like a client side glitch
it‚Äôs just an upload image so it‚Äôs not really possible for it to do anything crazy like that
How do i stop the bot spamming the que?
spamming?
As soon as a que ist started
And i write a message
The bot is sending the q again if u understand what i mean
that is by design, otherwise the queue message gets lost
So it cannot be stopped?
you can end the queue with /endqueue
otherwise no you cant disable the message from updating
since you need the buttons to be visible for you to queue
My suggestion is make 2 separate channels, use one channel to talk and a separate just to queue
I'm one of the admins for the server he's asking about. I have a server of nearly 2000 members & so far, this is the best bot I've found to use for our FACEIT games. I do have a couple of questions though.
Sure go ahead
Go ahead viz
I'm looking through FAQ to see if they are answered there first. But the most important one to me currently is getting it setup to where captains pick their teammates. We used snake pick in the past.
by default the players pick how they want teams picked, either Balanced, Captains, Random, Players Choose, or Unfair
you can change this with /teamselection if you want to skip to Captains
default is Snake draft too
Okay, I already figured out turning of the voice channel creation as this is for console players
Yeah did you use command or do it on the website ?
website is disabled ^
Command. I actually prefer doing everything from commands lol
Yeah, I wondered because I went to look at the dashboard there & it was just a leaderboard
Same, but when the website was available it was good
Yeah currently building a new website <@!145305657237700608> is
We used to use the Elo Bot, I had that bot figured out so well. But API changes made them not want to save the bot & tourney bot with pickup games is just not the same
Yeah
yea NeatQueue benefits from being newer, its already up to date with API requirements
and Tourney bot is a bit different from a PUG bot in my experience for sure
Anything else you need help with <@!504159788268126242>
Not currently as of yet. Oh, is there a premium feature with this bot?
not yet, everything is free
Okay, cool. üôÇ I'll ask if I have more questions. But thank you for this bot, really. I'm running through figuring everything out on my test server, but we will be putting it in our FACEIT server.
Any commands that you would like to know, as in you wanna do something but don‚Äôt know the command?
I see that there is an add map command, is there a way to add maps in a way that it will randomly pick a map for us?
I‚Äôm not as fond with that command as I don‚Äôt have to use it, but neat will answer that
when you add more than 1 map, itll show a voting menu where you pick the map (which has a random option)
Okay, thanks.
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/910981294937210930/922743163695808543
command has changed but you get the idea
Yes, I do. Thank you. I can't think of anything else but if I do, I'll come right back here & ask. I appreciate all of the help
how do i set everyone's mmr back to 1000?
and games
and wins/losses
How many people are in the server?
about 30 who have queued
./resetstats
that wont reset settings right
or change the queue name
no, just player stats
tyty
Maybe you could do that neat
Have a reset all players mmr command not all stats just mmr
Then server staff for bot can change to how much mmr gets taken when command is applied or what everyone‚Äôs mmr goes too
meh perhaps
ill probs just make a way to export/import player data
idk if that would be helpful for people though
Would help with what I use it for
since it cant be a csv or excel format
Cause some queue server do a monthly reset
maybe /reset all, /reset mmr, etc
I disabled the voting for a winner, would admin/staff role have the ability to decide on the winner of a game? I can't trust this particular community to vote for the winners correctly so we use screenshots of the game & admin/moderators determines the winning team.
/ resultschannel set
Then type in channel you want it to go to
Just had to add space between / and it otherwise i would have to do it
Hi I need help with neat queue
What with exactly homie?
So when I‚Äôm on the website and I click dashboard it just brings be back to where I have to log in
Website is being redone, don‚Äôt use website
Use the commands
Inv me to the server and I‚Äôll get it up for you
Ok I just need a leaderboard
<@!774732621443629076> you can delete the link now
I joined
Thanks for your help and time
All good homie
that‚Äôs wrong
disabling voting for winner doesn‚Äôt show any results
Is there a command that can change what all players start with on MMR?
yes, /startingmmr
the default has the (@)everybody at 1000, so either change that role or delete its /startingmmr
Okay, thanks. I haven't had enough coffee to function yet today so I didn't consider the everyone role lol
np, its in the /info
which i am about to update to make it look nicer
yup its on /info page 3
Thank you
I know there's a command for it, I can't find it & can't remember it now. I came across it last night. But a command that shows the roles & different ways a queue is setup.
it should all be in /info
i just updated the command so its not a huge block of text so its different
No, that's not it. There was one that actually showed the MMR for that lobby. I'd screenshot it so people can see what each rank is in terms of points
i mean when teams are created, it will show the average team rank
This is old & it was on Elo. There was something that looked like that. I post that specifically so people can see what points get you what rank.
that should be /autoroles
the setup is on /info page 6
where players earn roles for their mmr, right?
I have that setup, I just need to be able to take a picture like that so I can post in a channel that my players can see.
right, that should be available on /info page 6
OH, I have 3 pages of info
really?
can u screenshot
I tried again, it's working now. It wasn't responding beyond 3rd page earlier
oh thats weird
I've been having issues with discord itself. I can't even scroll through commands in my test server, so I'm looking through it on the server I'm planning on using it for
try again real quick?
ill check logs
My test server? Looking through the commands?
oh i thought you mean scrolling with the /help buttons
That's what happens when I scroll through the commands on my test server lol
oh thats weird for sure
definitely not my fault lmao
Discord is well discord lol
<@!145305657237700608> yeah I thought when canceling/disabling winner vote you could still set it up in a staff chat so the staff have to chose the winner.
But I told him that he Wouldn‚Äôt be Able to vote
If ties were turned off maybe a week or two ago any idea why it‚Äôs still affecting win rate? Option to vote tie isn‚Äôt there so i‚Äôm not sure how i‚Äôm getting ties.
ties still happen if the /cleanuptimer ended and it deleted the match cuz it wasn‚Äôt voted upon
perhaps that‚Äôs a mistake on my end, we can just delete the match completely instead
im changing it now where if you have ties disabled and the match doesnt get voted upon, instead of marking it as a tie itll just not show up in your stats
Any word on the idea about having the queue open to 8+ people but having teams set to 4v4?
i still dont really understand the point of doing that
plz explain
If a pool of 8+ people want to play, ranges of skill level within, we have more variety of people to pick from. 

What happens now is since it doesnt stop once teams are picked at 4v4, if we open the draft to 12 and 12 people join the bot auto picks after we already established teams at 4v4. we have to  delete that queue and manually enter into a new one which is an extra step people are stubborn on doing (both mods and players)
right if you set the queue size at 12, it doesnt really make sense to pick a 4v4 from it currently
so you want a queuesize of 12, but only 8 people playing?
10/12
I think we did 14 a couple times but usually 10/12
so how did that turn into a 4v4
We only play 4v4
but you did queues of 10,12, and 14
Yes.
that doesnt make sense
Here is a quick clip of the game we play. Red team vs blue team. 4v4 is the max.
If you do not get picked up, you wait for the draft to be over and hope you get picked up next, captain yourself and pick your own team or you didnt get picked cause no one wants to play with people that suck (usually this one lol)
However there are times 10/12/14 skilled players join and you wanna build a nice team.
For a ‚Äògood draft‚Äô
Does it make more sense now?
i get it, but seems weird that you can keep queueing up and just never play a game...
Sounds unfortunate but get better lol, no one likes to lose
There are times that the queue has only 8 people and those people who dont get picked in the bigger queues get to play but they dont showcase any improvement so what can you really do about that lol.
my main issue is that the bot currently expects that all players in the queue are actually playing, so all the team setup options are configured to use all players
Would making a command to i guess turn that off fix that? I‚Äôm not sure how you could code that
well yes it would require a new command, but I would have to change the team selections themselves
since how would balanced work
Could you put a 4v4 selection?
nah thats too specific for a game
What‚Äôs the difference between captains and players pick?
players pick will show a button for each possible team, and players can join the team they want directly
I‚Äôm not sure how to help lol
id have to think about if its worth the effort to me
For the leaderboard, is there an option to see the entire server leaderboard instead of just each queue?
Stats are stored via the queue name, so any leaderboard is only for a specific queue name
if you have multiple queues with the same name, its the same leaderboard
but no, you cant combine them anyway
Okay, I ask because as I get my server back to being active, we may have to sort by regions. And when I submit the months winners to the game developers to, it has to have all of the stats together. I can manually figure that out. Would it be too difficult to add a server wide leaderboard at some point? Or is it better this way because of the api??
So you want region specific leaderboards, as well as a combined one with all regions?
No, the queues will be made based on region. All I would like to see is one combined leaderboard for the entire server.
right, so would the region queues have their own leaderboards or no?
so region specific leaderboards and a combined one
actually shouldnt be too bad to add
a server wide leaderboard shouldnt be too bad to add
also
That‚Äôd be great! üôÇ but your bot is in my main server now and everyone loves it very much so far
<#910981294937210930>
So does a mod just input that command once teams reach 4v4?
Yo <@145305657237700608> /staffchannel can be used in multiples channels or it is associated only for one channel ?
hmm currently it resets the queue with that command
maybe shuoldnt
./staffchannel is set for all queues
yeah i know that but i mean can we send results on multiples channels for the same queuename ?
staffchannel is one channel
if thats your question
ok and it is possible to add the possibility to permit it on multiples channels to separate the moderation if we want to categorize it ?
without changing the queuename i mean
idk if u know what i mean
So the staffchannel is 1 channel for all queues/channels
you cant split it up
yeah i know but it is possible to add an option to do it ?
meh i dont see that as necessary
such a small difference
sure
So once we have our team of 4 we should use the command to stop it from auto picking without having to delete the draft basically?
I feel like I'm such a bothersome person lol but it would actually help a lot for my server as we keep on getting it back to being active for games. The only reason it stopped was when Elo Bot stopped allowing registrations & we couldn't register for more users. But with this bot, games are going to start becoming more frequent, more people playing means we will have even more queus
The multiple staff channel in different categories will help a LOT.
Last question can we setup /resultschannel in differents channels or there is only 1 channel for all queues with the same queuename ?
resultschannel is per queue
unlike staffchannel currently
nice
what is the need to be monitoring the staff channel?
its really only to modify results of a queue you need
Because we monitor/modify all of the games that are scored.
how come?
My community isn't voting for a winner, they are letting staff do it. Which I prefer at any rate, just keeps everyone honest.
whats more honest than a majority vote lmao
Well, we are officially recognized by our game as the faceit games for console platform of this game. And we get a pretty big sponsoring for the winners of the season, so most people don't want to risk us losing that. Games are moving pretty quick right now so no one votes, they just queue for the next game.
And trust me, with this community, them having the option to make sure a team/someone doesn't get MMR COULD be a thing, so we do have to monitor it lol
Why staffchannel can't be per queue like resultchannel ? Is it a limited function ?
no thats just how i set it up
I don't understand the command /queuesizeoverride ? In what case it is usefull ?
pretty much never
ok xD
example: a queue size of 10 but 4v4
2 people are left out
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
this is like forcestart or something ?
more choices in players
kinda?
both are similar in they change the actual number of players that should be able to play
am i doing this correctly? isnt the queue size supposed to show as 12 here?
click join
it doesnt reset the queue so its the old num
can i suggest to have the option to put staffchannel per queue like resultchannel or it is definitely not possible ? Because for those who prefer to keep just one queuename for all differents possibles gamemodes for some discord, it would be greatly usefull for moderate it imo...
alright alright
Agreed, people queue to play not be kicked from the queue if not picked.
i added it, wouldnt suggest using it though lol
let me know how the staffchannels go
Sounds good
Tysm ill test it tomorrow
Works very well tysm man
By testing i've seen an issue btw
Number of players still at 0 even if i load it with another channel well configured
and i'm not in test mode
very weird i clearqueue or endqueue but still the same
<@!539460712485879830> I would help but that‚Äôs a <@!145305657237700608> question I don‚Äôt know about the bot.
And his coding ect
He‚Äôs currently asleep tho
So he‚Äôll get back to you within 6-7 hours
ok np ty
Thanks
i've noticed the bug only for /queueintoteam when it is on false all works fine but on true no
still doesn't working
i can fix it in a bit
Bahah
Exactly 6-7 hours lmao
That‚Äôs funny
try now
I‚Äôve cleared the queue and it seems to work 0/7 appeared
I will test it now
Ok it works !
What was the problem?
side effect of the queuesizeoverride
changed something i shouldnt have
And just to know do we have to end queue to load a new one or not necesseraly ?
what do you mean?
like with /load?
nope it doesnt matter
itll either create a new one or overwrite the current
Is there a way to see how many games are played in a server/queue?
uhhhhh i dont think so
maybe a serverstats command could be cool
i can tell you how many if you want tho
<@145305657237700608> is there a command to change the time each person has to pick a player?
i think /menutimer should impact it but i can‚Äôt remember
That would be great, I rely a lot on that information lol
i just added /serverstats, should appear shortly
Thanks!
<@145305657237700608> can u give me panel bot neatqueue
huh?
i want website bot <@857633321064595466>
not sure what you mean
I believe he is asking for a dashboard
oh lol, well the dashboard is under maintenance for now so it‚Äôs unavailable
what exactly does /cancel do?
deletes the current match so there is no winner
how would I go about adding a seperate text channel for 4mans queue?
just create a new channel and /startqueue
or /setup
gotcha thanks
oh, you can also /save your 6mans channel
and /load it in the 4mans if you want
thanks Neat you the goat fr
Well, one of my admin deleted a vote as we‚Äôve already had issues with our lovely community voting the wrong winners. (Toxic and idiots) is there a way to score a game where the vote was deleted?
Wdum
<@!504159788268126242> not sure about that, if no command then just fix it manually
what do you mean deleted a vote?
Voting for the winner, admin deleted it because people weren‚Äôt being honest with voting
well /selectwinner and the staffchannel let you choose the winner, but if the message is gone it‚Äôs not gonna work
just by design currently
to avoid concurrency issues
Yeah, that's what I was wondering. We'll have to add manually it seems since the voting message is deleted
if you wait i can add a fix later
Okay, I'll wait.
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
yea i‚Äôll make it so that it doesn‚Äôt matter with the staffchannel or /selectwinner
cuz it should be able to override
Okay, thank you sooo much ‚ù§Ô∏è
actually its not gonna be at easy as I thought, the match is stored in the database via the winner message id, so without it its kinda hard to end the match lol
probs cant fix today
Okay, I'll manually score it.
<@!145305657237700608> can we get a command to edit peoples Win rate
Cause someone on my server has a 200% win rate
how is that possible
oh, well the equation is just wins/total games
I added a win to venoxide
But that shouldn‚Äôt have screwed up his winrate
i don‚Äôt think those commands change the number of total games
they should probably
So what do I do?
Hi I need help with Neat Queue our first server got hacked so we need something set up again
What commands are disabled if a user who has already started a match presses JoinQueue?
<@145305657237700608>
i‚Äôll add a way to change a players total games
what with specifically?
there aren‚Äôt any commands that are disabled
oh wait you already can lol, /set games
What /set games do ?
set total number of games played for a player
there is a total games leaderboard
and its used in the winrate calculation
i dont get it sorry lol
ok but what we've to do by setting total number of games ? Its like putting a limit per player ? For what ?
the /set commands just let you manually adjust player stats
shouldnt use them really
how come in help it says /queues to see all current queues
but it doesnt work?
oops, its /serverstats now
ah nice
also how do i reset the leaderboard?
you can do /resetstats, or just change the queue name
since the stats are tied to the queue name, if its a new name its new stats
I did /resetstats all then the name of the queue
and did leaderboard again and it didnt work for some reason
ill just rename it all g
i just tried it and it worked
did you confirm?
idk why it aint working hmm
is it case Sensitive?
I put Valorant instead of valorant maybe?
yes it is case sensitive
hahaha
ill try again
got it now
all g
glad to hear
On the maps, is there a way where we can choose for them to always be random instead of being voted for?
not currently no, could add that though if desired
Honestly, that would really save me a bit of a headache if you could lol
how come?
Because a big part of my server is adapting to a map & not just picking the same one over & over again. People avoid maps because they don't like them. (we have 7 maps) It is a rule for maps to be random, it forces people to play differently & play different classes. Defeats the purpose if people vote for the same 2 or 3 over & over again.
My community is something else, I'm telling you. lol
Hi I have to go now but I need help with setting up the leaderboard in the 1v1 channel
alright let me know
I actually have a bit of time now
If you can help
I‚Äôm sure I can do it myself if You tell me the commands
either works for me
Ok Can I invite you?
I don‚Äôt own it so I need to explain
I need you to make it where the role Head Moderator Moderator Admin and Owner can see the queues even if they aren‚Äôt in it and the leaderboard
https://discord.gg/etWH2kXz
So /set to change players games and add win Is to change win rate?
winrate is calculated as: (wins + losses) / games
so if you used /set to change any of those, you need to change games to not mess up the winrate
That's a permissions thing. You can set their actual permissions to being able to see pretty much everything.
correct, or /staffroles
Thanks so much <@!145305657237700608>
Ohh I see
again, you shouldnt really use /set unless you want some low level stat changes
changing match outcomes should be all you need
Thanks
How do you set the timer of when the queue resets again?
./resettimer
Is there a way to make it infinite? So until the queue pops?
Put 0 I think
no, 0 will just insta reset
just put a huge number
Yeahh, need the random maps only. How nice do I have to be? XD lol
its actually added, just waiting for the command to be registered üòÑ
Ohhh, thank youuuuu ‚ù§Ô∏è
You have no idea how much of a headache this is so this will help ‚ù§Ô∏è
np, its /map selection
so just keep checking for it to appear
Thanks so much
It appears in the test server, not in my main server yet lol
yea who knows how it works
Discord, I swear lmao
<@145305657237700608> the bot still makes uneven teams whenever there are 9 players in the queue
teamsize of 4
is that with the queuesizeoverride
yeah
queuesizeoverride is on like 12
but we forcestarted with 9
how did you pick teams
assuming it was captains, should be good now
cool cool
<@145305657237700608>
Got a problem with the (are these teams fair or even) thing once teams are picked
what is it
When they click on the redo teams options as in they are unfair or whatever it puts them on the same team about 3 times in a row
Or more
yea its just fully random
should probably fix that to avoid recreating the same teams
Yeah
Just annoying having to keep clicking it and getting the same team
valid
I understand maybe it  doing it the first time but when it keeps doing it aha
Or even them being the same once in a while
Is there a command to make the amount of time a captain has to pick longer?
./menutimer
Thanks, I see that now. Multitasking is killing my soul lol
no worries
<@964533843682000946> what do you need help with.
Anything in particular ?
<@914753310542688326>
Can I advertise here
This server is for support for the bot, not for promotion.
I can't activate the <@857633321064595466> bot it's hard can u join my server and help me
Ask me questions about what you need help with.
You want to start the queue? In a channel?
It's for 1v1
In bedwars
/ startqueue
<@914753310542688326>
Why u have only one bot -_-
Wait no two
In this server
Wdum
Hello guys, i'm having a trouble opening NeatQueue's dashboard (settings), everytime i click on dashboard i land in the leaderboard option and this option only
Is there a way go open the bot's settings?
i used to open it from this URL https://www.neatqueue.com/dashboard/settings but it's being kinda empty since 1 week or so...
Do you wanna start a queue in your server <@208736572500082688> ?
What do you need to do in the dashboard?
no i already did with the commands i just want to access the settings page that was accessible at the very beginning
the dashboard is disabled for now unfortunately
to see if there is any other options available that are not in the commands 
and this page was opening before why did it stop
ah alright ty for the fast response
Everything on the dashboard can be access via commands
^^^^
The commands have all the customization, the dashboard barely had any
great
it was super outdated
well i got another question then
Go ahead
is it possible to change the bot's profile picture?
no that is not possible
limitation from discord
if not i would like to suggest it if possible
As it would change everyone else‚Äôs pfp for the bot
alright that's it
thanks guys
amazing bot you got
yup, users can have custom profiles with Nitro, but bots dont have that possibility at all
thanks!
pretty handy tho
The only thing that felt a lot is the possibility to put directly th√© number of player queueing into the channel name. Discord takes bad decisions sometimes :/
Wdum
the idea was that the queue channel would show the current queue size
Would be great but Discord limits at 2 times per 10 minutes refresh
yea its kinda too slow to be meaningful
what about if there was a feature to show if the channel has anybody in the queue, instead of the number of players?
so like when the queue wasnt empty it would be like
That would be useful
Yeah but how would you do this with only 2 refresh per 10 min ?
it just wouldnt be super up to date
yep it could be interesting to see if the community appreciate it but it seems to be
imo i'd like to see it
Wdum?
<@!145305657237700608> if Discord API authorize only 2 channel edits per 10 min it is like 1 channel edit every 5 min so ?
both new commands seems to not work, it is normal ?
it edits the channel asap
but there is a cd after the edit ?
like 10 min
after 2 edits yes
ok i get it
if you joined queue and then left queue, it would use both the edits
and wait 10 minutes
and why the new commands doesn't appear for me ?
hmm doesn‚Äôt look like they appeared anywhere
i only got channelrestrictions command
maybe we hit the command limit, i‚Äôll have to check
the command should be available
i think i forgot to restart bot last night
im confused about the /cancel command
why does it only work in the offical queue channels and not in the actual game channels?
my members dont have a write permission in the queue channel cause its supposed to stay clean
it works in any channel that has the message to select a winner
hmm okay it didnt work just now
i just tested it
teams are selected?
yeah they were
ill have a look and send you a screen
alright
can you include the teams message?
yeah one mom
you mena the starting message on the channel as well?
mean*
no, you need the message where you can vote for the winner
ohh okayyy
i see
i have a delay on that
okay
yea there is a delay by default too
whats the command to change that again?
kinda a sideeffect of how i implemented things cuz the actual match isnt put in the database until that team message pops up
so its not possible to cancel any earlier for now
./delaywinnervote
got it
thanks man!
makes sense!
thanks
i got an error message when i try to use the new commands
like the bot doesn't work anymore or something
hmm yea that command seems to be broken
i probs messed up in updating the bot
tell me when i can retry
should work now
It won't create a lobby in my server
1 sec
idk why but like half the files didnt update
try now
It worked, thank you
<@145305657237700608> does the admin role command allow people to add and remove players from queue
uhhhhh no
but it probably should
actually
yes it should be able to
What lock a queue command is usefull for ? I dont understand
If you wanna prevent people from queuing while fixing the queue or if wanna prevent someone from queuing till you mute them or whatever
Always good to have it
yea more like a safety command
if you just wanna pause things
ok ok
I dont get the point about anticheat commands if MMR is already reduced when a player abuse playing against a lower player ?
Another question, can you delete the previous queue automatically when we load another queue in the same channel ? Because actually, the previous one has to be delete manually. It will be better if the loaded queue replace directly the previous one.
Wdum)
wdym*
queues are deleted automatically after the /cleanuptimer
Oh ok !
And what is for anticheat commands ?
MMR isnt already reduced by playing the same players over and over again?
imagine someone created new accounts and started queueing against themself
ohhhh
and how the command works so?
how the command can find a player who did this ?
set an /anticheat channel and the alerts will pop up there
i'll try
/defaultchannel is for putting players when they have finished their queue ?
oh but the default channel must be a voice channel ? Why it cannot be a text channel ?
you cant move someone to a text channel lol
mmhhh but when we finished a queue and the temporary voice channel disappear we're all dropped into text channels when the defaultchannel command is not configured
not sure what you mean dumped into text channels
dropped mb
not sure what you mean still
./defaultchannel will move the players from their voice channel to the default channel
nvm if you say thats not possible it means thats not possible haha
im just not quite sure what you are asking
just asking if it was possible to dropped players into a text channel by default after their queue but it seems to be not possible
maybe a discord limitation
you mean switch what text channel is being  viewed?
oh, yea thats not possible
its gonna be the servers default channel
and i dont get the diffrence between image or text for leaderboard ? /leaderboardtype type
Sets the leaderboard to be created with images or text ???
right, the default leaderboard is a single image
the old version is just text, not an image
oh ok i thought we'll be able to put a background or something lol
nahh not that
do i have to configure autoroles for each queues with the same queuename or it is ok to do it once only ?
autoroles are per queue, so you have to repeat them
thats why /autoroles copy exists
cuz its annoying to rewrite
/save /load doesn't work too ?
that also works
but will overwrite the entire queue
balanced by MMR or roles isn't the same thing ?
roles are set by MMR so... ?
say that you gave all your discord members roles based on their in game rating
you can choose to abandon balancing by MMR to focus on using those roles
but yea if you have autoroles set up, they are similar in their functionality
Players who reach 50 or fall below 100 MMR will be given the üíÆGenin role.

Players who reach 100 or fall below 150 MMR will be given the üíÆCh√ªnin role.

Players who reach 150 or fall below 200 MMR will be given the üíÆJ√¥nin role.

Players who reach 200 or fall below 250 MMR will be given the üíÆAnbu role.

Players who reach 250 or fall below 9999999 MMR will be given the üíÆKage role.

Do i have to put like +1 point at 100, 150, 200, 250 or the bot will understand like that ?
i'm testing the autoroles feature
the lower bound is inclusive, the upper bound is exclusive
so if you have the boundaries like that, itll work fine
sure ? Because i can put it like that maybe its better ? 
Players who reach 50 or fall below 99 MMR will be given the üíÆGenin role.

Players who reach 100 or fall below 149 MMR will be given the üíÆCh√ªnin role.

Players who reach 150 or fall below 199 MMR will be given the üíÆJ√¥nin role.

Players who reach 200 or fall below 249 MMR will be given the üíÆAnbu role.

Players who reach 250 or fall below 9999999 MMR will be given the üíÆKage role.
someone at  99 MMR wont have any role then
oh yes lol
Anticheat is on by default ?
the account age is since its creation or since it is arrived on the server ?
account creation
also anticheat wont do anything unless you set an anticheat channel
oh ok
and what if unfortunately a player lose 5 games in a row by no luck ?
or win 5 games by skills lol
the bot will just put these players on anticheat channel to prevent ?
isn't be better to put the minimum at 10 or something like that ?
because 5 it is possible
you can customize it
also the bot doesnt prevent them from anything
it just alerts you
you can clear the user after
okok
idk what is changing constantly the starting mmrs on certain queues but it is annoying lol
i've the feeling that is when i save and load
strange
right now /save and /load dont load any server specific info, cuz you can /load a config from any server
what ?
i can load from any server ?
you can share configs between servers, yes
and so what ? Why my configuration doesn't stay like i've putted it ?
since starting MMR is by discord role, and discord roles are server specific, they are not put into the config
mmmhhh
anticheat channel is per queue too ?
ive setup an anticheat channel but it stills say to me None on /infos lol
okay /load will include the starting mmr if it can now
anticheat channel is per server
oh that's why
so the anticheat channel is linked to the queuename ?
no, its for the entire server
1 channel per server
its cannot be by channel ?
okok
whats the difference between staff channel and staff result channel ?
staff result channel we can adjust results
but staff channel ?
its the same thing
a staffchannel can be per queue, or server wide
with autoroles command, is the new role replace the previous one or both still there ?
and another question, if we reset MMR, is the role disappear with ?
depends how you set it up
oh no x)
we cannot set it up in order to start a new season or something ?
because if players keep their previous roles, they cannot restart at bottom
i've set ip up with /autoroles command and balanced by MMR ?
why what
with this setup, roles will be replaced or nop ? And what i've to do in order to replace each one of them everytime ?
and if i reset each month MMRs, if players queue with 0 MMR, we are according to they will be lose their previous role for the new one at the bottom ?
if you have the boundaries line up where there is no overlap, the roles will be removed/added correctly
and maybe resetstats should remove assigned roles
Is there a way to just set the mmr to a specific about lost per game?
huh?
like i did so it should be good ?
maybe or sure ? xD
and last question, when mmr is reset, the player have to queue again to say to the bot he's at 0 MMR or the bot knows directly that he's at 0 and can give to the player the first ranking role ?
when you reset all stats, the bot forgets everything about all players
so yea its the first time setup for a player
Instead of MMR being lost/gained by a formula & based on a percentage, can we do it be a specific amount?
./mmrchange has an optional argument 'static' which will make it fixed
Okay, I wanted to make sure
I am unable to cancel games in my server, it keeps a displaying an error message  "cancel in matchroom" or something like that. I assume that it means the text channel of the queue room. I tried and it would not accept
you can only cancel after teams are created
make sure that‚Äôs the case, otherwise send a screenshot!
Same error happens when i wait for teams to be made, do i have to wait fully till the submit score section pops up?
I think it is
allright ill check again today
Cause it happened to me but I forgot to mention it
Once made you can cancel
allright ty
Is there a way to hide players nicknames in the queue when they queue to avoid people to see their opponent nicknames before the game start ?
Because even if its balanced by something, when players can chose their team, some people are affraid to play some others players and unqueue to avoid them
And if a player even quit after seeing someone nickname he doesn't want to play with, the other player or players will win by forfeit so the voteresult will chose the winner like actually. 
With this new feature, people could not see and choose to play their opponents as a real ranked game works.
You can change names in the queue if u want
I think that helps
Nicknames or discord names is the same issue because sometimes, players got the same with both
is that possible to suggest it <@145305657237700608> ?
Is it possible to have captains submit score at the end of the game rather then vote
sure you can
not currently
.suggest option to hide players nicknames in the queue when they queue to avoid people to see their opponent nicknames before the game start because in 1v1s games, some people are affraid to play some others players and don't queue to avoid them.
Your suggestion has been submitted to the server staff for review!
does that mean that in the future there is a possibility captains can manually submit score rather then it being voted
Ensure that players in the queue do not join a new queue.
im currently working on a clan/team system which would allow for team vs team queues where only the captains would vote
so that could be included as well <@274439675043643393>
./multiqueue False
because the issue i have rn is after a game is finished people queue into the next game, and sometimes they forget to vote for score
so i have to go back and set score
if you also set /multiqueue False, it wont let the players requeue until they vote
so that would help you
really?
thanks
yup /multiqueue False prevents players from joining a new queue if
- They have not voted for an existing game
- Are currently in another queue
i have an error with
**/outcome cancel queue_num**
it says match doesnt exist or something like that
what exactly does it say
"queue doesn't exist"
even though the number was correct
i dont think thats an error message
i dont remember writing that lmao
its something around those lines im going to screen shot it exactly next time it happens
the queue didnt start yet
you can only choose the outcome after teams are created
oh i see
I‚Äôm running into an issue with my group. They are very points driven & I know you can set the amount to a set win/lose amount. I have players that have played way more games and have a higher win/loss ratio. Like this guy, he‚Äôs played so many games and won more than half of his games by a lot.
Is it possible to set multiple channels as default channels?
What do you mean by that?
Default channels for what?
- /defaultchannel channel: command sets 1 channel that i choose as a default channel right, now i was wondering if i can add more channels so players who are in the queue can be picked from other channels in the server whenever the team size is complete
To move players from/ into
no you can only set one cuz it drops all players into it at the end
everyone goes to the same place
what‚Äôs the issue?
i implemented the change to the mmr formula so players won‚Äôt lose / gain as much MMR
It‚Äôs more centered around the average
very rarely will someone gain/lose 70+
<@145305657237700608> this suggestion hasn't been planned yet ?
I‚Äôd rather have a scale of set mmr lost based on rankings
not sure what you mean
Would it be possible in the future to set something like, dropping the players back to where they got picked from and be able to set multiple default channels? Or get players from multiple channels and drop back to  one channel after that?
technically its possible to just grab the required players from all voice channels
idk i never liked the idea of pulling people from a bunch of channels
since the point of the Queue channel is to make sure everyone is ready
is there a command for a player to replace someone in a match if they cant make it
/player sub
First player is gonna be subbed out second is one subbing in
yea, the problem for us is that people q and if the q takes longer they start playing or chatting, etc.  and some other people q and join the same voice channel (default channel) and it starts to get noisy and messy with everyone talking and doing something different at the same time if you know what i mean, so it would be a great solution for us if you consider it as a suggestion
./player sub is for admins, players can use /substitute as wel
Wasn‚Äôt sure if he was admin or player
yea was just pointing it out
All good
Assuming he was an admin asking for his server
My bad tho
Hello üëã we are still beta testing the bots and we have some weird issues, we can join a Q then speaking/writing channels gets created for the mach but when we join the vocal room,  nothing happens, it just wait indefinitely (not sure if I'm clear)
It was working fine 1h ago
whats the ID of the channel you are testing?
So this is where it gets stuck
969643748751462421 this is the id of #queue-21552
so it looks like you force started
but you are using the roles system, but at least one of the roles had no players
so it broke lol
Well it was working fine 1h ago and we were doing that as well
were you picking teams via Balanced?
Launching with an empty slot for a role
We changed that recently
We're gonna try with a Q with no role to see if it works
its just the way i coded it which breaks if there are no players queued for a role
ill add a fix for it
im an overwatch gamer so gotta help you guys out lmao
if you are looking to test, use /test and itll let you join multiple times
We'll try tht then
also your anticheat channel seems to not give perms to the bot
Bot has admin perm so
what is the anticheat system
weird it says Missing Access
maybe the channel is deleted
it just flags players who have new accounts or go on large streaks
okok
so you can manually review them
Is there a way in which I can manually report a game if people didn‚Äôt vote win/lose?
set a staff channel for the future or use /outcome
Yeah I got it thanks
Also when I add a map does it auto apply to all queues?
no maps are specific per queue
Ah so I have to do it in the specific channel for the queue I want right?
Got it sorted
Is there a thing where you can choose ct or t side?
there is no sides
too specific to a single game
you can specify a random host in lobby details who can choose the side
Fairs
All good
Actually is there a feature where I can make it so the first pick captain gets to pick the map?
Or does the map use everyone in the lobby to vote?
its either everyone votes, or its fully random
Ah rip
Need to get rid of my maps then
is there a way to give all the corresponding role giving the autorole condition
without them having to play a game ?
like force a "role check" ?
not currently, i can make it so that when you update the autoroles it checks all the players though
we're currently having issue with games starting with 4 players in each team instead of 5
since there is multiple queue with the same name, it appears there are some bugs when you leave one instance to go to another
it probably isn‚Äôt related to the queue name, more the fact they are keeping the role selection open
Maybe
Maybe you can fix it by closing all role selection when you join a new queue ?
i‚Äôll think of something, that would be annoying and hard
okok
I also had a problem yesterday where it wasn‚Äôt adding the players in the q to channel
So they couldn‚Äôt join vc or see the Channel where they had to vote for captains ect
probs was just a connection issue with the bot
the role issue was due to a high number of players queueing the same role at the same time
I'm new to the bot, a question, have any video with tutorial? Is it possible to create matches from any game?
there are not setup videos and no tutorials besides doing /setup
something i need to work on
Then can you teach me? I'm with some doubts, I did setup, in case I'm in doubt with mmr, what is this? Is it something from the game like lol?
mmr is matchmaking rating, every competitive game has it
some call it mmr, some call it elo, some call it sr
<@145305657237700608> will you be adding the feature I requested?
Seems like a few people may need it too
eventually, its not super simple cuz the match is stored via the winner message -> the channel -> the server
so its weird if the winner message is not in the queue channel
But I‚Äôve gotten requests from my players asking if the winner vote can be put somewhere else?
understood, but im the one who has to actually implement it lmao
its gonna be annoying af
Understandable I was just asking, but if you don‚Äôt want to do it then that‚Äôs fine
hey the bot isnt working anymore and idk how to fix it or if you guys are fixing it?
This interaction failed is what it keeps saying when i try to join the Queue
looks like my server host is getting blocked by discord
ughhhh
switching the bot to hosting on my own pc for now
Can you fix it or not haha
well its the fault of my host, i have to wait for them to get unblocked
usually its cuz for cheap hosting, they host a ton of bots at once
cant really do much
Wait so you‚Äôll allow it to host on your pc or not?
yea im running the bot myself
should be fine
How long until it‚Äôs fixed and can be hosted by discord?
its not hosted by discord, I pay a server host to host it for me
Yes it‚Äôs fixed
running locally lmao
Hahah
Any idea why this is an issue?
Happens sometimes when people try to enter all at once
He's been trying since last night
it's still the same today
<@504159788268126242> Inv me to the server
Is it still happening to him?
Yes, sorry. Trying to deal with tournament teams
All good
usually it‚Äôs an outdated discord version
Meaning they need to update their discord?
Okay, thanks
Will see if he can update it
It's already updated, he didn't need one & still having the issue. I'll have him delete & reinstall the app real quick to see if that fixes it <@145305657237700608>
have them try on the pc app or discord web if they can
Well, may not be possible. But I'll try.
by minimising the mmr gained would i be minimising the mmr lost in the process?
<@145305657237700608>
i guess it would be right? as it is a factor in the equation
yup it goes both ways
It's still not working, even from a different browser. He left & rejoined the server, too <@145305657237700608>
i‚Äôll be home in a few hours and i can try to help them out
also /link is broke
Did he try with the application instead of through a browser ?
Yep I noticed that, thought it was on my side only so didn't bother to tell you
nah i accidentally changed the argument from a Channel to a string
so it‚Äôs broke
You might fix it soon ?
how do i continue a queue in another channel?
What do you mean ?
i tried linking but it only mentioned that the application failed to respond
Yeah /link is broken atm
and anyway /link is only for /leaderboard and /stats so that's not how you create another queue
If you want to create a new queue you can /startqueue or /setup if you want a tutorial
so how do you link a queue in a current channel to another channel-
You want them linked by MMR ?
If that's the case you only need to have the same name on both channel "queuename parameters"
Like in my server I have 7 queue and they all have the same queuename and they're all linked together
yea, all stats are tied to the queue name
so as long as they have the same queue name
they are linked?
in terms of sharing the same stats system? yes
but even tho the stats are the same the configs are diff?
ohhh that explains why
thanks
Should I invite him <@145305657237700608>? He's done everything from deleting, reinstalling, and can only join queue from the browser
if he can join from browser, there isn‚Äôt anything i can do
that would show that it‚Äôs an issue with their client somehow
hello
our game finished and we cant put the score
Also same <@145305657237700608> we can't do winning teams
Feel free to blame me, i somehow deleted all running games a few minutes ago when migrating back to my host
kinda out of luck
and i cant even cancle the game
so its just stuck there
Oh boy...
gonna have to just delete the new channel
Can't do anything other than delete the queue
& I have to manually score games.
you can recreate the match with the same teams to select the winner that way
otherwise manually yea, soz
i just deleted the channel and now 5 players are complaining about it so i guess i have to deal with it
and thanks for your time man
classic elo goblins
never happened before, hopefully doesnt happen again üòÑ
hopefully
is the bot working correctly?
we're being moved in and out of the generated vcs back to the defaultchannelü•≤
how to put the level in the nick? For example:
[5] Rextilindro
Donate
what do you mean?
it feels like a bug after generating the voice channels and we be moved into them the bot starts to move us in and out of the voice channels and the vote menus are pretty slow (kinda lagging)
./ratinginname
we had this issue for about 30 minutes in one match (about 30 minutes ago)
its moving you back and forth
Tbf it would be easier if you just nicknamed yourself with the level
the bot can show your MMR in your nickname with /ratinginname
ex: NeatZ - [1000]
Yeah but he's asking about lvl not mmr or am I wrong ?
<@145305657237700608> I made you 2 donations of 5‚Ç¨. I don't know if your receipt.
appreciate it a ton ‚ù§Ô∏è
did you use the donatebot link?
Yes sir
weird it didnt pop up, but i saw it
Donate
This link
Maybe he donated for someone else but still no message poped up with the amount
oh maybe you didnt select your username
or that yea
Np as long as you have the money it's ok
You can tell that's a french dude speaking here üëÄ
how do u get the bot to pick a random overwatch map when it has chosen the lobby
you need to set the parameters /map selection type:random
But you need first to add the maps to the queue
If you wanna check which map he has in his list already you can check with /info (page 6 I think)
<@166210872807653376>
wdym ‚Äúhe has in his list‚Äù
do u mean the bot?
With /info you can see details about your queue's setting
and at page 4 you can see maps that you added with /add map command
those maps are perfect
do i just type /map selection type:random then for it to work?
Once you have added all the maps with map selection type:random it will pick it up through your list
aight ty
is there a way to assign roles to people based on their mmr?
its the auto roles function right?
yes it is
what if we have multiple queues?
would the auto roles apply to all of them?
or i do i have to set the configs separately?
its per queue, so yea you need to config them seperately
but you can use /autoroles copy to help
https://zachnieto.github.io/neatqueueweb/#/?id=automatically-assignremove-roles
<@145305657237700608>  So I am using this autorole role for a bracket system in my server, so if a person fall below the minimum rating, will his current auto role be removed?
Should do
so its not a feature yet?
If you set it up correctly and he fall below, bot will remove his auto role yes
Mk thanks
Yes it is a feature, depending on how you set it up or if done correctly then it should take and give roles accordingly
<@169813785144459264> do you know if neat end up adding the suggestion where people can‚Äôt see who‚Äôs in the current q?
no i did not yet
Are you going to or not?
Jeezz my words there made it sound rude haha
Not meant to be rude just asking
yea i might add it today
Also here is a better documentation link: https://docs.neatqueue.com/
its also in the channel description
Can you check your dms from me <@145305657237700608>
what happens if u delete the queue message from the bot
by accident
no one can queue, but /clearqueue will bring it back
aight ty
is it possible to make it so the same map doesn't get chosen twice in a row
like between two different matches?
yeah like after a map is done
the bot can choose the same map that it chose right before
so we are talking about after you got a random map, voted for the winner, and got another random map right
can u make it so it isn't the same map as last time, but still random between the other maps?
hmmmm perhaps
currently there is no concept of keeping track of previous maps
It's just kind of boring if you have to play the same map twice
we have enough ppl now so we can have multiple games running at the same time
but in the cases where we don't have enough players, it's just kinda boring to play the same map twice
yea makes sense
for now I guess you could turn on the map vote, but ill think of a solution
it's not that big of a deal really, but we have had a few instances of it happening where ppl aren't very happy ahahah
Hi <@145305657237700608> whats the point for /mmrvariance command ?
This is mainly to minimize the loss/gain when you should win/lose because by default it's at 800 :
- increase that number to minimize the loss/gain 
- reduce that number to increase the loss/gain
It means than actually a 1000MMR player who beats a 800MMR player should gains like 35 MMR or a 1000MMR player who loses to a 800MMR player loses 65 MMR ?
Depends on your default mmrchange setting
if you kept it at default (50) then in the first case the 1000mmr player will win less than 50 mmr so 35 but if you increase the variance it could be 30 instead, in the second case with a basic variance we can say he'll lose 65 but if you increase the variance he'll lose 60 (this is not the math, just pure explanation) variance increased minimize the number of points that are affected by the fact "he should win/lose"
with the autoroles command i have a few questions
when a player goes out of the mmr range set
does the bot take the role away?
at default its 50 or 800 ? lol
MMR variance is at 800 default
MMR change is at 50 default
another parameters
whats the differences i dont get it
MMR change is the gain/loss of mmr is a situation where everyone has the same mmr
You need to set up the rules for removing/adding role into the queue you want the role to be removed/added
if everyone is at 1000 mmr and they play against each other, they wil all lose/win 50mmr
mmr variance
is how much it varies depending of the difference between a player mmr and the mean mmr of the enemy team
so for example I have 1200 mmr and enemy team/player has 1000
gotcha ty
I will win less points
and lose more
is this enough?
is there a simulation to see the variance ?
like 800 by default seems to be 15 pts variance
there's the formula if you wanna try things with it
from experience
hmm idk it's hard to say
we spent like a good 30min yesterday tweaking it
the higher the value is
the less variance there is
okok
yea that‚Äôs good
and yea i‚Äôll update that formula to include that new variable
Now people that could join queue can‚Äôt. And if they are force joined, as captains they can‚Äôt pick.
i think the issue might be with the database running slow
Swedish translation ‚Äúthis interaction failed‚Äù
So just need to wait it out?
im not totally sure yet
This has been an issue for a while today?
yea <#857677776471588894>
lots of issues
is it gonna be fixed today?
<@145305657237700608>
likely not fully
Hey um
how can i help <@712539438927839252>
How do I create queues which doesnt cause players to gain/lose mmr
like friendly queues that does not use mmr
just make mmr change 0
do i just change the starting mmr to 0 too?
doesnt really matter starting mmr can be whatever you wish, just do mmr change 0 and they wont gain mmr when reported
mm mk
anything else?
is there a way i can transfer the configs from one queue to a different one?
<@914753310542688326>
/save /load
ohhhhh mk
thks
hey may I just ask a quick question, so when i loaded the saved configs, it changed my queue name to which the queue's configs i saved
so when i change the name of the queue from the saved name to a different one
will it still be linked to the queue whose configs i saved?
You can check to which channel your queue is linked to with /info
it's the first page
If you just loaded without changing anything you should have the "old" result channel that was linked to the Q you saved from
so what if i loaded and i changed the queue name?
If you rename channel it will take it into account
the fact that he renamed the queue to the previous one is a bug IMO
I also had this bug when I used save and load
but it just happens the first time
You can rename the queue channel and the bot'll understand
Just make sure you changed the result channel / staff channel if you use them
so i just need to change the result channel/staff channel, and rename the queue channel, and the queues wont be linked anymore?
the link between Q is the queuename parameters
But that's only important if you use MMR
oh i dont
in both queues
when i save and load it also saves default mmr change and starting mmr right?
Well in this case you should probably change result channel in order to have 2 diffrent channel for both queue unless you don't care receive result in the same channel
I assume it does but you can check it's third page
thanks for the help
idk how that happened
seems like the bot is lagging currently
will i get my progress and configs back?
yep probably
<@145305657237700608> seems like the bot crashed
It won't be removed dw
The bot crashed in our server as well
Damn this bot didnt crash anything for like 2 weeks
what happend recently?
<@145305657237700608> did everything reset?
like when leaderboard resets monthly and you have to vote?
Vote for what?
I had to vote as well to use the leaderboard
all my queues cleared and i have to redo all 9 queues with the settings again
it says no queue in this channel
yep no worries the bot just went offline I think your configs are still there but the bot is not
how long approx you recon?
till back up
No idea
i think even if you redo the queues it will crash again
i just did 2 queues and they crashed after
yeah i will wait and see what happens
welp
<@145305657237700608> busy day bro xD
i have no clue what happened, somehow the queue database just got emptied
Is that fixable?<@145305657237700608>
all the queues should be back if they existed before 2am last night
<@145305657237700608> i mean, our que still there it just says it doesnt exist in that server lol. I assume you got no idea how long it will take to fix?
General Lobby queue?
do we need to resetup all queues ?
Its back now tho
im doing one more restore
<@202076845615611904> your queues are back
Can confirm
it is
But is being funky again lol
whats it doing
We had 3 different Ques for about 1 min
Now its back to 1 que
right, i just did another restore
so it forgot about any progress it had
But we cant se our MMR points we had
Aahh okey
But why cant we see our MMR points or choose winning sides from games we played?
what do you mean
some users lost their mmr
Yep leaderboard is gone (seems like)
<@145305657237700608> Our points has reset
Did you do a point reset?
check again
leaderboard is back
<@145305657237700608> Points are back but I cant chose winning teams now instead
seems to work for me
The bot is prompting me with a link to vote for the bot when I try to make the leaderboard. I'm assuming I have to vote to get the leaderboard back then?
What server, if it is
IT just keeps saying this que dont exist in this server
when did you create them
That que happend rougly 3 hours ago
We are doing 1 more right now and i see if i can give points for that one
<@145305657237700608>
right, i restored a backup from 2am
so the queues after were lost
Aaahh okey
I think i know what happened
Somehow we got hit by a RansomWare attack

```
found this in the database dump
haha
he will leak the database
so sad
more so the fact that the database was deleted
so it cant keep happening
<@145305657237700608> I cant seem to pick winner in our server, it doesnt actually choose anyone
can you screenshot ? <@259383679527157760>
You get a video instead
It just keeps loading
its telling me the channel that corresponds to that game was deleted
Huh? This is a new one played literally 10 min ago
wait click it again
Still the same thing
you didnt delete any channel
No nothing been deleted
<@145305657237700608> So what can we do now?
try another match and see what happens
Alright
so  you guys never voted for the winner
Nobody voted
you can just click the winner message button then
dont use the admin one
2 AM from your hour which means 8PM for us ?
i think thats 8Am for you
probs gonna take the bot down around 3:30 for hopefully 5 minutes to secure to database
hopefully no other ransomware attacks in the next 3 hours lol
<@145305657237700608> Is there a way to reset the points for everyone?
\/resetstats all
thanks
Gmt +8?
We are london hour so he's right
Is there any way where people could join team channels to spectate
We found a way to do that but you need to trust people you wanna give this perm
Add them to the staff
./staffrole add
They'll have permissions to use bot commands
Yeah my community is a bunch of toxic kids so nope I'll just have admins/mods move them
But they'll be able to join match
100 they will abuse power
Well we could request that feature
Percent*
It's not a big deal
Just would be neat
No pun intended
I just suggested that feature, Neatz would have to agree about it and then you'll be able to upvote it in <#954499196629692486>
you can disable the channel restrictions totally
yeah but that mean anyone could join the voicechat then ?
right lol
Not a great idea IMO would rather prefer a privileged role which can bypass restrictions
true
so we should lock all queue while you're updating the bot ?
doesnt matter, people will be blocked from queueing anyways
okok
games that already started will be registered ?
if they are still running while the bot is down
is what players will see if they try to queue
yes, any match that is currently in setup will be interrupted and channels are deleted
any match that finished setup will be able to be voted upon after the bot comes back
how do I cancel a queue that started
like force cancel
Currently there is no force cancel, only  /cancel which calls a vote
must be used after teams are created
Ahh ya beat me to it neat ahha
you can use /outcome revert/tie to kind of cancel the match though
I was like getting all excited cause it was something I actually knew and then bang ya beat me lmao
is there a way to balance role queue lobbies more
bcus rn it‚Äôs kinda weird that the top 5 ppl (like 4.3k mmr ppl) get matched with people like 500 mmr under them
can i see an example
bcus the sample size is so low
and they gain so little/lose so much
bcus they are much higher ranked
role balance should be as fair as possible
than the lobby avg
not sure what you are saying
screenshots?
I think it's about mmr variance
The people with high sr lose a lot against lower sr people
this for ex
everyone who is above 4200 will just never consistently gain mmr
bcus there are 3900 players matching with them
bcus the bot takes the first 10 ppl who q up and put them in the same lobby no matter what
if you wanna change the variance in MMR distributed, use /mmrvariance
<@166210872807653376>
for example if you made it 5000, pretty much everyone would gain/lose the same
wdym
is mmrvarience the difference in mmr ppl have to be before they start losing differently?
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ue5labtkpv
its part of the equation and changes the distribution around the average mmr change
<@145305657237700608> problem in my server
Apparently leaderboard isn‚Äôt updating?
screenshot or @ me in the channel
I @ u the rank c chat
Whenever we start the game from the /defaultchannel we configured  the bot takes us to the new vc that been generated and when the match ends and we vote on the winner the bot takes us back and deletes the new generated voice and text channels it‚Äôs all fine here but once we start again sometimes the bot lags and get the players in the new vc with a time delay so players sometimes join alone without being moved by the bot and there comes the problem 
The bot starts moving us back and forth between the default channel and the new vc the bot generated 
Whenever we start and finish the game we have this lag issues so after voting for the winner with majority of votes 
The bot isn‚Äôt deleting the generated channel immediately but takes up to few mins sometimes never so i have to delete them manually 
Is there anything important I‚Äôm missing here or is that a bug?
here is the base configuration of our bot
We‚Äôre having this issue for few days now and therefore we can‚Äôt use the bot until this bug is fix
The same problem accrues on 2 different servers without any configuration updates so nothing was changed from our side to cause this bug
does it happen every time?
i haven‚Äôt seen any of these issues in any of the servers i‚Äôm in
Yes yesterday was the last time we used it and it happened again
We can test it out together if you would like to maybe I‚Äôm missing something there
if it happens everytime could you record it?
or/also /save the queue and post the config
here
Yea mostly in the 2nd time we Q when there are around 10 or more players in the default pick up channel
Sure I‚Äôll hyu whenever it hits again üëç
got a quick question, is there a command to set a timer to delete the new generated channels or is it default set to delete immediately after the match ends?
you can use /cleanuptimer to automatically end a match after a certain time
otherwise no once the match is voted for, the channels are all deleted
Is there a way in which I can only give my mods perms to certain commands such as clearing the queue or changing the outcome of a game
And not commands like changing mmr and stuff
not currently, the /staffroles are all or nothing
Fairs
<@145305657237700608> are u testing stuff or adding request?
yea im doing the lobbychannel stuff
you can see it in here with /lobbychannel
If i set a queue to Best of 5, it does, 1,3 and 5, but the 1 is undesirable, so how do i remove it
Is there a way i can set it so its 3 and 5 only
and is there a feature for auto roles based on leaderboard placing?
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/954499196629692486/973771533430427678 not right now but it is planned
So do I have to invite the neat queue beta bot for the spectate role
Do I need both bots
You only need the regular one
beta is for neatz's use only for testing here before going live
The regular doesn't have the spec command
You sure ? I just used it
One sec let me check again
It can take an hour to appear in your server
I see
I used 6 game roles and then I set the teamsize to 5, so I couldn't interact anymore, can't I make the team size smaller than the game roles?
Is there a way to create 6 roles, with only 1 player in each team?
currently the team size auto adjusts to match the number of roles
it‚Äôs kind assumed that if a team has 3 roles, then you have 3 players
roles are the same for each team, what are you trying to do?
Oh, I didn't know
But I managed to create a game with 3 game roles but with 2 in the teamsize, and it worked
the bot would‚Äôve just chopped it down to 2 roles then
when you changed the team size
No, he didn't cut
if you set the roles as A,B,C, then the teamsize is 3. If you change the teamsize to 2, then the roles become A,B
at least that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm pretty sure still happens
This did not happen, it was possible to choose A,B,C, but we only need to select two of the three available to start the match
Could I show you this?
well that would probs not be right
strange
i guess that works
That's it works fine with 2-3 game roles, but with more than that it doesn't
yea i‚Äôm not quite sure how that would work, it should adjust but maybe it‚Äôs broke
It broken is more useful than it right, being possible for more selection options without exceeding a limit
yea i could probably allow that
Well thanks for the support, you do a very good job.
appreciate it! no prob
can i configure this bot for a shooter game ex. crossfire
wanna put in maps randomize ques etc.
U can do it with maps ect
i tried it says start a que
Correct
/startqueue
yah it times out
kk i got this sorta down but do i need to be on everytime i wanna start a que
the old elo bot i used to have had a command =j where people join a 10 man que
and then it randomizes the teams and selects a map
anyway i can do something like that?
People can just chose random once 10 people are in q
You don‚Äôt have to be active for queues to be there
Just /startqueue and then it should stay there
Until you /end queue
yup, the key with NeatQueue is that queues are always running, and people can just click the button to join
no commands needed
I've been testing setup, only admin can create?
There is no way where players can create setuop, but without some resources like set MMR and Add MMR, is there any way?
Players can‚Äôt do anything with the queue other then /cancel it or join q/leave
And stats and leaderboard
If you want players to be able to do stuff with queues give them the staff role
usually the staff just creates the queue and the players use it
can‚Äôt think of a reason for players to create their own queues
Yeah and them being able to handle their own mmr and change stuff?
it's because some admins may be sleeping, at this time without admin to take care of everyone to create a queue, players would be waiting until another day to play
the queues don‚Äôt end though
so there is no need to create them over and over
take a look at <#915810764277817354>
I had forgotten about that thanks
no prob
what is this Channel Restrictions command for?
toggles if new channels have any restrictions to join
i can remove the command actually since it functions the same as setting /spectatorrole to everyone
this constraint does what exactly?
voice channels are restricted to the team by default
that command disables it
Hello, a few questions:

1) The /add mmr command doesn't seem to take an input for altering how much MMR to add. 
2) When you substitute a player in a current match, the player that gets substituted out receives the win+mmr, which I would've assumed the player subbing in would get those accolades

Thank you and using the bot has been a blast!
#2 should have just been fixed
yea currently /add only adds 1, you can use /set for more precision
i can modify /add to allow for an input though
Oki, 

To inform you, we used this command a few hours ago and it seemed to be off. Is there a way to remove wins/MMR from the player who was gifted the MMR?

Also, I will utilize /set, but /add having another input would be amazing

Thank you once again for the bot and the speedy responses!
which command seemed off?
The /player sub was the one in question - it allowed us to substitute Player X out for Player Y just fine. However, it awarded the win and MMR to Player X despite him being removed from the match/not playing.
^^^^
i meant like legit 5 mins ago lol
./add should have an optional argument for the amount
defaults to 1
Oh that's crazy, good to hear thought!
Awesome, thank you! You're super fast with the edits! :)
np, was super minor anyways
Hello again, 

When you set a /results channel, is there a way to deselect or remove the results channel? 

EDIT: I suppose I could just delete the channel itself, but I was curious if a bot implementation existed
The results channel by default is the queue channel
so by design you cant remove it
otherwise you cant see the results
Oh right, my apologies. What had happened was we used the command to designate a separate channel, then I realized I actually would have preferred it in the queue channel. I suppose if I delete that separate results channel, it will default back to the queue channel?
errr, i would set it back to the queue channel
it might break otherwise, not sure
Gotcha, thank you!

Also, is there an option to designate a separate leaderboard channel, similar to the /results channel command? We absolutely love the leaderboard feature, and I suppose we love it so much we would prefer it have its own channel :)
sure, just use /link from a separate channel and link to the queue channel
then the bot wont complain about there not being a queue running
Toggle off
Hello once more,
 
Is there an option to allow Captains to choose what maps to ban, versus simply allowing the entire lobby to vote on a map? Typically in R6 10Mans servers, each team captain (after teams have been formed/picked) will ban a map from the pool until 1 remains. Something along this format

- Captain 1 and Captain 2's teams are formed
- System randomly assigns Captain 1 the option to ban a map first, from the 7 available [A, B, C, D, E, F, G]
- Captain 1 bans A:
- Captain 2 bans B:
- Captain 1 bans C:
- Captain 2 bans D:
- Captain 1 bans E:
- Captain 2 bans F:
- **G is decider**

In most R6 systems as well, they allow the Captain who __did not__ ban the last map to also pick which side they want, whether that be Defend first or Attack first.
Thus, in this scenario:
----
...
- Captain 2 bans F:
- **G is decider**
- Captain 1 picks DEF, Captain 2 is left with ATK
there is currently no map ban system
this command is not working well "Cleanup Timer" I put 5 seconds, but the room was not turned off. it only works when I enter the call
cleanuptimer will auto close a match after the timer, the timer only starts once teams are created
does it close the private queue? I can still see
what do you mean close the private queue?
Closing the team room, along with the call, I only saw the call disappearing, the team chat continued
it should delete all the channels
if you put 10 seconds, will the created match be 10 seconds duration?
I got it, thanks man
yup you are exactly right
Does the "Draft snake or straight" command serve to catch a character in the game?
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=draft-type
I didn't understand the description :(
check the link in the docs
it explains them more
I also looked and didn't understand, it seems to be a pick to get character, but how does the command work in the room?
im not quite sure what you are saying
it effects the captain selection
its a draft
like change the leader every game?
I think I understand, a captain chooses player then the other captain chooses is it?
CAPTAIN (1) will pick their first player, CAPTAIN (2) picks player
<@145305657237700608> isn‚Äôt there multiple ways a draft can happen?
Eg let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs is 20 managers picking players 1st manager picks then once they get to the 20manager then they pick 2 players then whoever picked first becomes last pick this round
no, its only from captain selection
Yeah
Won‚Äôt make much sense haha
I don't know if it's a bug, but sometimes I put number of teams: 3 teams and I put team size: 3 players, but the bot understands how to add and it looks like this:
Can you /save the config and post it here
I just finished, I'm going to make another one just like it
JKMLU
If I try to put one player on each team, it won't
what do you mean
You‚Äôve lost me
I tried to put 1 player on each team, but he got 2 players on each team instead of putting only 1
the teamsize is 2
What‚Äôs this for?
of course you get 2 players per team lol
You have 2 roles specified
so it shows space for each role
since it can be either fre 2/2, fro 2/2, or fre 1/2 fro 1/2
This time I didn't put a role, but this happened:
I put number of teams 3, and team size 3, it was 0/9 Queue...
Try to put number of teams 2, hence the "Queue" was 0/6...
confused
that makes sense?
3 teams of size 3 = 9 Queue
2 teams of size 3 = 6 Queue
Why doesn't a team 1 and team 2 appear?
you would need /queueintoteams if you want players to choose a team
<#915812487826382930>
You are an angel, thank you man
<a:cat_kiss:926271726772453438>
<@145305657237700608> did you fix it so admins can cancel queue?
Or did you only fix the players /cancel
forgot about that, only players can cancel a match at any point
admins needs to wait until after teams are setup
but admins can cancel with /outcome
if you didnt know
Yeah I knew they could cancel I just wasn‚Äôt sure cause u said u fixed players cancel but yeah ok
Just to make things clear, only player involved in the current match can cancel it even though it's still setting things up ?
And admin can't ?
Players can use /cancel at any time in match creation OR after teams are created, which calls a vote to cancel the match
the admin version, /outcome cancel, can only be used after teams are created and does not call a vote, it just ends it
fixing it now though where the admin version works at any time too
k nice
k it works but ill update later
Thanks
<@145305657237700608>
Can you make a command or something that allows admins to let players off the mmr decay
If they can‚Äôt queue due to holidays or internet or power outage ect
Which has a timer on the command where you can say they have 3 days of no mmr decay and it will take it away after 3days when they are back or something
The "register" command asks for a link, what is this link for? I can see this link being from the staff?
sure
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=game-integrationsaccount-registering
Registering an account will set your MMR to the respective games MMR, if you do not already have an MMR
If there is no game I play, then the registry would not work? From what I've seen it only has 4 game with support
Thanks
right you can only select one of the currently supported games
Yes pls
That‚Äôs sick as
actually im moving it under /add instead of /set
but later
Is it available to use now?
Or not yet
should be
or will appear soon
Thanks
i'm setting up an R6 Pug server and have some questions about how to automatically set the starting elo when someone registers, how to make the winning vote majority and not just a single vote and how to make the starting game to start automatically without the need for a vote
<@914753310542688326> ^ who do I ask for support with these issues?
Just got a queue for my server I‚Äôll help you after üëç
no worries, thanks!
Yo sorry got off track
Can you ask those questions again <@211732383932743681>
If you wanna make it majority. /requiredvotes
Then chose what you want
just need some help getting the starting MMR to work and the voting number
I tried that but it doesnt seem to work
Hmm Inv me to the server I‚Äôll have a look üëç
Just dm me it
are you wanting players to register their MMR from their R6 account
got it sorted,
How does this "lobbychannel return" command work? tested but did not return to my team's voice channel
Set it up and then chose what voice channel you want it to drag everyone in the queue back to once teams are voted for.
For me it only shows enabled and disabled, it doesn't show which channel they should return to, with the lobby set I was able to, but this one doesn't return the player to the voice channel that was
/lobbychannel set
./lobbychannel return will return players to the voice channel they were pulled from before the match started
I don't know if it's because when the winner is defined, the team's voice channel is turned off, does that mean that when the winner is announced, we should go to that voice channel?
when the winner is selected, players will be moved back to their original voice channel
If so, would I go back to that voice channel?
not that channel since it gets deleted
Say you where in <#857677776471588894> and got pulled into #Queue-21323, /lobbychannel return would move you back to <#857677776471588894> when the winner is selected
So your original voice channel before you got dragged into the queue call it would take you back to that one. That‚Äôs what neat means <@806178698176626754>
Got it, thank you very much vahnala and NeatZ
<a:cat_kiss:926271726772453438>
The command "lobbydetails set" I can put any message? I saw HOST, QUEUENUM, PASSWORD, do these three generate an automatic message or is it just an example?
Yes, here is in depth details https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobby-details
shows an example
I read and didn't quite understand these three substitutions
Apologies if this is a known command, but is there a way to just remove a singular member from the leaderboard?
Just take their games away
And they won‚Äôt appear
What if they've already played like 5+ games?
Do you care if they have games added
Why do you want them off the leaderboard?
Well, I suppose I do care if I was asking. And my server wants to remove them since said members were banned for their actions
Yeah just /add games - however many they played
Copy, thanks
Is there a way to ping a role when a lobby is at 8/10 or 9/10 to get the lobby over the line?
Yeah
<@211732383932743681>
/autoping set then chose what role you want it to ping then number 8 or 9
players can‚Äôt also /ping the queue
can* sorry
Is it possible to edit roles permission for the bot generated voice channels?
For example 
Role SPECTATOR: always muted (if not in the current game/Queue)
or something like -/spectatorrole configuration  command to be able to edit the role more freely
not currently, its much simpler
the bot just gives the spectator role connect perms
hmm but how to fix such a situation when /Rolerequirement = role with permission to connect and speak and /spectatorrole with connect only 
There we have the problem that everyone who can que can watch and speak as well if they got both roles and that's what i'm trying to avoid 
What i'm trying to get here is that every player with spectator role who is not the current queue game can connect but can't speak
might make sense for me to either make the spectatorrole not have perms to speak in the channel
or make it toggleable when you set the role
Could even do like in the players queue channel a box of something. If people that aren‚Äôt in the q wanna spectate they can do /spectate and it will either dm them the code or put it in the channel selected
So after teams are created players put a code for game password and when someone does /spectate it will dm them the code or something
what is the code for
im just making the spectator role not have speak perms in the created channels
Like the code to join the private game
Is it possible to make a queue which just pops and shows who joined instead of making them vote for teams or anything like that
i just need it to pop when it gets to 10 people and then do nothing else basiclly
make teams still?
just when it gets to 10 people to show the names thats it, idk if thats possible with the bot tho
you can do /numberofteams 1
and it wont include a teamsetup or winner selection
oooh
whats the command for stopping a queue again? cant seem to find it
nvm got it
Is there any way to make the lobbies that are created by a queue visable to everyone but only joinable by those in game?
<@914753310542688326> <@145305657237700608> ^
<@145305657237700608> 
Is there a function that prevents people with MMR above the specified value from entering a queue?
yup, /mmrrequirement
/role requirement
Wait can you explain that again.
The voice channels that get created when a game is occurring are only visible to those in game, I want those to be visible to everyone but only joinable by those in game
i think if you edit the category and give everyone view channel perms, it‚Äôll fix that
the bot doesn‚Äôt hide the created channels (i think)
It seems to give a hidden role to those that are in game, and hides that, everyone can already see the category
<@145305657237700608>
we are talking strictly voice channels right?
Cuz if so, whenever the bot creates a voice channel it does this:

- Give the bot "Connect" permissions
- Remove @ everyone's "Connect" permissions
- Give the staff roles "Connect" permissions
- Give the spectator role "Connect" permissions and remove "Speak" permissions
- Give each player in the queue "Connect" and "Speak" permissions
the bot never actually manually gives out/takes away the "View Channel" permission
The "Outcome cancel" command is not working for me, only on staff channel it works, but I need to click the button, I wanted to use the command
did you delete the match channel?
or was it already deleted?
It turned off because of the cleanuptimer, do you need it open?
i realized that the bot wouldnt let you cancel/revert a match with the command if the match already completed, ill fix that now
but yes the bot was looking for the match channel, but that shouldnt be necessary
itll be fixed when i update, the staff buttons should still work though
<a:cat_kiss:926271726772453438>
Does the "reactionrole" command only allow windows emoji? I can't use animated emojis or emojis from other servers or from my server
I tried putting this one and it doesn't work <:Master:230383824771612674>
errr what does it say when you try
it lets me add a server emoji when i just tried it
what was the input?
oh, its cuz that emoji isnt from your server
so the bot cant use it
since you need nitro to use emotes from other servers
So my server has to have nitro?
no, since that Masters emote is from the Overwatch server, only people that have nitro and are in the Overwatch server can use it
since the bot isnt in the Overwatch server and bots cant have nitro (i think), the bot cant use the emote
I got it, I really couldn't use the overwatch one üò¶
you have to add those emotes to your server
since the bot only has access to your server emotes
<a:cat_kiss:926271726772453438>
hey yall, im hoping i can get some info on what all is possible with this bot <:happyspace:924421712555147284>
forgive me for my lack of knowledge, im new to bots on discord
when creating a queue, can it be one general queue (regardless of teams) and is it possible to assign lets say 2 people to the queues by default?
Would take me years to explain what this bot can do!!
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobby-details
Everything the bot can do and the admins can do is in hereüòÜ
General queue? I‚Äôm not understanding can you explain more?
The assigning 2 people to the queue by default I couldn‚Äôt answer as im not sure. <@145305657237700608>
whats the best way to set this up for valorant customs
/setup should get you most basic settings you want
i‚Äôm not sure what that means exactly lol
is there a way to make it balance teams using ranked roles
like discord roles?
./balanceby roles
or use /startingmmr to specify the MMR for each role
i would do the second one probably
The command "resetstatsall" if I put the name of the queue, does it erase statics from that queue or from the whole server?
just for that queue
so any players stats with that queue name
Starting a thread for types of setup videos/guides to create
I'm trying to understand the "ratinginname" command, but it's really hard, what is "$"? that appears so much
have you read the docs section on it?
it gives a better description and some examples
I read but got confused by some things, does this command "ratinginname removeall" disable all MMR on the name side?
yes it removes all ratings in name
I have an issue where someone is unable to register with an ign or join queues
<@145305657237700608> Is there any reason that my /ign command would stop working? players for some reason cant join anymore
<@914753310542688326> ^
I have like 5 players wanting to sign up and a lobby with 8 in that are trying to get going but cant ahha
Tbh I‚Äôm not sure
I‚Äôll look
<@211732383932743681> yeah I‚Äôm not to sure, that‚Äôs a <@145305657237700608> question
Yea I tried setting the requireign command to false but that hasnt seemed to work
so they can‚Äôt join the queue cause they haven‚Äôt sign up?
they get an 'interaction failed' prompt when they try
it seems to give them the roles as if they have MMR
what is the command that allows me to see someone's MMR?
Just /stats
Is starting mmr set
And also are their discords updated?
I am getting them to do that now
it gives me an error when i try to use the stats command on them
What‚Äôs the players names that u wanna see the stats for
Ned and Lagic
apparently thair discords are up to date
is it just for two users it doesn‚Äôt work?
I'm trying to make a 5x5, but the game has six functions, I can't start the queue, because the bot doesn't allow it
6 functions?
what‚Äôs a function
COMMAND:
SUPPRESSOR:
SHOOTER:
TANK:
SUPPORT:
KILLER:
oh a role
usually you need everyone role to be filled for a game
idek if forcestart will work if not every role is full
I can't use forcestart, because no one can join the queue, a message appears in red saying that the interaction failed, after I try to join a team
oh that‚Äôs a bug on my end
i can‚Äôt fix it right now
it‚Äôs angry cuz you can only have 5 buttons at a time
but you have 6
<:PepeHug:872506496750071848>
gonna have to make it 5 roles or wait until i fix
I'm trying to put "ratingqueuename" and when I add two queues they add up, not showing one next to the other, I used the ","
what is your format?
have to put? I tried now to put the "$", but it didn't work very well
if you want two ratings, you need the format to have two $s
Is it normal to be like this?
well your format is current: $s
so yes that makes sense
if you want two mmrs in the name, do something like: - ($) ($)
the docs go into more detail about how you can set this up
I got it, sorry I didn't understand the command very well after reading it, thanks NeatZ my angel
<a:cat_kiss:926271726772453438>
<@145305657237700608> It appears so, though it seems to have happened before
usually it‚Äôs an issue with a users discord being out of date
but can‚Äôt confirm without working with the user really
I've just had another person not be able to join q
their discord is up to date
it gives them the rank related roles but does not allow them to join any lobby
it also doesn't allow me to see thair mmr
<@145305657237700608>
it‚Äôs something with the autoroles
did you set autoroles for something and delete the role?
Ahh maybe
i‚Äôll have to fix that possibility
check your /info page 6 and see if it loads fine <@211732383932743681>
the role i deleted doesnt show up on that page
welp it‚Äôs still probs the issue
remove that autoroles
I have, though the role doesnt exist so I can't put it in the removeautoroles comand
that‚Äôs true‚Ä¶
that‚Äôs an issue for sure
Is it possible to wipe all auto roles from the system?
autoroles are per queue, so if you delete the queue yes
i might have time to fix the issue tomorrow
Ahh, though wont that remove people's MMr too?
nope mmr will stay
you can recreate the queue
actually if you /autoroles copy from a queue with empty autoroles itll reset them all
or if you /save and /load the same queue the autoroles should disappear
I seem to have fixed it
I ended the queue and remade a completely new one
makes sense
shouldn‚Äôt be hard for me to prevent that in the future
thanks man, is there any way to allow players to duo q?
duo queue is not released yet sadly
ahh is it going to be anytime soon?
i‚Äôm away for a week so not really
no worries, but if you're looking for feedback, that is the one function my players are constantly asking about haha
Don't have a command where only one person can vote? example only the staff vote?
you can change /requiredvotes
you can‚Äôt make it staff only currently
could add that
the "startfromvc" command is not working for me
was the voice channel empty?
seems like it
or not
I had entered the "Vazio" voice channel, I made the command and created a chat and a two voice channels, then I put my two accounts in the respective team channel, however this error appeared where it does not appear how to define the winner, it does not work on the staff channel to decide the winner
how many people were in the vazio voice channel
when you typed the command
2 people, I put teamsize 1 and numberofteams 2
there was 2 people in the voice channel?
hmmm that‚Äôs strange
When I enter the channel, it appears that it has already been deleted, this in 1 second
How does the "team selection type" command work? I don't know what unfair, player pick, random, captain and balance is 
üò¶
it‚Äôs just how teams are selected
Unfair for what is it?
the most unfair teams possible
best players vs the worst
Can you rename team1, team2, team3 etc.? I only saw with create team, but need to create a team and the team already comes with a captain, wanted to have how to change the name of team1, team2 after finalizing the command of setup, is it possible?
no you can‚Äôt customize team names yet
I tried the random, but I don't understand, it still appears team1, team2 for the player to choose, random wouldn't it be like the players click join in the queue and automatically the players are mixed?
if you have /queueintoteams enabled then the team selection doesn‚Äôt apply to your queue
since the teams are already decided
got it, thanks NeatZ
<a:cat_kiss:926271726772453438>
That command "tempchannels" where the text channel is created? I didn't find anywhere
huh?
I read about the command, I didn't understand what it does exactly, does it create a text channel when players will start playing? like /setup auto text chat?
it creates the new text channels for each queue that fills
not a great name/description i‚Äôll admit
like this?
it‚Äôll create a text channel with the queue name and yes those messages will all go there
for the balance by roles
is it
1 = lowest rating
20 = highest rating
20 = lowest
1 = highest
Lowest rating is the lowest a person can go in mmr
oh kk
so does balance by roles affect the captain selection for 2 highest rated?
I‚Äôm not to familiar with the balance by roles
balancebyroles order is lowest rating to highest rating
But I‚Äôd assume that the auto role that is attached to the mmr would even it out.
now that i think of it it doesn‚Äôt impact the captain selection
different thing completely, the bot doesn‚Äôt use mmr when creating teams
Oh ok
it uses the role order
I see
Like the roles in the discord?
Not how ordered with bot?
I just assumed that it would go by if they had autoroles setup it would go by those roles attached with mmr to make teams fait
either the default role ordering discord, or you can specify the order
autoroles still works with both systems
so you are correct still
if you rank up and get a new role, that gives you more priority
not because of your mmr, but because of your role
<@145305657237700608> I modded Vahnala in my server so he could help with bot issues that arise. Without speaking to me, he overturned bans from banned players and tried to hide it by deleting the welcome message when the banned player returned to the server
Not the best look for support people to be doing...
<@145305657237700608> 
Is there a way the leaderboard could be linked to a queue name rather than a channel?
not currently, you need to link to the channel with the queue running
Mk, because if i set a required role for a certain queue configs but under the same name, a person will not appear in the LB, which makes it problematic for checking the LB and autoroles.
hmm that‚Äôs true
so you want like a server wide leaderboard
so it doesn‚Äôt hide people who aren‚Äôt the required role
I am sorry if i have inconvenienced you in anyway
no prob
you could create another queue channel with the same name for now
and hide it
does it affect autoroles?
I assumed it would because players are hidden on the lB**
if you made a new queue with the same name everyone would be on the leaderboard by default
so autoroles for lb arent affected?
not quite sure what you mean
I am just confused over autoroles for the leaderboard. Is the autoroles for the leaderboards linked to a channel or a queue name?
Hm nvm i have an idea
autoroles is set for the current queue
doesn‚Äôt effect anything else
mk thks
<@145305657237700608>
so i want to add rank roles to the bot so that way when a team wins, they can earn a role if they have the amount of points for it
that would be /autoroles
to assign roles based on MMR
ok thank you, i will be back if i have more problems or questions
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to look at all the roles i added?
so if i were to do `/autorole added` i can see all the roles i added plus the amount of mmr needed to reach each one?
that command isnt there but its an example
it‚Äôs in the /info
oh ok thank you again
um this doesnt really show me the roles i added
i only added one so far atm
page 6
where do i find page 6
which command
you should see buttons to scroll
oh ok ill check
thank you again
also is there a way so we dont have to scroll up and join the queue
<@145305657237700608>
the queue message will stay at the bottom
oh ok thanks
<@145305657237700608> is there also a way to change the amount of mmr for everytime you win
like if i wanted to make it so queue 1 wins 20 mmr and queue 2 to win 30 mmr
yup /mmrchange
oh ok thank you
<@145305657237700608> theres no registration in your bot right, anyone can join the server and start queuing up right
correct unless you enable registering
And or if role requirement is set
<@145305657237700608>
which part means mmr?
Team N - Average MMR (estimated MMR gains)
<@145305657237700608> how can i make it so i dont go negative in mmr
and also, how can i set the mmr to 0 for everyone
<@145305657237700608> i need help with the mmr portion
can you please join my server to show me how mmr works
Set the mmrfloor to 0 that‚Äôs the lowest mmr a play can go
And then set mmrceiling to what your max mmr will be
so i created this system, let me show you
the **w** after the numbers means wins and the **l** means lose
so 0 would be the mmr floor right
and 10k would be mmr ceiling?
Correct
so how would i make it so after winning one game, i get 15 mmr
and losing one game i lose 5 mmr
<@914753310542688326>
I think you can only set it to one
Like only set the mmr change to what you want
can you explain this part
is there a way to change the amount of mmr you get per game
/mmrchange will allow you to change the mmr given and lost each game.
/mmrvariance will allow you to make it around that number, I‚Äôm not to good with math but you‚Äôll need a mathematical calculator to figure out the mmr variance
you can‚Äôt make the wins mmr change different than the losses
it‚Äôs all the same
with reaction roles, how do you add a new reaction? it keeps saying the emoji I want to use is not a valid one
Is it an emoji or a made emoji from a server?
<:monkaW:976227202918133841>
Its one that I wanted to add
<:Playstation_logo_colour:981010908904062987> <:Xbox_one_logo:981010893510934548>
these two
You should be able to add them unless their not yours
the emotes can‚Äôt be from other servers
they need to be either normal emotes, or added to your server
since the bot doesn‚Äôt have access to emotes from servers outside of your own
I added them to my server but they still dont seem to work
nvm, got it
ill add that bit of info to the error message for the future
how do i disable this asking
<@145305657237700608>
you cant currently
ill add that
ah ok ty
I've had a couple of games today in my server where the queue chat is made and the teams are selected by captains but the team chats aren't made and they get stuck in queue chat with no team chats
Weird.
Definitely a neat question
thanks, I thought it was a pretty good one too
He‚Äôs asleep so yeah, probs be atleast 4 hours until he will respond.
<@211732383932743681> Could you /info your queue and show us ?
Autorole LB
Isnt automatic for me
Does autorole affect a channel or a queue name?
autorole effects the channel
iirc this is nothing that effects a queue name
it‚Äôs all tied to the channel
except for some settings which are tied to the server
Ohhh
So if i set an autorole to one channel
But there are elo gains in another channel
Under the same queue name
It wont work?
correct
Mmm ty :3
it‚Äôs by design that all queues are separate so you can have a ton of different set ups
but that‚Äôs why /autoroles copy exists
to copy the settings
<@145305657237700608> wb autorole topplayers? Does it affect one channel or a queue name
same thing
Oh mk
is there a way to require a minimum of 5 votes for a team for winner selection?
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to make it so that winners gain MMR at one amount and losers lose it at a different? I.e. winners gain at 60 MMR change, losers lose at 30 MMR change
how big is the team size?
no, the calculation is the same both ways
does the command "/reportbug" send the bug to you or is it to my server?
it goes to my DMs
Team size is 5
so 5 would just be half right?
use /requiredvotes half
Shouldn't the "logs" command be only admin can access?
yes it should, that‚Äôs an over site on my side
How does the "teamnames" command work?
just specify the team names you want as a comma separated list
Team A,Team B, etc
<@145305657237700608> currently even if I do majority it requires 6 votes but if one team has 2 votes and the other team has 4, the bot gives it to the 4
I am having issues with one person voting for themselves at the start and then the other team capitalizing by voting for themselves
and regarding the MMR difference for winners and losers, is there any hope to get that changed? I am trying to do a double MMR weekend but everyone who loses loses the same amount as they would win so it just evens out
So your Saying they are voting for winner straight away?
Delay the winner vote message
So it doesn‚Äôt send the message straight away
/delaywinnervote
if people are intentional voting for the wrong winner, you should probably either kick them or ban them from queueing
as for  creating a seperate win mmr vs loss mmr, thats something I could look into adding for sure
I'd greatly appreciate it if you could. Because I like the idea of doing weekend events where people can earn twice as much MMR or a bonus for winning during the event
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to make the MMR appear in front of people's names?
/innamerating
Infront of their names
Umm not sure about that one
no it‚Äôs only the suffix
<@145305657237700608> how do I make it that you can only vote after 5m
Thanks
But specify for what? I didn't understand the goal
team names?
names of teams lol
What‚Äôs happening with the bot <@145305657237700608>
Saying interaction failed
think my host is rate limited
lets see
hosting manually for now
now that i got it, thanks Neatz
<a:cat_kiss:926271726772453438>
Wait is the tourney thing out yet
Lemme check
It is
How does it work
i cant use the stats feature, its asking for a vote but we already voted
That happens to me sometimes
i think you just have to ask someone else to do it
that usually works for me
you have to vote once a month
per server
tournaments are not released yet also, i‚Äôve got the integration down where players can join, admins can create and start them, the matches just aren‚Äôt hooked up
the last time i voted was about 2 weeks ago, and is asking for another vote, so i voted again but nothing changes
correct, they reset at the start of every month
also
the voting is broken cuz my host is broken
let me disable the vote requirement
my bad
oh, ok
forgot about that lmao
try now
it worked
Hi! Is there any way to restrict the /leaderboard command for admin only? Thanks ‚ô•
not currently
you can‚Äôt change who can use commands ‚ô•Ô∏è
Just put the leaderboard in a channel and then not allow people to type in there. They can just refresh it ect
true good idea
Thank you‚ù§Ô∏è
ohh thats fine!
Thanks ‚ô•
Problem
Is there a command that will stop games from automatically being tied if they aren't voted on/scored for a while. (Admins do it, we get busy with life)
thats the /cleanuptimer
or you can disable ties
Okay, thanks. I wasn't for sure if that command did it
How do I disable it??
For ties use /ties
For the automatic match cleanup use /cleanuptimer
wait so clean up ties the match right
how does mmr decay work
oh nvm i understand now
clean up timer basically ties the queue?
does the mmr decay occur even when you are an active user?
or only if you have been like afk
<@145305657237700608>
mmr decay is only reset after you complete a match
so if you complete a match your mmr wont decay?
<@145305657237700608>
correct, the timer resets again
mk tytyt
hello again, how can i change the team names in the results? it seems when team names are changed, it changes everywhere except in this message.
Also, are your API endpoints public? i mean i can access for example the leaderboards but it is intended to be public? or you may change in the future so only request from your website will be allowed. I pretend to use this information to also display it inside the game server, so the bot is fully integrated.
are there any docs for your api?
Sorry if i'm being overwhelming, but i think this has great potential in my community, i could not find any public repository of your bot where i could make pull requests (i'm not a discord bot developer but i'd be happy to help where i'm able to).
Can you run multiple ques at once in the same channel? Say I wanna do a 5v5 and that 5v5 fills up and starts will players be able to que again or will you need to wait till the current match is over.

Is there a way to give a role once players have linked their accounts via /register ?
Once one queue fills it will have another queue ready/remove everyone and take them to the queue that popped
So no u don‚Äôt need to make another queue
Thanks, now if I wanted players to start off with 0 and gain 5 each win how would I do so? Or is that not possible. Been messing around with these commands it seems that players get 1000 off the bat.
/startingmmr
Set that to 0
And then to gain around 5 each win/loss
/mmrchange
I've done the MMR change command but I must be doing something incorrect what is the proper format?
/mmrchange
Will allow u to change what they gain each win/loss
Give me a sec
At school
All good, no rush
/mmrvariance
Must be set according to what your (mmr change) is.  If the mmrvariance isn‚Äôt right it won‚Äôt give them the correct mmr each win.
You will need a calculator to find out the mmr variance
Whats the calculation for figuring out the right variance?
I‚Äôm really not sure sorry. That‚Äôs a neat question that‚Äôs all I know about it.
I haven‚Äôt even done it myself cause i don‚Äôt know it
I see
I'll mess around with it, seems like it is my issue right now
Use this calculator <@368130512516153346>
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ue5labtkpv
not currently, the player and server stats are publicly available though, i would be interesting in adding more too
current the bot isn‚Äôt open source, might change in the future, who knows!
i must‚Äôve missed this part, i‚Äôll fix it tomorrow hopefully
you can give a role when someone queues if that works?
the first time they enter a queue, they get whatever role
Is there a setup command for that?
or should I just change the role name that is created
you can use /autoroles and just make the range like -10000 to 100000
Gotcha
since it‚Äôll assign that role since their mmr will be in that range always
actually, when players register it‚Äôll give that role too
since the autorole calculation happens when you register
so that should be perfect
for mmr variance is it the higher the variance the lower the loss?
<@145305657237700608> bot die ?
yup great
alright im swapping hosts today lmao
how long is going to take the host swapping ?
hopefully 15 seconds
oh ok üòÜ
is the bot down rn?
seems to be fine
i see you are having an issue with /outcome
our voting buttons are broke
I tried that
Can I just delete the channel
somehow that channel says it doesnt have any matches
im not sure how that couldve happened
all good just wasn't sure
Same issue here, I'll try creating a new channel and queue
what happens?
when you finish the match it doesn't let you vote which team won
and i tried with the /outcome to choose a winner and it didn't work
try again right now?
Let me see
i meant if you had an issue currently
that you cant vote for
Sorry bad english here and I dont understand:c
no worries
is it fine?
Yes, now it's fine. I'll let you know if tomorrow is fine too, when there's more people in the sv
Thank you!
Why can‚Äôt we score any games anymore?
Is the bot broken?
<@145305657237700608>
what happens when you try?
does /outcome selectwinner 30508 2 work for you?
it should, im dumb
fixing now
This works
just hotfixed the buttons
both should work
Doesnt work yet
you mustve deleted the channel that the match was in
if the winner message is deleted, you cant vote for the match
ill add an error message for that
Neatz do you help with server setups?
Sure im bored rn
sweet as!
can i chuck you an inv?
sure
This new "webhook" command generated a token, but I don't understand much about programming, I read the docs and didn't understand, does the game need to provide an API?
i wouldnt worry about it unless you intend on building your own integration/plugin
the token lets me verify who the requests are coming from, and lets you verify that the webhooks are coming from me
Forgiveness, i got confused <:PepeCry2:918155150936375297>

What is this app's name? to use the webhook, on the right side
postman, lets you manually build requests to test apis
The bot is crashing, I can't do setup, "setup" command bugged
im not seeing any errors
you need to reply to the message the bot sends for it too work
ahh probably, the bot can‚Äôt read your messages anymore
when i tried the setup the first time, i literally had to click reply on the discord mesasge the bot sent with my response for it to work
makes sense, replying doesn‚Äôt need the same permissions to read normal messages
i‚Äôll have to apply to resolve that
got denied again, not a good enough use case for the bypass
for now you have to just mention the bot for a response
What‚Äôs this for
./setup
localhost is your own computer
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=endpoints
just change localhost:2000 to https://host.neatqueue.com:2000
you want to send the request to my server, not your local machine
which is what localhost means
also you leaked your auth token which means anyone can pretend they are you lol

yea i should add that in the description of the embed
Also the bot is crashing discord for ppl
when they leave and join vc etc
that can‚Äôt be related to my bot
<:monkaW:976227202918133841>
yea if that is happening thats out of my control lol
try to update discord
bruh i still dont get how the webhook thingy works üíÄ
dont mess with it if you arent a developer lmao
its useless if you are doing in manually
if you are creating an integration, ill help you out though
ok i wont touch it first then
For example:

Create a plugin for your game that lets you receive the match number through the webhook
Players play the match and a team wins
Use the API endpoint to automatically select the winner
That way nobody has to vote for the winner, its all automated
I dont think my game supports API lmao
probably not
apparently source games let you
or if you are a game developer
welp i am not a game developer
sadge
<:Sadge:969970256460263545>
some of my queues randomly break after a while, like not doing anything when it hits the limit (even allowing someone to join multiple times), and giving a no permissions error if i try to change a setting despite working perfectly well before and if i create a new channel it works perfectly fine
any ideas?
if people can join multiple times, make sure /test is disabled
are you sure nobody in touching any perms on the channel?
im the only admin
also if seemingly nothing is happening when you queue/when the queue fills, it could either be:
- The bot in general is having an issue or restarting
- Your channel is ratelimited for too many updates
its done this in 3 different channels
the queue itself disappeared as well and i cant start another one because it doesnt have permission
not quite sure, the bot doesnt actually ever modify the queue channel's permissions
do you have a broken channel still?
is there a cancel/end queue command?
yes, /endqueue
any admin command requires manage_channels perms
so you dont need admin
only that perm, or a /staffrole
<@145305657237700608> Can I ask you questions in dm? about that webhook command with API
sure
hi so im trying to use this bot and the setup stops at the team size and doesnt work.
you actually have to either mention the bot or reply
i forgot to add a message for that
i see
it didn‚Äôt actually work for the queue name either, it‚Äôll set the queuename as just ‚Äú‚Äù
we were stuggling
yea my bad
if we need anything else we can just ping u yeah?
we are kinda slow sometimes
for sure lol
alr sick
just make sure to use /queuename if the name doesn‚Äôt pop up in the queue message
since if you didn‚Äôt reply, it‚Äôll be empty
and might break‚Ä¶
alright
yo <@145305657237700608> can u help us with something rq
having some issues
in support vc perhaps
can‚Äôt hop in voice right now but what‚Äôs up
cant really put it in words
can u join our server and help setup
wouldnt need to vc
sure but you will still need to describe it lol
<@456226577798135808> is neat helping or you still need help?
he helped
we got it all down almost
working on ranks and other shit
Let me know if you need further assistance if neat isn‚Äôt available
<@145305657237700608> yo, is it possible that we can hide the points in the que?
hide points when
So when we picking players and in that que you can see everyones point as captain, is it possible to hide so captains dont see the points?
not currently no, i figured the points are helpful for picking fair teams
It would be if the players had brains, but the players in our server dont lol
Neatz, I have contact with my game devs, does mobile play work?
basically anything works
<:yes:915010011317559330>
is there a way to have the bot auto drag to the queue vc?
yup that‚Äôs /lobbychannel
use pull all
<@145305657237700608> is the bot down?
apparently
Okfy
its back up, strange
ran out of memory
grrrr
Oohh
<@145305657237700608> Is there any way to donate to you other than paypal? unfortunately I can't send my little help
well you can let me know if you have any ideas lol
hopefully not gonna run out of memory again but who knows
Can you add a credit card option?
not through donatebot
i‚Äôll have to build my own system using stripe probably for when the premium version of neatqueue is released
donations can be through the same system
i‚Äôve had people cash app before
or donate crypto
Is there a way you can reset the MMR for everyone then one person at a time?
/reset stats all
First of all, have a good day everyone!
Is there a possibility to know how many parties/teams have already been created and define a discord role for each player in the party? (role name the same as the party).
thanks.
Not currently actually, there isn‚Äôt a way to view all teams, but i should add an admin command for that
thank you
I've never found a bot as amazing as this one, ty
<a:great:879802243782701116>
<@246325905771855873> just to let you know it will take them all back to the starting mmr you set. On top of resetting their wins/loss ect ect
appreciate it! i‚Äôll add that stat to the /serverstats
Also <@145305657237700608> can another party see another parties members?
If you do add that party name role it could be /team and than optional (party role name)
yea /party view
Heyo, i go to my dashboard and it is just blank.
the online dashboard actually doesn‚Äôt exist anymore ever since i started refactoring the website
everything has to be modified in discord for now
how do i do that?
well what are you trying to do?
i want to set up something tbag is like a competitive mmr game
ranked sorta?
can i dm you?
sure but you can get additional help here too
for the most part /setup is all you need to initial setup
<@905848508614074379> anything in specific u need help with?
how do i reste mmr?
/resetstats
it resets all stats, not just mmr
how do i make it so it drags people to the vc
Using /lobbychannel will drag people to and from it automatically
and then drags them back
cool
<@145305657237700608> do you know why when you test q and join it multiple times when the queue pops and you join the lobby call it says lobby cancelled due to inactivity?
it doesn‚Äôt recognize you joining the voice since you joined before the bot started waiting
only effects test queues
So join not straight away?
Join a bot after?
just rejoin
sometimes you are just too fast
"Save" command is not working
you are right, i broke something
<:PepeHug:872506496750071848>
How does the "details lobby" work? I tried to put the same as the docs, but it didn't work
this password, what does it do?
it will randomly generate when a match starts
What do I do with this password?
you can use it for creating a private match if your game requires it
Is the "number of lobbyes" command working? I'm not working with me
hmm i guess it‚Äôs messed up with roles
i‚Äôll add that to my list of things to fix
how do i stop the bot from making a text channel once teams are picked manually? i turned the vc channel off but the text channel keeps coming. i want to keep the queue'd teams all in the same text channel it was manually picked in
turn off /tempchannels
how do i minus mmr
Disregard
However i made a manual queue and a regular draft queue. When i try to look up stats it says there is no running queue. Why?
you can only look up stats in the queue channel or a channel that is /link to the queue channel
since you can have multiple queues
What does this "flag vote" mean?
It means they didn‚Äôt actually chose the team that won
<@914753310542688326> <@145305657237700608>
did you disable voteforresult?
No <@145305657237700608> it just disappeared before we could finish the draft
what disappeared
also /save your config and post it
When i do save it says application did not respond.
oh right it‚Äôs broken
whats your server id?
813606919914127371
i copied your settings and had no issue
oh wait actually
its cuz your /resultschannel was deleted
i can add a fix for that so it doesnt break
should be fixed
also /save is fixed
so waht do i do
Ok i saved it
do i do /outcome and put the winner from the 2nd draft now?
the old ones wont work
they are fully broke
but any new games will work
wait if i put them on teams with the manual draft channel i made
it should work?
and just put the winner
yea if you setup a match yourself you can simulate the result
they r lucky i played in the draft cause if i didnt i would say tough
but i do want my own mmr
lmao
fair
is there a faster way to add names instead of doing /player add 1 by 1
not currently
was thinking of adding a command to easier simulate a match
how are you friends?
I have a problem, could you help me?
When clicking on the queue button, it is giving this message
"'this interaction failed"
I've redone the queue, created another text channel and it's still like that.
click it again real quick?
yea thats what i figured
there is a bug in the /partyqueue or /teamqueue in selecting your team to queue
unfortunately cant fix it right now, so you will have to avoid teams
I tested in all the queues, and it's giving the same error
yea, you will need to disable team/party queue
one of your teams got glitched
I left everything configured and left the queue closed, until the members entered discord, I gave unlock now to test and this error started
try now, i just hotfixed
Perfect NeatZ
just one more doubt, I can't delete a party, it says the captain can't leave.
"You cannot leave party Clanzao since you are the captain!"

another thing, shouldn't the option to choose the party appear in the active /teamqueue mode?
you need to /party disband if you are the captain
yes unless you only have 1 team
sorry, I expressed myself badly, the option to choose the team, shouldn't it just appear in /teamqueue mode?

I say this because when I enter /roles mode, it asks if I want to choose the team or go solo.
it will appear if you have /party queue or /team queue
found a bug, Solo Queue shouldn‚Äôt appear in /teamqueue
it won‚Äôt work, but still
i had a issue that i fixed but i dont know how to set mmr to what it would of been for both teams (or how to calculate it)
not quite sure what you mean
so one of the people in my server didnt join the call that was made after we all queued and it didnt run out of inactivity even though it was enough time then he rejoined and it the bot went offline on my server couldnt use any commands or anything, i thought it crashed
gotcha
but the match didn‚Äôt start right
it didnt start that is correct
so what are you trying to fix exactly
im not sure tbh, i think i just crashed the bot on my server only idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  i havent tried it since
the bot is back up
it was down for like a minute a few hours ago
if something seems to break it could be related to your server only tho
did it go down earlier? ohhhhh unfortunate thats why lol
cause a couple hours ago it occured
it didn‚Äôt go fully down but it probably disrupted your match
gotcha, thanks imma try it again but not tonight as im on watching tv. Btw awesome bot truly I thank you so much for the fact it is free, and really great job!
appreciate it! the bot usually doesn‚Äôt have any issues, i think the last interruption was like 12 days ago or something
gotcha, i was using it for rainbow six for about 2 weeks on someone elses server so i decided to make my own and gotta say really easy to setup üôÇ
Hello !
I could use some help
Im trying to set up the bot for 5v5 League of Legends
InHouses / Customs
If ANYONE can help on this
Like hop on call or DM
please message me
its REALLY important
thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
<@197182414571831296> I‚Äôm available to help
Want me DM ?
Or ?
You free for a call ?
<@914753310542688326>
Dm would work better
Okay Ill fully explain what I'm trying to do with it
and the issues im getting
<@145305657237700608> we need help very badly
This happened
Also I then tried to set the teams to random now balanced and it did this
I‚Äôm ripping my hairs out rn
we're donezo'd
guess we gotta wait for the maker to help
thanks alot though
Unless the bot breaks cause I know he said something about it being hard to do big lobbies cause it didn‚Äôt work but I don‚Äôt know
When he's up
Hopefully I can get an assist
can you /save the config
saved
<@145305657237700608>
If you want to DM i can explain to you exactly what Im trying to do
and the issues im running into
im around till about 12 PM EST
thank you so much for your time it means alot
if the queue has 3 or more teams and i select the "2 Highest Rated" for captain selection would it just take the correct number of captains to teams?
or is a multiple team snake draft even possible?
Yes oops
everything works with any number of teams
ill re-label those to match the number of teams
nice thanks üôÇ
When i join the queue the MMR doesnt appear on my name, im the owner of the server, is it possible it cant change my name? (permission issue?) or is there something else i have to do to set it up
correct, nobody can change the server owners name
thanks, i figured that was the case, ill make it work another way then. Thanks!
I fixed that i used another account to take owner ship, so i have a dedicated account to manage the server and a player acct, on another note my /setup doesnt work it gets to this part (attached below) in the making of the queue then doesnt notice the number
you have to mention the bot
otherwise it can‚Äôt see your message
i forgot to add that detail in the setup message
discord made the change for privacy reasons so not all bots can read every message
ahh i see
what do you mean by mention like a @ mention or reply cause when i try @thebotname 5 for 5 per team it says invalid command
oops yea reply
not mention
cool thanks
The "lobbychannel pullall" command is not working, the match is canceled due to inactivity even though I was placed on the queue call
are you using /test?
you‚Äôll have to leave and rejoin when it automatically pulls you
the bot waits for all players to join normally
it‚Äôs weird but it‚Äôs just from testing
It worked, only in test mode does not work
as long as it pulls you, it works
i‚Äôll update testing mode to auto start from it
I'm taking this flag all the time, even in 1x1, I don't know why
in a 1v1?
hmm maybe it‚Äôs flagging people who didn‚Äôt vote
what is your requiredvotes?
half? majority?
majority
so both people need to vote?
yes, but when a person votes, the game already decides the result, flagging the other player
it must not be a majority vote then
right? it must be half
or one
or test mode
do you have test mode enabled?
test mode only requires 1 vote
so the requiredvotes wouldn‚Äôt matter
either way it must be flagging people who didn‚Äôt vote so i‚Äôll check that out
It was test mode, it works again
"Rantingname queues" command is not working, this queue not active message appears
the queue name is hello, seems you inputted hello $
correct, your queue name is hello
so just input hello
Okay, it worked, thanks NeatZ
<a:cat_kiss:926271726772453438>
The "party create" command is not working, even though I disable it for the queue, all players can still create teams
sure you can always create a party
that‚Äôs by design
And how does the disable option work?
if you disable party queue, you can‚Äôt enter the queue as a party
you can still make parties though for the future
Got it now, sorry for the mistake
no prob
<:ServerAccess:970113766207393812>
i transfered ownership to my other account and when i queue the mmr still doesnt show even though the bot can manage me.
did you fully enter the queue?
the nickname change is one of the last things that happens
yea i even fully started a game
not sure then, there must still be some blocker that makes you higher than the bot
gotcha, im working on figuring it out
Hi. I‚Äôm getting invalid team number error when adding a person to team 2. But adding to team 1 doesn‚Äôt have issues.
oops i‚Äôll be sure to fix that in a bit, thanks!
Does this command "/lobbychannel set" work for all queues or just for queue I'm currently using the command?
This button is not showing the learderboad
just the current channels queue
and what does the leaderboard normally look like in that channel
Is the "link command" working? I tried and nothing came up
what do you mean nothing came up
Sorry, I thought the learderboard automatically appeared in the room, but it's manually
correct yea
this time test mode is off, same thing happened as before
what was the match number
not sure, cant replicate it
you wont get flagged for voting against the majority if you didnt vote at all
is there any way to change the number of teams without everyone in the queue being removed?
yup /numberofteams
when i do that it empties the queue, at least in test mode
oh right, yes any command that changes the queue size empties the queue
alright thanks
Hey! The party queue system doesn't seem to work when both party members try to queue the same role, it says "interaction failed"
i saw you were having issues, try again?
it doesn't make a lobby now ://
something is bugged with parties i guess, lemme see
yup i found one bug at least, would just disable parties for now
its a bit sketch with role queue
actually try again plz lol
just hotfixed something
Thanks a lot!
It seems to be working now
with partyqueue enabled?
right now yes
meant for when you try starting a match with people from parties
which is what broke before
it's broken again
did you ever try it earlier lol
can‚Äôt debug anything for like 5 hours
sorry it was working for a few games
just disable party queue for now then
then it didn't work for 1 game
but it seems to work again now
sorry for the inconvenience
no probs! sorry for the issues üôÇ
Any idea why it broke this game ?
my idea is likely with being able to enter your party in the queue with too many of the same roles
so the bot breaks in trying to find fair teams
I don't know why it keeps warning
i‚Äôll check it out again
i would just clear the users
does it happen every time?
i found the bug...
is the bot down?
<a:3880lit9:896197745822564394>
Most likely.
back up
<@145305657237700608> the bot doesn‚Äôt work
We can‚Äôt Join qs
what happens
Wait
is it just you or everyone?
you can also invite me real quick to try
<@145305657237700608> "Automatically Assign/Remove Roles" work fine?
The "reset status" command is not working
the what?
Still with status, even if I reset
you still have stats?
there's still me resetting
looks like the default stats, no?
Pattern? should i delete the mmr?
not sure what you are saying
when you reset stats, it resets everyone to default
which looks like it did perfectly
I put mmr to the queue, if I reset the status, shouldn't people come back with mmr of 1000 for this queue?
correct
So it didn't work, the player continues with the mmr that should be deleted
any proof?
that screenshot shows them at 1000 mmr
I have 3 queue with 1000 mmr by default, if I reset to all, then shouldn't players have 1000 mmr for each queue?
all 1000 mmr by default, but when I reset the player's status, he remains with 1000 in one queue, but in the other he remains with 50 and another with 40
oh you are talking about the nickname
toggle the ratinginname off and on again
to refresh them all
Did not work
whats ur server id
882830712087134308
that person somehow has a different format
use ./ratinginname removeall
and toggle it back on
did not work
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
wrong command
<:PepeCry2:918155150936375297>
hmmmm makes sense since their nickname doesnt match the current format
idk how that is possible to happen
Do you want to test the command on my server? I can't erase
is it just that one user who has the wrong username?
sure invite me
How did you do it?
whats the common to have the bot set everyone to there INGAME mmr?
like to pull their MMR from in game ?
Someone got tileted and left in the middle of a ten man, I want to give the win mmr to the winners but also no make the losers lose mmr for that game can that be done
not currently
you would have to manually give the mmr
yessir
depends, which game are you talking about?
Rocket League for now
you can use /requireregister and /register
which will try and fetch the rocketleague mmr for the given profile you provide
okaie thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Its telling me im already register and when I do a stat check its still set to 1000mmr instead of ingame is there anyway I can fix that or I have to change it manually?
if you already have an MMR, then /register won‚Äôt override it
Okaie that make sence, Is there antway I could also fix the leaderboard? Its not fully loading up and only showing the main page of the websit
what does it show
sounds like it couldn‚Äôt find your profile
shouldn‚Äôt have said that though lol
oops im sorry
I didnt know üò¨
what did you input to the command
to reset or the /register one?
register
/ register "link"
wait you asking what link I give the command to or am i being slow rn
yea the link you provided
am i allowed to send the link in the chat or do you want me to send it to you personal
sure either works
Hi guys
who can help me set up NeatQueue bot?
sure whats up?
<@701693970266325082> is neat helping or do you still require assistance
is it possible when you finish voting you can force people to join a VC so it doesnt DQ anyone?
if you use /lobbychannel then yea you can either force everyone to a specific VC, or return them to where they came from
I‚Äôm going to bed. Watch it I always go to bed just before everyone needs help then I wake up and it‚Äôs all been sorted ahha
Shows majority of your servers aren‚Äôt from Australia haha
Or maybe Australians are just extra smart and don‚Äôt need help with the bot ü§î
Definitely first option, Australians aren‚Äôt smart ahha
most the servers I see are US and EU
so not surprising
<@145305657237700608> did you implement the one that you put in features request already?
Well in planned features not feature requests
yea the autorequeue?
yes its implemented
What‚Äôs the command
/auto requeue or some I‚Äôm assuming
no command, it‚Äôs the default behavior
I see
Does it re queue the people that joined the vc waiting
anyone that was ready and in the VC get put back in
Pre cool
so they don‚Äôt have to requeue
Maybe you could do something when it says queue has canceled due to inactivity it will come up with a would you like to automatically go back into queue and they will react to it
nah since it‚Äôs already 1 click to get back into the queue
this just skips a single click
adding a question would defeat the purpose
Yeah tru
Hey there!

I have a quick question regarding the queue bot. I have been running it on my server for a while and wanted to configure it properly for once, so I went through every command there is.

Now I'm in a state where a queue can have 10/10 players, but the bot doesn't react, it neither pings all players, nor sets up a new queue, nor shuffles teams for me. On a second server of mine, it works perfectly fine. 

Does anybody know which command I used to blow everything up? If not, is there a way to reset the bot to default settings? Kicking the bot and re-adding it to the server does not work. Could this entire thing be permission related?
let me take a quick look üòÑ
try it again real quick?
same issue
i see your prob
one sec lemme fix
Oh ok haha, thanks! üòÑ
apparently its trying to create a channel with a limit of more than 99 people
that's wild
maybe cuz of your spectator role/staff role
but ill just cap it to 99
I'm fine with undoing whatever I did to solve the issue again ü§£  I wish there was a reset option to put that thing back to default <a:PU_PepeBlessPray:859789804358074409>
if you set a spectator role to a role that has alot of people, that would be the issue
same with a staff role
oh alright
but either way im fixing it now
ok ok üòÑ
Yeah we're talking about a spectator role that includes 600+ users. In reality, all I wanted was that anyone can just hop into the channels and spectate, so I took our default member role as the spectator
should be fixed now
but yea idk if the system I have is good
since it just increases the user limit for the new channels to include all the people with the spectator role
The bot itself is amazing, ngl
that sounds a bit scuffed ^^
lol exactly
and yes, the bot functions now üòÑ
cheers man!
Having abit trouble with the bot
Can‚Äôt see match results in the set channel
Can‚Äôt cancle a match in the match chat
what happens when you try?
whats the channel id
All the matches it does this on the new server I setuped
it says missing permissions
specifically for your queue channel
cant send a message
Another quick question:
Is there a way to use the entire MMR system the way it's intended, but hide the elo entirely from all users? I'm mainly talking about the winner panel, where it shows updates on player's MMR after voting for results
And a second question:
Is there a way to disable the /leaderboard command for average users? We don't want anyone to be able to see any sort of elo, but want the elo to do its job üòÑ
not currently
/stats and /leaderboard are fully visible to everyone
same with the winner vote results
why do you want to hide mmr?
You can disable command usage in your server's integrations though
so you can disable using /stats and /leaderboard
All we need is a system that allows our audience to play the game with fairly fun and equal lobbies. We are strictly against a way for players to compete for imaginary points, but want to make use of the benefits of fairly balanced teams üòÑ
i see i see
i can probably add a argument to /mmrchange that lets you hide it
give it a shot /mmrchange hidden:True
I have used the command, will report back when I can prove if it works! üôÇ
i think I got all the places where MMR or MMR changes are visible, but let me know if I missed something üòÑ
Hey sorry for another question, is that feature you just shipped by any chance ripping the winner vote for the players?
no the winner vote is still there
if its not, thats either `/delaywinnervote` or `/voteforresults False`
Alright. I must've misread something on our server. My bad. If there's a bug, I'll report back. I haven't been able to confirm if the feature works just yet.

I shall thank you a lot for the quick support <:PU_Prayge:852823912521662505>
np and sounds good <:Prayge:848738134786572348>
You're a champ, it works flawlessly üôÇ
When using /purge on an ongoing queue and its channel, people who are in a game currently are kept hostage in that game because the bot requires the winner vote to go through. Any attempt to cancel the game or give it a result yields a "could not find winner vote. Has the message been deleted?"
(in that config, multiqueue is disabled, which is required for our setup)
you ran /purge in a match channel?
I did indeed
oh no, well i should make it skip the winner message I suppose
Am I hardstuck again or is there a user-fix? üòÇ
whats your server id
sounds like it might be hardstuck from that
<@456226577798135808>
sure, <#915812487826382930> is using /queueintoteams
Sorry didnt see
<#915812742865231912> is using /roles and /queueintoteams
Yes but i put /queueintoteams
And show like this
<:PanelDeAnalistas:988159168512946277>
try it again real quick
doesnt look like its enabled
Hey pls help.
After a q the bot shows no leaderboard.
are you using /leaderboard?
try again right now
so i can see what it says
It isn‚Äôt taking any stats.
have you played any matches?
which server, Rank B+
doesnt look like anyone has a completed match
Alr we will make a random q then check.
How can I get the rank to Show B+
your rank updates after playing a match
but its just a number
Alr.
How do I change MMR distribution.
`/mmrchange` has all those configs
What do I do for variance?
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=mmr-change
there is a calculator
default is 800
I just want people to lose 10 MMR and get 10.
`/mmrchange mmr:10 static:True`
Honestly the goat bro.
Like we needed a server coz 6Mans ZA is not managed right.
You have saved us.
i feel like i tried to get them to switch to NeatQueue at some point lol
cuz i used to try and get people to use the bot
6Mans ZA?
i thought, cant remember
How can i create
A queue like tjis
This
`/queueintoteams True`
`/numberofteams 2`
`/roles Tank,DPS,Support`
and how can i put
Queue manager?
Like this
On a different channel
that‚Äôs /staffchannel
no but i like that idea, any suggestions?
could be an insta loss with the mmr penalty
also you can‚Äôt leave the queue if you have /tempchannels enabled
so if you are having that issue i would suggest that
it‚Äôll create a new text channel for the match
and instantly empty the queue
so it‚Äôs impossible to leave
can‚Äôt leave once the match starts
which is when all players join the voice channel
if voicechannels are required
after the point that i said, you can‚Äôt leave the match
you should give it a shot to see what i mean
yes you can use `/queuesizeoverride` for that
and yes `/forcestart` will let you start at any number of players you want
the cooldown is only 3 mins i think
it should match the other voting requirements
./requiredvotes
How can i put leaderboard into different gamemodes?
uhhh what do you mean?
How does some leave once it had started?
if you have /tempchannels disabled
you can leave the queue when the match is setting up
Oh ok
<@145305657237700608> can you fix the player was removed from the queue Dm
Cause you know after like 60min you auto get removed from queue
U said that it‚Äôs supposed to dm them that they have idled out of queue didn‚Äôt u
how come one player can q more than once?
Cause test is enabled
Do /test again
That should fix it
pls help bot says need 1 to vote winner after changing to majority,
and doesnt wait for everyone to join lobby.
I Create a queue and put the command "autorole" the name of the roles is "NEW", the role is 1000 mmr.
If I use the command "Set mmr" for a player and give it 1200 mmr, then use the command "Resetstats all" for the player, does it still hold the "NEW" role? because I put 1200 mmr set for it, or does it reset to 1000 mmr?
turn off /test mode
it should remove the role iirc
is it broke?
Is there a way to have it forever? I wanted a player to win a role and even if the queue reset he would still stay in that role with the MMR of that role
it might actually
let me check
looks like you will keep your roles
Is there any leaderboard button to add someppl has leaderboard bug
And doesn't show anything to them
you need to have completed a match to show up
Its show like that
Show no leaderboard
even if you do /leaderboard again?
It‚Äôs never worked we talked about this haha.
Was talked about in DMs
I think it's something with your own settings and being able to see embeded messages
In that case you prob won't see the Q hub also
It's in your own settings "Pictures and Text" I think it's the first setting
Nvm it's the fourth one
<@456226577798135808> <@857633321064595466> <@914753310542688326>
A good thing to add to autosetup Q is a message "do you see the black square above" Yes/No and you explain that the bot works with embeded messages and that you need to toggle the setting on otherwise the bot is weird imo
errr not sure what you mean
that sounds right, people have had issues with it before
The dm from the bot doesn‚Äôt work
you have it enabled?
i didn‚Äôt even realize in the photo that all the embeds are missing
good catch
Just a quick Q, is the bot able to dynamically rename the channel based on how many players have checked the queue? Is there any way to visually represent the amount of users in queue if renaming the channel is not an option?
I swear there‚Äôs something like that but I‚Äôve never used it so not sure of the command
yes, /channelname
although beware if only updates twice per 10 minutes
that‚Äôs the discord api limit sadly
yes, set a /staffchannel
you have an example?
i might‚Äôve been updating the website so that could explain it, was working on the dashboard last night
what‚Äôs the link?
reminds me i need to fix the mobile website lol
hmmm, it looks like your queue name is nothing
lets see
thats the wrong link
https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/994766555822948482/994766556288532481
ill fix
would be interesting to do though
but nah
the link in /stats is just wrong
i forgot to put the /leaderboard part in the url
Got it, I forgot the command "startingmmr role" sorry NeatZ
the link in stats wont until i push my next update
the one in /leaderboard works
haha yea the title
uhhh which page?
like the website?
yea i cant see a way to show that in discord, too much data
could make it so on the leaderboard, when you click a player you see their in depth stats
Is there a way to make the waiting time before q cancels longer?
The 5 minute timer?
agreed
not currently, i can add that as an arg to /lobbychannel
May I ask where tf did you learn to code so good.
currently in college still, but also working fulltime as a software dev
ive learned python on my own though, which is what the bot is written 100% in
(except the website duh)
Alr.
I wanna learn to code like that tbh.
you should try, it takes quite a bit but its fun (to me at least)
i do this in my freetime lol
and work...
For a college student this is beyond amazing.
thanks! discord bots can be great ways to learn to code too
since you can easily interact with it + the discord api wrappers are easy to use
NeatQueue uses disnake.py
So like in order to do the 5 minute timer thingy what will you need to do?
ive added it but wont be available until i update
`/lobbychannel timer`
Alr.
When will you update?
uhhhh in a few hours
Alr.
ive got some refractors i made that i want to test before updating it all
if you are saying showing stats on the website, no
thatll be more work
yes thats fixed
was the winner selected yet?
yea the leaderboard got messed up 1 min
its back now
did you change the channel?
looks like it complaining the channel doesnt exist?
turn off channel restrictions
with /tempchannels, yes
did it just not work again
what is your /resultschannel set to?
its on /info page 1
^^^^
thats the /resultschannel
it shouldnt break either way, but that channel got deleted
what does /info show now?
yea that should be fixed then
ill implement a fix myself that will default to the queue channel for normal results if the resultschannel is gone
./info still shows the channel?
Hi I have a question, is there a way to disable the requirement to join a voice channcel after the teams are made? I'm just using the bot for 1v1 purposes
yup! use /voicechannels
thank you so much
was this before you voted this time
i didn‚Äôt change anything since the last time
well if it works nice lol
i figured it should‚Äôve worked
the resultschannel only has the rematch buttons
the staffchannel has the modifiable result buttons
both are restricted and cant be used by everyone
rematch is only those in that game, staffchannel is limited to people with manage_channels or a staff role
I'm using the bot and it's literally amazing, just one issue:
when someone finishes a match and they requeue to a 1/2 queue, the mmr ratings are off. One of the players' mmr is represented as the mmr before their last game as opposed to their current mmr
Could there be a fix to this?
haven‚Äôt heard of this issue before
oh like you enter queue before your match finished?
if they cannot type then no
since they cant type any commands
oh from the linked channel
forcestart currently only works in the queue channel
yea i can add that
you can also automatically forcestart
but it wont be updated until tomorrow probably, i accidentally got my IP ratelimited so I cant test lol
for sure
if someone joins/leaves the forcestart vote is cancelled
errr more so interrupted, idt it says anything
you know i forgot about that
thats a bug for sure
looks like im not ratelimited so i can fix stuff
looks like its from people with animated profiles
does that match with what you see?
hmmm so its animated pics and something else
for sure
i fixed animated pics, not sure what else it could be
nvm i got it
just updated
looks like everyone has pics on the leaderboard?
i think transparency caused some pics to be the wrong format
so I just force them all to allow alpha
plus animated ofc
was broke
nah it‚Äôs after the match finishes, it only happens sometimes tho, not too big of a deal
also the mmr system is kinda weird, in the matches people get, the lobbies say they‚Äôre gaining like 30 mmr if they win, but when they win they gain like 70
the estimated MMR gains dont include any multipliers
which makes it weird for if its a 1v1
oh i see
there are multipliers for placement matches and for win/loss streaks
placement matches is the big one
depends on your mmr change settings of course too
that‚Äôs what i assumed, was just making sure it wasn‚Äôt bugging out lol
i could probs make the estimate closer to reality but
i personally think it‚Äôs fine
do mmr changes start getting slimmer as more matches go on?
yes only the first 10 games get placement multipliers
is the entire formula except for the fact that the middle section only happens if games_total is <= 10
pretty cool
the first part is
it‚Äôs on a delay of 3 minutes
its on a delay cuz you only really want to forcestart if it seems nobody else is joining
`/setmmr ‚Äô
Doesn‚Äôt work.
<#992610856904957992>
bot was down for some reason
Can‚Äôt reverse score
you can only modify results via the staffchannel or /outcome
it would have to switch to sending a new queue message instead of editing
if thats what you would want
did the timer stop?
it should do that
that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm confused
i updated last night with that fix <#910981294937210930>
np ‚ô•Ô∏è
they should both use the same cooldown, so if thats true that is a bug for sure
yea something broke
maybe i didn‚Äôt actually push the update
i‚Äôll check tomorrow
its 1 week after your last match
so its calculated per person
correct itll keep decaying forever
/compare might be similar
this should be fixed
same with the messages not deleting
uhhh, even though Wins and Losses have their own rows?
+ winrate is there
ahh so more of a head to head comparison
who wins against each other more gotcha
i could add a new stat for that, currently not tracking it and it would be inefficient to calculate it everytime by looking at all previous matches lol
its easy to keep track of, would be annoying to have to go back and recalculate the head to head values for 40k matches though
not too annoying, but annoying
nvm not doing that since it wouldnt obey any stat resets, ill just start keeping track of it
maybe ill keep track of for each player you play with/against:
- wins with
- losses with
- wins against
- losses against
that should give everything we need for a h2h and other stuff like best teammate, worst teammate, etc
in the future
interesting idea, might be too confusing for people to understand though
snake is definitely better than straight draft for sure also
i wonder how this system holds up with more than 2 teams
sounds interesting
give it a try, /drafttype hybrid
correct, the streak is not preserved
i dont really think its possible to fix, since you could change results from 1 year ago, so it would be incredibly annoying to recalculate your correct streak
ive got these added, will updated later
sure just updated
oops lmao
i always forget about that
and of course i tested with ints
<@145305657237700608> I only had Africa Timezone options
start typing
its an autocomplete
For AEST what would I put?
Australia eastern standard time?
i assume so
ill make it so the defaults are more common than Africa lol
Ok let me try
Lol thanks
I saw only Africa as options and I was like well
i can pick 25 common ones to display
Australia, then like a few from US and yeah
Btw how do I pick if I want it to be 20:05am or pm haha
there is no am or pm in 24 hour time sir
Hmmm
So did I just type it wrong?
Should it be 10:05?
depends what you are trying to do
I just wanna test it to see how it looks and does when it hits the lock time haha
It‚Äôs 8:06am for me currently
then set the time to be 8:07
Oh what lol
to lock it in 1 minute
It didn‚Äôt lock or am I just dumb
set it for like 2 mins away
<@145305657237700608>
Didn‚Äôt work again
Unless that‚Äôs just me
oh im dumb
hold up
LMAO HAHA
Knew I wasn‚Äôt that dumb hahah
wait hmmm
Hmmmm
i was saving the time without converting to UTC so the time was losing its timezone
ok ive got it lemme update
try now
Ok I‚Äôll try now
<@145305657237700608> all good it worked
sweet
Haha
nah was gonna let it collect some data first
Did you fix the MMR issue I was having and Is there a way I can set the bot to text after someone after few mins then after ever text?
which issue
and i have no clue what that second part means
second part means when someone text in the channel the bot immediately respond with the Q so I asking is there a way to slow down the bot responds when that happens and the issue was linking your ingame account to the bot
so you can have the same MMR from ingame to the bot
what game
its a 3 second delay also
could think about making it customizable
RL for now
is there a way to make it customizable if not be a nice idea to do so if its possible
if its too spammy i would suggest disabling sending messages
yea should be able to
havent found a RL api i can use
just sent an email to pysonix's api access email so we will see
whats the command for it
and okaie sounds good I dont mean to bug you about it if i am didnt know if the command got updated just wanted to check before trying to work on it again
no i mean like  thats a good idea  to add
Oh myb I miss understood the text lol
Why is the bot not working? When will it be online again?
<#992610856904957992>
<@145305657237700608>
Boys down and hasn‚Äôt come back up
It‚Äôs been an hour usually not down for that long
Bot still Down?? <@145305657237700608>
Yeah
Won‚Äôt be fixed for another 5+ hours atleast. Neat is asleep and I‚Äôm unable to access his end to fix it.
RIP, I had active players looking to get into lobbies
Sorry for the inconvenience, not much we can do about it currently he can‚Äôt watch it 24/7.
Yeah
Yo, We cant q in our server.
Server: Rank A+ and B+
bot is down atm
<#992610856904957992>
<@778216176689348618>
ive identified the reason for the downtime
forgot to say but its been added, /timer queuemessage
a player's name is refreshed when they re-enter queue
ill add it so that this happens automatically when their name is changed
actually I cant since we cant know whether to use the nickname or real name
since thats a queue config
READ THE ANNOUNCEMENTS
its probably discord themselves tbh
not sure but this is insane
On discord side it‚Äôs all functional
I check their status thingy
im not sure
when i run with <@&974183361209856043> on my prod server its all fine
its like <@857633321064595466> is being ratelimited
my queue just went back up for my server, idk why ill let you know if it occurs issues. Your bot is a verified bot correct?
at first i thought it was the prod database but its running fine when <@862441990247284736> uses it
so my server and database are totally fine, its just an issue when NeatQueue connects
cuz NeatQueue-Beta is fine
hmmm weird, i just tried to use the stat button and it blew up and said application did not respond... idk weird
i found the fucking issue
i enabled receiving presence updates so we can tell when a user goes online/offline as part of the AFK kick feature
but forgot to realize that receiving status updates for almost 400k discord users would absolutely spam the bot
am going to cry now, g2g
well at least you found it, i wish you best of luck as i bet it wont be fun...
its fixed
i just disabled that feature
itll never work
too many people to watch over
fair enough, thanks so much my server is getting more and more people, at 200 currently grows so fast. So once again thank you for your time and effort!
glad you can grow your server and community using the bot, sorry for the issues though!
its hard to test the <@862441990247284736> vs <@857633321064595466> sometimes since the scale is so different, gotta get used to it though
thats why the issue wasnt on the beta bot, its only in like 2 servers
ahhh i see, well at least you have a development branch now üôÇ that really helps with reliability.
Yea ive been testing on the beta bot for as long as NeatQueue has been a thing, but hard to account for how things will work at scale
since there is a big difference in 1 server using a feature vs hundreds
true, question since the bot stopped being rate limited, my people in my ten mans cant seem to enable mmr.
it died again apparently
don't worry Neat, let me fight the bot.
ILL FIGHT IT TOO
he cant win
bro WTF is happening
no idea, my server is doing one ten man, and the only thing that didnt work was the mmr button for some reason.
Enabling vs Disabling MMR?
In the team selection
it worked it just didnt say that it worked
what language is the bot in?
python
oooo
is there anywhere i can apply to be a dev for it?
the bot isnt open source currently so not really, if you were pretty experienced I would think about it though
programming since i was 13, started with java in a class called "intro to computer programming" then took AP computer science, still doing JAVA, then took IT acadamy at my school for 2 years doing python
dont really have real life experience other than class projects
very nice, not currently working on any features but ill keep it in mind
he is also russian so +10 to computer skills
thank you kind sir
HAHAHAHA
apparently i need help with keeping this damn bot online lmao
ran out of memory
great
damn that sucks how much ram u have?
only paying for 1gb
i use oracle cloud and i got 24 gbs for free on a virtual server
aint no way you get 24 gb of ram for free
yea, it is arm architecture, but for general use it aint bad
https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/

I hope this ok putting in this channel, i dont mean to clutter support with this. but this is the general info
How do I reset MMR
yea no worries
reset stats with /resetstats
i could show you what i use neat if you want üôÇ
Thanks
yea i probably need to swap hosts or upgrade
im not super familiar with swap space but i have 4gb configured but OOM killer still hits me
question are discord bots allowed to run on arm processors?
i would assume but also we kinda need the CPU power
4 ocpu cores for free
swap space is when u run low on memory it creates a temp file and uses that memory
looks like this for me
on the website
i know, but it doesnt work lol
its always full even tho my swappiness is super low
thats wack
my bot doesnt use 5gb of ram
its like the swap is full for no reason
memory leaks
hmmm
swap space is fine because most the cached items are not used
I guess I could just add more and see
if you ever want to hop in a call, and i show you my hosting provider, cause no offense 1gb of ram is unfortunate
its pretty standard for a VPS
for $5 a month
fair enough, for free i get 4 ocpu cores servers hosted in ashburn, 24gbs of ram, 200 gbs of storage for free, only downsides for me is Ampere Processor, which limits type of executables, for instance steam
hmmm maybe ill try it out
maybe try it out for the beta in case it ruins the whole bot
well yea i have to try it first but the beta bot uses barely any ram since its not in any servers
yeah 2 servers right?
how tf does it run 711 servers with 1 gb of ram
thats just crazy to me
it really doesnt have to do much
in terms of ram, running queues and all doesnt impact it
i see
i havent made any discord bots yet so im fairly new to that
The ram is mostly taken up by the fact that every single member in every server is cached
along with the server itself
fair enough
I personally havent used python much, is it a single thread process or multi thread?
should be single lol
its basically single
neat you should check out our server based on your bot
also limited to a single core
its actually sick
what proccessor does your hoster use, like is it for instance a AMD Threadripper (ridiculous imagination)
just some basic ass cpu
are you running ubuntu? if so what cmd did you use?
cause i can pull up my processor stats 4 u
yea its lscpu
ill set it up rn and see
where tf do you see the cost
there is none you just make an account give it credit card it charges 1 dollar then gives it back. Hence it always free
https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/?source=:ow:o:h:po:OHPPanel1nav0625&intcmp=:ow:o:h:po:OHPPanel1nav0625
i did that, i made an instance just wanted to make sure its still in the free category
yea up to 4 ocpu and 24 gbs of ram is free
How do I disable random team by default off I set it up but I can‚Äôt close it off now
./teamselection
Is there a possibility of setting a random lobby password?
Like 5 character or something
yea you can do something like `/lobbydetails set "Host: HOST, Lobby Name: QUEUENUM, Lobby Password: PASSWORD8U"`
Where 8 in PASSWORD8U represents 8 characters long, and U represents all uppercase characters
so you would probably use PASSWORD5U
its letting me crank it all the way
oh nvm
LMAO, i was going to say
it worked at 32gb
for 30 days it will
but after it will charge
oh gotcha
Thanks
no problem, after 30 days you get limited but you still have like 300$ of credit
so i could put it higher and use the credit if i want
yes, also ampere is the always free option
it says Always Free
then thats perfect :0
for non ampere
for previous generation?
weird i didnt know that üôÇ
i guess both are
ill have to read the always free resources again
oh its a micro, then yea you get one micro and one ampere flex for free the flex goes up to 4 ocpu and 24 gbs of ram, the micro is like 1 gb of ram or something for free, also the more OCPU cores the more gbps connection you get it is tied to the cores
for always free you have one micro instance allowed but you can get another if you get rid of one of you ocpu core looks like this
the micros arent Ampere processors so normal x86 architecture
ahhh i see
Glad to show another this really cool deal as i have never seen any provider do that as of date. üôÇ
have you experimented into system startup, like systemd?
yea i made a service yesterday but didnt start it lol
I tried as well had issues with the pid and server control
i meant i didnt start it
so havent actually tried
will try on oracle tho
understood üôÇ
somehow i cant connect to an ubuntu machine, only the oracle linux machines
sounds like a conspiracy
wait what? did you do the auth key?
like ssh key
it makes no sense why it doesnt work
on ubuntu
hmmm, it works for me
what are you using to connect example putty, solarputty
yea putty
would you want help over a call, if not thats more than fine im just better at using screen share
yea 1 minute the bot is exploding again
all good take your time
Yeah üòÇ
<@145305657237700608> we cant report servers
in our discord
report scores
how long ago was the game
also what queue number
<@145305657237700608> 42463
Thanks
Team 1 won
theyre is some nasty bug going on where games are missing
ughhhhhh
try now
with /outcome
so its normal if the teamvote doesnt work right? to pick a winner?
i thought i was doing the commands wrong
no its not normal
when was your game
or is it every game
enable mmr is not wokring for my server they just cant click it for some reason
does it just not update?
like the button just doesnt work
it doesn‚Äôt update at all?
it looks like it resets back to 0-0 at the end but the vote should still work
The mmr wouldnt change at all, had to manually set it, the bot basically didnt change anyones mmr (question when they queue it would change their name when they queue again correct or no..)
was mmr disabled for that match?
i‚Äôm confused at what the problem was
someone spammed the bot and gaslighted the enemy into voting wrong, i solved it internally sorry ü§∑ i deal with children
is there anything i need to fix?
hate them children
yes, my broken heart
uhhh, i dont think so just dumb people honestly
i‚Äôm supposed to prevent people being able to be dumb
how dumb were they
1-10
we're talking like
is it just hitting the wrong button?
at least *billion*
~~no no they had the INTENTION~~
basically, a person convinced 5 people to vote incorrectly on purpose to be funny
and it backfired somehow
alright that is peak degen
can‚Äôt fix that then
hit ‚Äòem with a queue ban for a day
wise thinkin'
<@145305657237700608> can you add a timer to the ban unless there already is one?
there is
My bot isn‚Äôt setting the starting MMR to 0 I have tried to do it multiple times
do /info and check page 3 and post the result here
Nm I see the mistake
Can I put the MMR floor to 0?
Sure you can
When I do MMR floor it‚Äôs says 0 to disable it
oh.... true
that can be changed
ill change it
how it works
should be good now
i changed it so that you dont have to provide an mmr
so thats how you disable it
now you can just set it to 0
Cool thanks
havent touched it since I added it
is there a viable choice to allow a double pick?
which score?
correct yea
if its not possible it doesnt show
Something tells me the leaderboard never loaded haha
must‚Äôve forgotten something when i changed hosts
<@145305657237700608> check staff channel
Tried /mmrfloor
Got this message
provide an arg
it should say 1 optional
select it and choose mmr
yea the website fully cant communicate with the bot, mustve messed up my ssl certificate
uhhhhh no
whenever someone enters the system, their decay timer will start
do we think that should change?
What do you mean exactly?
yea i made the change for when i update next
unfortunately it will only affect new players
I think they should because that‚Äôs the point of MMR decay so people aren‚Äôt just sitting and not dropping from a rank or camping the top of leaderboard.
Yes but they can camp the bottom of the rank so they don‚Äôt demote
it makes sense what youre saying, people without any games arent even on the leaderboard
so they dont actually have any rank
that‚Äôs actually how the bot used to work
i changed it to be individual at some point
maybe we should have to a poll to see which is the best way to calculate mmr change
and i can support both ways, but set one as the default
the formula just replaced player mmr with team mmr
i think changing the variance value achieves the same thing
if you increase it, then you wont gain/lose as much
okaie thank you sorry for the late respond been super busy with work streaming and other things going along ‚ù§Ô∏è
Does the neatqueue bot ignore messages from other bots?
could you give me an example?
Is it possible to restrict MMR to mutiple lobbies within the one que ?
So, say I wanted to have multiple queues and have my own bot with a generic "Join queue" button - can I get my bot to add the player to a specific queue with the neatqueue slash command "/player add"?
Where my bot would determine which queue based on certain parameters such as roles etc
bots unfortunately cannot use slash commands
example?
thank you - is there a way around this? or could this possibly be included in API integration down the track?
also you can restrict queues to certain roles
hmmm i could add the ability to add users to queues into the API
talking about the NeatQueue API, not discord ofc lol
yeah awesome, thank you
ill add to next update, use the `/webhook generatetoken` token system to auth yourself
You are awesome, when does this one go live?
whenever I restart next, maybe tonight
Hey, if you have scope could you make it so you can remove players via the API aswell? üôè
sure!
the docs have a list of all the endpoints that are enabled right now
So awesome, thanks very much!
Hey <@145305657237700608> - I've tried comparing a user id to the id in the queue players endpoint and it seems to be dropping the last digit of the player id, when you have time can you please check this out?
<@145305657237700608> actually, it seems to work fine in postman, but when I fetch it in replit (js) it seems to drop it ü§î
uhhhhhh
that sounds very strange lol
it should always be 18 digits iirc
soooo I guess you were getting 19 digits? <#919709100114346076>
Can you add a feature so like for certain queues you have to have mmr on.
yea that makes sense to add
<#910981294937210930>
You‚Äôre the goat.
What is the command so mmr is always on?
./mmrchange
does anyone know how to use neat que bot for football fusion?
im trying to use it in my server for a que thing where like say in a 2v2 you click que to join can anyone help me?
not sure what football fusion is lol but using /setup should get you most the way there
okay thanks bro
appreciate it
i used setup command for queu
but when i named it
its not saying anything else after that
make sure you reply to the bots messages
i did
ill try again though
so do i have to say it in the channel it needs to be qued in?
correct the queue will start in the channel you type the command in
im having trouble with it but do you mind helping?
like im having trouble understanding
you can use /startqueue as well but i just made sure and /setup works
okay so do i type the setup or start queue in the channel the queue will be in?
okay thx
alr thanks
also neat
how do i do the part where
it shows like
wins
and stuff
leaderboard?
do you know how to activate or use it?
i tried adding all of them like mmr wins losses streak n stuff
I added the bot to my server and it wont let me use any commands like /help or / setup
To get start do /startqueue
/setup is abit dodgy sometimes you have to mention the bot for it to work
<@399720306316673025>
I got it <@914753310542688326> but do u know how to make it require ppl to regiater their gts before queing?
/requireign
/leaderboard
What does it mean when it says all inactive players will be kicked if they dont join the que channel
if you are not in the voice channel (if you make it required) the queue will kick for inactivity and clear queue) If im wrong on this feel free to correct me if you know otherwise. But thats my take and what i use it for on my server.
that‚Äôs correct yea
by default players are required to join the voice channels before teams can be made, you can change this with /voicechannels
also Neatz your uptime is really good now, glad to see it üôÇ
yessir no issues haha
epic and free, just how i like it üôÇ
can‚Äôt beat free lmao
tru that, well unless they give you money lmao
that‚Äôs the next step
Sorry I went to bed it was late for me
Yo does anyone know how to turn off when ppl have to join the vc for the bot to start the match
<@145305657237700608>
/voicechannels
<@145305657237700608> how do i turn off the voting of winners in the que chat
And how do i make it so ppl can not join que if they are already in a game
disable voting for a winner with /voteforresult
/multiqueue False
Ty bro
<@145305657237700608>
<@145305657237700608> how do sub 1 player for another
/substitute or /player sub
How do i take away wins or mmr i know its /add to give ppl bit i cant take away
<@145305657237700608> after every game when i try to do /outcome selectwinner it says the game was cancelled
you can just add a negative number
if you have voteforresult disabled, you can‚Äôt select a winner
it assumes the match doesn‚Äôt need a winner
O okay ty
<@145305657237700608> can u change wins or mmr to multiple ppl at the same time
no just one person
<@399720306316673025> 

https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/
Shows all the commands and what they do.
btw you are making like 6 requests at a time üò¢
Too much? üò¨
doesnt make sense to send 6 at once
oh its different channels
Is it going to cause issues if it is that constant? - I have a timed function to check the players in each channel within a category. It will also happen when I have a user click a button to join or leave as I'm using the API to put them into the correct queue
hmm it‚Äôs fine then
i‚Äôll add a bulk endpoint to get all the queues at once
Sounds good, I will update once you have published the changes!
also send me some screenshots of what you‚Äôve got going on, i‚Äôm interested
dm'd you üëç
For the channels that are made for the lobbiess - is it possible to have custom names assigned to the channel?
could you give me an example?
So - say I have a queue that has 2 teams but with four lobbies.
For lobby 1 I would have:
*Lobby 1 - (custom name: Cobra)*
*Lobby 1 - (custom name: Eagle)*
Lobby 2 would be:
*Lobby 2 - (custom name: Cobra)*
*Lobby 2 - (custom name: Eagle)*
what do these names correspond to?
Lobby 1 - (custom name: 1111Cobra)
Lobby 1 - (custom name: 1111Eagle)
Lobby 2 would be:
Lobby 2 - (custom name: 1112Cobra)
Lobby 2 - (custom name: 1112Eagle)
like that?
is this the channel names?
Yeah i think hes referring to the channel names being auto generated.
You can change the team channel names with /teamnames
it will still have the queue number though
Hey NeatZ im having trouble setting the /autorole set ? i've entered the lowest value and highest but the bot is just thinking?
i see that it broke for you
seems to be with a new server without any players
should work anyways
Thanks, mentioning that there were no players, I added a user to the channel who was not an admin or bot and it seemed to work <:Dong:583567163240218626>
yea should be fixed in next update, the issue was recalculating the roles for all users when there arent any lol
btw the new endpoint will be `@app.get("/api/queues/{server_id}/players")`
which returns a json of channel ids -> queue players
Yeah my bad haha probably should have checked if there were any players first. Any idea why the /teamnames isn't updating the team names after changing them? ive tried ending the ques even but it doesnt want to change the names üò¶
<@666182543745351690> What‚Äôs your servers name?
Hey NeatZ, wasn't sure if this was live or not yet - I am getting "detail": "Not Found" for this endpoint
oh i never updated
should be good now
Awesome! thanks üôÇ
anyone can use those commands
those aren‚Äôt staff only
actually people can't on my server, when they type /leaderboard it doesnt show anything and the command itselft doesn't work
Only admins have rights or smth
check your servers integrations and see if someone modified the permissions to use the commands
I have a question
how do i get the pick your role thing off
how do i get the pick your role thing off the queue
because i want it to be a plain channel thats like a texxt channel but it has the option to vote for a winner
i want to make it a 1v1 queue
any help?
Ok 1 thing at a time. You just want to make it a regular queue?
Not a role queue?
Is it possible to make it so you can leave a team if you happen to join the wrong one?
not currently
yeah
Hi. How to start playing 10 Mans 5 vs 5?
`/startqueue queuename:10 Mans teamsize:5`
He joined from forge dw haha
oh lmao
First one I‚Äôve seen join the bot discord to ask rather then our support üòÇüòÇ
impressive really lol
Yes friends, it's funny to me too. I'm not very good at discord. But it made you laugh.
Hey guys,
I am having an issue where people are able to join the queue more than once, then when they try to leave queue it will remove one instance of the player.
Anyone know the cause or fix for this? üôÇ
Also when the queues are created, only 1 person is able to vote üòÆ
You must have /Test on
Do ./test disable
<@269238227653623809>
Only 1 person is allowed to vote for winner?
hello im dingus friend in support chat
Do you want me to join or something?
yes please ‚ù§Ô∏è
It would be a lot easier haha
I can‚Äôt talk but I‚Äôll watch
all good if you can type and explain that will be super helpful üôÇ
Hmmm not something I‚Äôve seen before
Inv to server
Shouldn‚Äôt be something wrong with the roles
Need admin perms
This is very weird
<@623824199768866817> this ur server?
Thats saying what the problem is
Maybe try deleted and remake q
If it‚Äôs something to do with the bot I can‚Äôt fix that as I can‚Äôt access NeatZ side of bot
I can jump on shortly but I made an additional queue before and the same issue was occurring, so not sure deleting queue will help
I wouldn‚Äôt say smart but I know the bot haha. And /test isn‚Äôt working so it must be something on his end.
Nope cause /test is disabled but I can still join Q multiple times.
What was your questions I wasn‚Äôt listening
Im pretty sure the /test is on a loop or something causing people able to join the que more than once.
<@145305657237700608> you asleep? Or not
I don‚Äôt help out as much anymore i got school back on so rarely here
So if neat is asleep can‚Äôt be fixed for another 10ish hours.
Unless his sleep schedule is bummed
I didn‚Äôt help much haha, just not much I can do without seeing his end üò©
Anyways night brothers, good luck‚ù§Ô∏è neat will get back to yous soonish
Definitely nothing to do with roles
in awake now if anyones got questions still
<@623824199768866817> <@269238227653623809>
hey mate, yer we still having issue and not sure how to solve it. üò¶
i‚Äôve got a meeting rn but feel free to shoot me an invite if it‚Äôll help
no worries ill add you and send u a discord invite
thank you <@145305657237700608>, do you think you'll have time to voice chat soon?
yea i‚Äôm free to talk anytime from 9:15est to 11est
Aight sweet, we'll join voice chat in a few minutes in this server and you join whenever you're ready ‚ù§Ô∏è
Can someone easily explain to me@how Variance mmr works? I do not understand that graph it says to look at or how the system works
sure, imagine you have a 1000mmr player beating a 2000mmr player, and an mmrchange of 50. With a high variance value like 5000, both players will gain/lose almost exactly 50 mmr. With a low variance value of say 400, player1 would win closer to 75 mmr, and player2 would lose about 75 mmr
kind of confusing, but a high variance number corresponds to decreased variance
also the graph just allows you to change the values easily to see the effect
So it would be set up so if a low level beats a high level they would gain more mmr and the higher level would lose more mmr? Correct
yea that is the effect, it just changes how far it strays away from the average value
Interesting, I like that. I‚Äôll have to mess with it and see if I can get it set up well
```py
player_mmr_x_team_mmr_avg = (team_avg_mmr_without_player + player_mmr) / 2

base_mmr_gains = number_of_other_teams * (1 / (1 + 10 ** ((player_mmr_x_team_mmr_avg - losing_team_avg_mmrs) / mmr_variation)) * 2 * mmr_change)

placement_multiplied_gains = base_mmr_gains * ((0.4 * (1.2**-played_games) + 1) if played_games < 11 else 1)

streak_multiplied_games = placement_multiplied_gains * (0.075 * (abs(streak) - 1) + 1)
```
ill just post this here, its the full equation in 4 steps
(in python)
So the lower the variance value the more mmr won/lost Vs a big level difference? Or would it be the higher the value the more won/lost
the first one `So the lower the variance value the more mmr won/lost Vs a big level difference?`
Perfect and it would be less obviously with a lower level difference. Got it now. Thank you!
exactly! np
How do you make a normal queue
not a role queue
you can disable roles via `/roles`
roles are disable by default if you use `/startqueue`
`/setup` lets you choose
Is it possible to copy all settings from one queue to another? and would that work to a different discord?
yea, /save and /load
how to get rid of this
get rid of what
the role selection thing
team selection
you dont want teams?
huh?
i dont want it to come up with the team selection
what do you want then
i want it to just take you into a channel
that is for only you and the other person
oh its a 1v1
yeah
do /teamselection balanced
thanks
Is it possible to set up a seperate channel to use /stats and /leaderboard?
yes you can use /link to link a non queue channel to a queue channel
so i have rank roles 1-50 and for some reason when you reach the MMR for the 50 role it doesn't give the role. But every other role below 50 works when MMR is set. Any ideas why this is happening?
maybe /mmr ceiling is lower than 9000?
I have /mmr ceiling set to 10000
is that role below NeatQueue's?
No I have neatqueue at the bottom below all of the roles
put NeatQueue above all the roles you want the bot to manage
Wow, thank you so much lol i was trying for so long to figure it out
It was weird that ALL of the other roles worked when set but not the last one
that is very strange lol
but for the most part, you can‚Äôt manage roles that are above your top role
Can you make it so a message pops up saying a player joins or leaves the queue?
message where?
it shows that in the queue message
or do you mean do you can see there was a new message in the channel
Yes, this
So people can get a notification if someone joins or leaves
i can add a config so the queue message doesn‚Äôt get updated
and instead it sends a new one
That would be cool
.suggest Ability to disable queue message edits so it shows a notification for queue activity
Your suggestion has been submitted to the server staff for review!
like this
we don‚Äôt really need all the messages
we can just send a new message and delete the old one
instead of editing
i guess both could be options
very easy to change anyways
oh true, not yet
definitely can add that, lots of data now
i was thinking off adding best teammates/worst enemies to the stats
like /stats
overall want to refactor /stats and give it a nice overhaul
idk where to fit all the data, gonna probs start from scratch
all stats are stored via the queue name so it won‚Äôt be all time
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/954499196629692486/1005909442543497236 not sure if you mean exactly what I mean do you mean like the name for the channel will change to Queue locked currently for example?
Do you know how to add more people to have access to a queue ticket after somebody has made one
I want to add my mods so they can supervise
queue ticket?
yeah
idk what that is
for /timer votes 

once that time is up can you make it so it just cancels the match queue like it does with /lobbychannel timer  instead of force starting with random teams?
For example if somebody isn't there
ehhh, when the timer elapses it just picks the option with the most votes
if you want to make sure everyone is present before starting a match, that is what /lobbychannel is used for
Ya, but lets say everyone is there and then suddenly someone has to leave, what can i do to cancel that voting timer que and bring everyone back to the queue and wait for 1 more person.
OR is there an option to vote to cancel the match instead of choosing a team? or would you just use the "tie"
players can use /cancel
admins can also force a cancel with /outcome cancel, or click the cancel/revert button
yep just saw, okay perfect
For implementing global queues, you would assume your stats would carry over right?
like if you were in two servers with queues that are linked, your stats should be the same in both
yea that can be added as a config, they auto delete anyways when they are started automatically and the vote fails
.suggest Support for several additional languages by volunteers.
Your suggestion has been submitted to the server staff for review!
So as in like get more staff that can communicate with other languages if needed?
i think they mean support other languages inside the bot itself
there is a translation project in the planned features, it will be a huge undertaking though and currently can‚Äôt see the payoff for the amount of work it‚Äôll be
Ye, I think generally most of the world speaks English, obviously not everyone does or country
english is obviously the main priority since mostly every server using NeatQueue is an english server
Yeah
You can merge 2 seperate queues together right? So that the ranks stay the same no matter which que you join and play in?
yup, all stats are tied to the queue name
so if they both have the same /queuename, the stats are shared
Sweet
So i know how to copy the auto role settings to another que channel, but can you copy all of the settings that i have on a que?
yes, you can use /save
and /load
Does this work transferring to a different server?
But you can't transfer the autoroles to another server right? or can you
no it wont work
i should actually fix that
should be fixed in next update
Hey just seen the explanation for hybrid draft, and seems very confusing. We have the same issue as the guy who suggested hybrid for a 4v4 game but I think that another draft solution is much easier. If there was an option that it went 1-2-1-1 etc. then it would solve our problem
Quick question:
Is there a way this system can be integrated for elo calculation? https://trueskill.org/
Is this already in use by any chance?
hmm could be interesting to try
the elo calculation is kinda custom made by me
People hate true skill in halo infinite, it's why we use neat queue.
Why is that, if I may ask? üòÑ
i wanna try it out myself and see how the two compare
can‚Äôt imagine we will change though
It rewards individual performance more than winning or losing.
Especially when many of the games played are objective where k/d is less important
I see
also you can customize NeatQueues elo equation a good bit
see <#910981294937210930> , ill re-generate the docs now so it includes those commands
there https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=predictions-1
like for it to show in the temp channel?
no since people in the game cannot predict
only people that are not in the game can predict
yea I actually added this
for when I update next
yup all the prediction stuff updates every time someone predicts
to reflect the estimated gains and such
wait its messed up
oops
its the countdown
it re-updates and shows an old version
oops
that happens if there are no other predictions on other teams
k just updated
since predictions are bets against each other
like any normal betting
the points have to come from somewhere
anyways it should be fixed hopefully
I‚Äôve been messing with MMR variance a bit but I don‚Äôt think it actually is working correctly, or I‚Äôm not doing it right. I‚Äôm trying to make it so if you lose, you‚Äôre only losing about half of the MMR as you would gain. 

If winning gives +50
Losing would give -25
did you specify the loser_mmr_change?
otherwise the win/lose values are the same, just inverted
Ya it‚Äôs set to 25 and mmr is 50, but if a 5000 mmr player loses to a 2000 mmr player they should be losing more on the end of 75 and not 25 if that makes sense.
if any mmrchange is set to 25, the total range of change is 0 - > 50
thats just how the equation works
the variance is what changes how far the change strays from 25
if the variance value is like 1, then the range is 0 -> 50
if the variance value is like 5000, then the range is more like 23 -> 27
Ok, and is there a limit to variance value?
Like could I put it at 20000 if I wanted
technically there is no check
but as you increase it, less starts happenings
if 5000 is a range of 23 -> 27, 20000 is probably just a range of 24.7 -> 25.3
Which makes no sense, shouldn‚Äôt it be even more?
the mmrvariance value is inversely correlated to the actual variance
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ue5labtkpv
its legit just changing the variable in this equation
perhaps i should change the command to reflect this inverse so if you input 20000, it treats it as 1 instead
Maybe im just not understanding
Hold on I‚Äôm gonna give an example maybe it‚Äôll be easier for me to understand if you can answer it
So im trying to make it like this, The higher MMR players who win gain less  than the lower MMR players that win.

On the losing team, the higher MMR player loses more than the lower MMR player. Im trying to set it up like this but cant get the right number figures set up to do so.
Right now with my 

Variance value - 5000
MMR change - 50 this is what is happening.

Highest MMR player is gaining the most  and lowest MMR player is losing the Most.
so with a variance value of 5000, basically everyone will gain right around 50 MMR
however, there are also placement match and win/loss streak multipliers
looks like you want `/mmrchange mmr:100 loser_mmr:50 variance:10000`
a 5000 MMR player beating a 4000 avg team would yield 89 MMR
similar to your screenshot
Thats with a 10,300 variance value?
I just did a test with /mmrchange mmr:50 Loser_mmr:25 Variance:5000

and got this result. Why is every value different is my main question, when they have the same MMR
it gets confusing when all the players are the same
since it changes the streak/placement match number
for each player
Can you do variance AND Static combined or it wont work like that
no that doesnt work, static means the mmrchange is always the same exact value
so it doesnt even use the equation
Okay I think I have it figured right then, you just aren‚Äôt going to see much change when everyone is around the same MMR
with a high variance value, yes
however the streak and placement multipliers will still show more change
Exactly
is there a way to disable that? maybe in the future ?
or i can use /set streak i guess
yea i should add more config for the multipliers
Jus wanted tk ask if after the queue channel closes does it go tk deleted messages or does disappear for good @
<@145305657237700608>
You know how discord servers have like a channel for deleted messages?
i dont
like using another bot?
sure
what about it?
Does it go to that deleted messages channel
Or does all the messages delete for good
i have no clue how those bots handle it
im assuming its gone for good
Alright
neatz
i see the bug
Is there a way to have 4 roles and have 1 player on each team, to make 1 versus 1?
<@145305657237700608> Is the status button working?
yea but i found a bug with /autoroles topplayers when calculating the rank up
fixing
not sure what u mean here tho
fixed
Having 1 versus 1, for example I choose 4 roles, and my enemy chooses to play with one of the four roles too,
1x1
if its a 1v1, why do you need roles?
it wouldnt change anything
For me to choose a role to play, now if I put 4 roles and I put /teamsize 1, the bot puts only one role, in One vs One, it's nice to have the option to choose which role I want to take, to face my enemy
i get that, but that wouldnt change anything
doesnt matter what role you would choose, roles are only used in creating teams
in the past you could choose a role, there was a sniper/support/assassin/, I chose a sniper and my sniper friend too, now if I choose a role for the heroes, only 1 role appears and no other option, that is, I have to create 3 different channels , for a One vs One with each role different?
what im saying is, if its a 1v1
it doesnt matter what role you are
its still a 1v1
if its Sniper vs Sniper, Sniper vs Support, whatever
the bot doesnt do anything with that information in a 1v1
So I should let you know in the lobby text channel, which role am I going to play?
sure cuz it doesnt matter to the Bot
I'm sad, it was something I really liked
<:PepeCry2:918155150936375297>
im not sure what u mean really, i havent changed anything like that
I tried with the command /forcestart, to start when each team has a player, but it still didn't work :( , I don't understand what happened
I have 1 versus 1 on my old server it works but now if I set up a new one it doesn't work
well
set your roles
and use /queue size override
i have no clue what will happen but maybe it‚Äôs what u did
It worked, thank you angel Neatz
<a:cat_kiss:926271726772453438>
that‚Äôs crazy that it still works then lol
very much unintended but aight
If you use the /lock command to close the queue with the timer, timezone, repeat etc..
Is there any way to delete this?
if you scheduled a lock uhhhhh
<:POGGIES:872507536245391400>
oh wait
set auto_lock to false
I got it I think
the queue channel name on empty/not empty seems to be partially broken for around a week after working fine, like when someone joins the queue it will update but when the queue is empty it doesn't change back
it can only update twice per a 10 minute period, is that the issue?
it isnt
i tested it with a separate queue and its been 15 minutes as well
i see that
ill fix it soon
thanks \:) youre the üêê
should be fixed, you probably need to set the channel names again tho
appreciate it
Are the leaderboards bugged currently?
looks fine, what do u see
that just means no data
only players who have played a match appear
does data get wiped if the queue name changes?
we should have weeks worth of games and it was displaying fine yesterday until i changed the queue name
ah yea, all stats are tied to the queue name
if you use /rename, it will migrate all the old stats to the new name
/queuename just changes the name
you can see the stored stats via /serverstats
so what you should do is use /queuename to change it back to the old name, then /rename for a new name
Thanks you so much!
After our que had teams made and we were playing, after about an hour it ended the queue randomly before anyone got to vote. Which timer is that for that not to happen. 

Also when i report the match from the /Staff channel it doesnt take affect?
it‚Äôs /timer matchcleanup seconds:
which auto wraps up the match
and what happens when you try and change the outcome, nothing?
Well when i chose the winner it shows the mmr changing on the log but not updating roles and leaderboards and stuff
i‚Äôll double check if roles are updated (they should) but the leaderboard should update for sure
It doesn't update MMR
so it happened twice and the first match i reported it shows the mmr changing, but then the next match i reported some of the players lost MMR from what it was previously
for example look at riddle and tryumphs MMR after the first match reported
Then the next match we lose and our MMR didn't change
hmm alright, did you manually choose the results for both?
alright i‚Äôll check it out
Cool
Ill just update MMRs manually for now
my guess is that the second match started before the first one was closed?
Shouldn't have a problem now though i changed the match cleanup timer
They both ended due to the match cleanup
So i had to select both
ah okay, probably something related to that
likely using old mmr values or something
who knows
should be easy to debug tho, thanks for the good info üôÇ
Is there a way to make the Queue chats bigger or unlocked so we can join to talk to eachother
I can drag the other chat into my queue chat but then their queue chat will dissapear if i drag all of them
the voice channels?
Ya the ones it auto creates
you can disable channel restrictions
or you can add a spectator role/staff role and the channel size will increase by the number of people with the role
Perfect thanks, one last thing. I have team names set but can you make it where the Queue chat channels display as the team name?
the voice channels should reflect the team name
They do not, they just display as Queue#and then a number
Another thing to add to this for you, it doesn't go show up in the /resultschannel when Admin selects a winner
oh for the first channel, yea that‚Äôs the same always
it‚Äôs not the team channel, just the lobby channel
it does if it wasn‚Äôt cleaned up
oh okay gotcha
yea it treats it as a Tie if nobody voted, and by default ties are disable i think
so it doesn‚Äôt show
this is fixed, good catch though!
multiqueue setting is broken
please fix
fixed
fast!!!
thx!
np, oopsie
I would like to be able to change a player's MMR, for example, on a linked channel.
How to reduce MMRs and winnings for players who commit room violations.
what is a room violation
you can
When i do /Map Selection: Random it still makes you vote for each map type
oh the gamemode?
Like after i click best of/whatever can it randomly generate a list instead of voting
hey guys... Few questions

Is there a way to set up 1, 2, 3, or even 4 custom queues to do specific things which I can name them something specific...

For example 

/startqueue1 /startqueue2 etc...
with commands like /in or /out

And I know when players join they can give themselves a rank, but is there a way for that rank to be saved and documented somewhere?
you can create unlimited queues, its just 1 per channel
once you start a queue, it will run forever
there is no /in or /out, its just clicking the queue buttons
not sure what you mean about the rank though
against the rules
is this something that needs to be added possibly? or is the `/map selction: Random`  bugged?
i‚Äôll need to add the random selection to the gamemode, it only does the map currently
<@145305657237700608> So in my discord server we have tiers assigned to players that reflect their skill level. S, A, B, C, D, etc.... is there a way to give them an equal value for when teams are being picked to show the odds of winning?
so you want to give people those roles? or you want the teams to be balanced via those roles
I gave them an evuivilant MMR rating, I want 8 people 2 queue up for a 4v4, then once the captains are settled and the teams are picked I want it to show the overall score and show the odds of each team winning I thought I saw that
it doesn‚Äôt show the odds, only the estimated mmr changes
also hopefully you used /startingmmr to assign the different mmrs
<@145305657237700608> I did, I recorded a 3min video to maybe clarify my questions, im sorry im new to the bot and spent a while trying to get it set up
https://www.loom.com/share/1452b87e68c543808de0edb42fca1e12
i‚Äôm out right now so i‚Äôll get back to you in a bit üòÑ
Can you answer this in the meantime?

What does the:
0 points mean
50% mean
1:0 mean?
it‚Äôs a prediction so 50% of the points bet are for team 1, same for team 2
if you make a bet for team 1, it would go up to 100%
you can disable predictions also with /predictions
the 1:0 is the payout
so for every point you bet, you will receive 0 points since the other team is at 0 points still
is there a way to make this part ALWAYS default captains?
yup with /teamselection
and is there a way to make this part 2nd best or 2nd worse only?
./captainselection but it‚Äôs only 1 option
and can I save that to a default load for the type of queue I want to get started?
you can save a config with /save
and load with /load
and if I keep making changes with /save? it just keep adding on to updates I am making? Also for the captains... does it randomly select one out of the two? or is there an order <@145305657237700608>
also TY for the help, this bot is SICK
for any captain selection mode, the lowest mmr player picks first if that‚Äôs what you mean?
also imagine /save is creating a snapshot of your current queue config, so any time you make a change you would need to re-save it
got it just making sure. and the picks are always 1-1-1-1?
that depends on the /captains drafttype
by default it is 1-2-2-2
okay cool, and depending on the pool can we change the draft type once the pool hits 8/8 ?
last question after a team is picked and the game starts it looks like it loads up another queue, can we stop that from happening, so somebody would need to do /load #### again?
no not really, draft type is always the same, there is no vote for that
also no, the main point of NeatQueue is that queues are always running and don‚Äôt need any admin intervention
you could always /lock it if you don‚Äôt want people to play
okay cool, i have one more then... if I have a dedicated channel for the queue, once the queue is locked can it post the teams for captains to pick in a different channel?>
with /tempchannels it will create a new text channel once the queue is filled for the team setup if that‚Äôs what you mean
this is amazing insight
TY man
also is there a way to assign specific MMRs to each role respectively? <@145305657237700608>
yup with /startingmmr
you can even restrict queues to certain roles/mmrs
Okay, I tried to assign all of the roles to a specific mmr, but it seemed like every role was just the highest one
and the higher one got to capytain first, maybe its because of the draft type, idk
if you have multiple roles, it will be the highest starting mmr
also if you already have entered the queue, you wont get a new starting mmr
then how do multiple people from different roles join, giving the lowers mmr the first pick?
not sure what you mean
when someone first joins, theyre mmr starts at the highest /startingmmr for the roles they have
Do you or anybody else offer voice support?
i do but not right now
overall when someone first joins the queue, they are given a starting mmr. This starting mmr comes from the highest mmr for any of the roles they have that have a starting mmr assigned
No worries, ideally when is a good day or time for you?
perhaps tomorrow but likely monday
I can¬¥t disable this command "Unlock queue time"
you mean disable the autolock?
`/lock auto_lock:False`
I can't start the match in 1 versus 1, it asks for a majority vote, but it's not going
I tried by minority and it didn't work
How do you reset a leaderboard?
/resetstats all  queue_name:krokinik
be careful not to write only resetstatsall
hmm i‚Äôll have to check it out myself
should be fine but something may be up
And the player has -100 win rate is also having a problem

- 2 games too
did you manually set stats?
consegui do mmr
you must have
nop, I played with him, he was with me
never seen that, the bot never subtracts from the game count
There were two matches that were cancelled, because the best of three wasn't working, so I canceled, did that match count?
if you have vote for results enabled then no it wouldn‚Äôt count
stats are only updated when the winner is selected
there is only 1 previous game listed as well which makes no sense
<a:926907724573331456:926990459644022875>
the leaderboard does not show mmr in the updated name, the guy has 1012 mmr in the 1 versus 1 queue, but in the leaderboard he appears with 1000. In the /stats command he also appears with 1000 in the name, it takes time to update nick with mmr?
you are asking why the leaderboard doesn‚Äôt show mmr in the name?
that is probably an outdated format
or something
ratinginname shouldn‚Äôt appear in the leaderboard
Okay, hopefully I can make one of those work around your schedule.

Is there a way to assign multiple roles different MMRs so that way when teams are picked we can get a sense for the skill level of each player?
./startingmmr let‚Äôs you assign a starting mmr per role
i cant replicate this issue
whats your config?
also let me know if you know the steps you took to get the negative games
i checked this out, I think you had this cleared up mostly?
im just working out some kinks
a call would be nice only if you are available
nah its too late for me to hop on a call, tomorrow tho
<#910981294937210930>
Awesome man, I appreciate all your help and time to add things
im free all day actually
Can we meet in 20 mins
Can someone remind me how to add an MMR range to a role? It's been so long since I had to9 do it
can't find the command
im good in like 5
./autoroles
legend
cool just lmk
<@145305657237700608> I did a test and it auto gave people the highest MMR
how can I make it so they just join in with the MMR/tier they have
that is what should happen
make sure they arent in the system already
but if a B tier = 300 MMR joins, I dont ewant him to just automatically get S+ tier...

any ideas on how to fix tat?
they wont unless they have the S+ role
I tested it and everyone automatically got S+
we had 4 people join it
whats the config code?
or invite me
also make sure the /info looks fine
let me run a nother test really quick
<@145305657237700608> you available one more time?
sure
ill join the vc again
<@145305657237700608> if there are 2 queues and i go ot queue channel to cancel or mak a change... will it give me the option to choose which game I want to edit? I wanna make sure b4 I go change something
the admin version /outcome cancel and /player sub let you say the game number
it will let me choose whcih one though?
<@145305657237700608> also I see a lot of people getting default B roles by joining the queue, but only some of them, super weirrd
did they have a role before
yes they did
1) the auto role change thing, what could it be?
2) can I sub players from different teams? so swapping basically?
3) if I want to cancel one of 3 queues how do I select which one?

<@145305657237700608>
what auto roles change
2) not really
so it looked like some people got the B role
3) specify the queue number
will there be a submission for that? or will it ask me after I use the command
in the command /outcome
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to set a specific time out for inactivity on a queue?
Like after 60minutes of inactivity they will get kicked from queue?
yeah I found it, I set it for 10 minutes
All good
Have a good rest of your night/day
-if you require anymore assistance just @ me‚ù§Ô∏è
You can do 
/ player Sub: player1: player2:
doesnt work after teams are picked tho
Are you entering the Que number
It works for me
/player sub: player1: player2: gamenum:
You have to wait for the winner message to come up then you can /sub. 
- if your not an admin and are trying to sub you can only do /substitute for yourself.
You don‚Äôt need to do the queen number if your doing it in the temp channel. 
Queue number is optional unless you don‚Äôt have temp channels on.
the queue num is optional anyways, its only needed if there are multiple matches in the same channel, or if you are typing the command outside of the match channel
so yea basically if you have temp channels disabled
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to set MMR for somebody unranked to give them a starting rank based off of the first game they won?
could u give an example
soembody with an "unranked" role joins and gets S tier... I just need to assign  starting mmr to it, but I dont know that everything should just get a basic starting mmr because they are "unranked" so wondering if they can get a starting mmr depending on who they beat or lose to
also is there a way to adjust the timer for captains to select, right now its 60 seconds, then it auto picks i want it at 3 minutes
no, the starting mmr comes straight from their role
/timer vote
<@145305657237700608> where can I double check all of the commands for voting at the end? I had a match played 5 people voted, but the game didnt get logged
I had to do it manually
like the winner wasnt selected?
yeah, i had to manually do it
5 voted, channel dleeted and the match didnt get logged
no errors on my end, you sure you didnt change the results channel
I think its just timing out
Which command makes the vote last longer before timing out? or is there a way for people needing to vote before it goes away
/timer matchcleanup
okay, also it looks like stats arent being updated. Any way to chekc on this?
PBEJY
what stats arent updating
wins/loses etc..
had like 6 matches be played today and everybodys stats are staying the same
just ran a test match and it worked fine
are you selecting winners?
they are voting themselves and I had to go manually vote for one since it timed out
but I have somebody who won 2 games and lost 1 today and his stats are the same as yesterday
oh i see a typo with manually selecting the winner
normal voting should be fine though
looks like its fixed
So we actually had 3 matche scompleted today, and 1 currently in progress.

I had to manually record 2 of them
but no stats updated
why do you need to manually modify them?
should be a rare thing
because the match took over 90 minutes and it timed out
i updated it to bw 2 hours, which should be plenty, this was a rare case anyways
also with your config, you dont have a startingmmr for everyone
so anyone that queues without a role will get the default 1000 mmr
and place in S
yeah i fixed that in directly
only ppl w roles can queue
Lmk what you find with the stats <@145305657237700608> 
If there was a bug with me manually voting is it fixed?
Was there any bug with their votes you could find?
it was a manual voting bug
Got it, any way to get the stats to count for it?
Or do we just move on
I wonder if I could just change the winner then change it back?
might work, not sure
probably would if you mark tie and then change it back
Okay but all in all stats should work accords the board? <@145305657237700608>
<@145305657237700608> is there any way to have this auto refresh in the temp channel just like the queue?
Sorry to bug: but also switching players isnt working
you must wait for the winner message to pop up
not currently
Any desire to make this happen?
maybe, not for now since its pretty annoying to do lol
Lol I‚Äôll send you $10 for it üòÇ
<@145305657237700608>
maybe, ill have to see
if its 4 teams and 2 win, will there be a second vote for the top 2 teams to play in the finals? <@145305657237700608>
are you talking about /numberofteams 4?
yeah its all good i see i just need to wait till its all done to votew
I think it's better to change this message, I was confused because the command is "party create"
oh that‚Äôs outdated, good catch
it used to be /team but it changed
How did you do it?
./votingmenu add per_team:True
I tried to ban hero, but it didn't work :(

Title: Vote to Ban an Agent

 Options: SMITH, FOX, FURY, KIM, NUKE, FROST, ROBBIE, PLAGUE, HOPPER

key:Team

button_colors:green

show_numbers:True

number_of_votes:1 

per_team:True
what happens?
delete the votingmenu and show how you sent the command
hmm okay and it just shows the one option?
that‚Äôs weird, it just worked for me
i‚Äôll have to check it out when i‚Äôm back
I don't know why it worked, but I turned off per team and color and order
oh you know what
you probably only specified 1 color
so it only could do one option
i‚Äôll fix it to use default colors in that case
<a:cat_kiss:926271726772453438>
have maDE NO changes on our end
its not letting me do anything bot related like commands etc
it just responded must of been glitched
looks like the database lost connection at that time
<@145305657237700608> If I have the bot on my server before reaching 1000 servers, can I use without limitation?
yea every server before 1000 will get the highest level premium forever
<:POGGIES:872507536245391400>

I'm really very happy with your || I'll try to help your bot by donating a little and finding bugs||
<a:zt_catcuddle:940466823684558878>
thx, im always fixing bugs in the background
ive been refactoring the bot so that I can reload the entire bot without needing to restart, which lets me publish changes live
its about 60% done id say
<:POGGIES:872507536245391400>
hey guys the leaderboard for the bot stopped loading on our server , any ideas?
what are you seeing?
oh the website
one sec
looks like they are all broken lol i‚Äôll see what‚Äôs wrong
oh ok haha
website is fully goofed
looks fixed
<@182188193024573440> looking good?
thankyou it works now üôÇ
cool! I also made the data auto refresh every 10 seconds cuz that sounds cool
How do I get the queue out of test mode? I tried /test again but it‚Äôs still on test mode
Never mind I guess it is disabled but it still says TEST MODE next to the queue title.
it only updates when someone joins/leaves the queue
so yea should be fine
ok thanks also does the queue disappear when someone has joined, i just set it up and now its gone LOL sorry for the silly questions
no it shouldn‚Äôt
looks like the bot is missing perms in your channel
i just gave it access to everything is there a way to load a previous queue
like when i type in /info its still all there
just /clearqueue and the message will appear
excellent thank you
<@145305657237700608> you around for a question?
<@210568751270199306> <@202076845615611904> Can I not do queues with customizations for 8 teams (32 players total?)
you should be able to i think
actually i see an issue
i‚Äôll have to fix
its capped at 5 teams right now
need some help

can anyone help me#
please
please dm me if you can
I need help setting up a leaderbaord and working system in my server
did you start a queue?
<@145305657237700608> I have a few questions for you if you have time.... not really tech, but more ideas i have for a bigger community
you can always send me messages but if you wanna call maybe tomorrow
there is a way to force start a queue i know... but is there a way to vote to delete one if a temp channel is created, and maybe somebody has to leave without needing a moderator?
players can use /cancel which starts a vote to cancel the match üôÇ
gotcha... is there a way for the teams to be posted in a seperate channel once a pool fills up? So people can see whos playing vs who and make their predicitons?
well when the prediction happens, there is a button to view teams
but the teams message is for the players
anyways something can be added so the teams also are put in a public channel for people to see whats going on?
is that just for prediction purposes?
yes, and people like to side bet in my server
well you can view teams on the prediction
When people vote it often says "interaction failed"

Mind looking into it?
Is there a way to edit this timer? for predictions? <@145305657237700608>
Hey can Anyone help with setting up a leaderboard and working queue
Dm me if you can help thanks very much
<@145305657237700608>
can you help me with the bot
can u join mys erver and set it up please
did you start a queue
can u join the server
and help please
alright
I dmd u it
still?
I can check it later and let you know... but for now i did notice that when i have 5 different queues on a new server, it resets my MMR and sends me a notification anytime i join a new queue for the first time

am I missing a step here on why its doing that?
are they named differently?
or the same
named differently
<@145305657237700608>
so all stats are stored via the queue name
so it makes sense that different queues have different stats
got it... so I should just keep them all the same name?
if you want the stats to be shared across them, yea
this is intentional since it allows you to create separate leaderboards for different queues
or share them
<@145305657237700608> how can I keep them all the same? is there a way without changing that names? or is that it
currently that‚Äôs it
whats the new commands for prediction timers and pings?
<#954499196629692486>
it says in there
but it‚Äôs just subcommands of /predictions
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to transfer stats to a new server?
no but i can do it
Not necessary ^
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to restrict a role from joining the queue? 

Right now you can make it so you need specific roles to join, yes

But, is there a way to have a "muted" role restricted even though they have the other role(s) that would allow it?
yup i added it yesterday
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/954499196629692486/1016003455476834344
`/bannedroles`
The queues still have the "lock" command active, even though I disable the time and use the "unlock" command
what happens when you unlock?
also what is the channel id
It temporarily unlocks for one day, then the next day it has a closed queue
982989898267111445

978937829574991922
looks like auto lock is enabled still
u cant disable it?
I disabled it but it keeps closing the queues, I tried unlock it didn't work either
can u do the command and show the input/output
actually
i think i see why
<:emoji_160:932612460786106418>
Try Unlock or Lock?
the command
it says its still enabled
Tomorrow will close the queues again
yea i see that
try now
and ill verify
yes it is open again thanks Neatz
epic
<@145305657237700608> still does this pretty often
somehow you aren‚Äôt added in that vote hmmm
yea can confirm the captains were excluded from the vote
adding them back now
how do we update this timer?
uhhh currently you can‚Äôt
with the current system it can‚Äôt be updated easily since the cooldown is applied to all queues
and all queues behave the same
ill take a look at updating it though
"/outcome selectwinner" command has unexpected error occur. Any recommendations? Is there a setting where a single vote from an admin can determine the winner of a match for the winner vote?
i noticed you had an error, i‚Äôll have to fix it but it‚Äôs because you reset MMR
So at least one person in that match has no mmr, so it can‚Äôt calculate mmr changes
again i will have to implement a fix, but you can try again once everyone has an mmr again from either queuing or using /set mmr
Thank you! And is there a setting where a single vote from an admin can decide the winner of a match?
what do you mean, like so that only the admin can decide a winner?
otherwise admins can select a winner via /outcome or by clicking buttons in the /staffchannel
Ah, that makes sense. Thank you again!
Yo <@145305657237700608>  the discord server you helped me with the queues arent working
what do u mean
queues wont create another channel
you have tempchannels enabled still?
Im pretty sure ye
Can you help me fix it?
so what‚Äôs actually happening
are matches being created at all?
nope
I gtg for my dinenr ill be back in a min il dm u server link if u wanna try fix
plz try and explain what is happening
Ok so when two people join a queue it doesnt create a channel for them to discuss it and start the match choose who creates the match and say who wins
so what happens instead
Blocked the queue again :(
server id again?
nvm, all your channels seem to have auto lock enabled
did you not enable it? otherwise ill have to test
i should probably refactor the command anyways, its confusing how autolock is an option
Nothing
882830712087134308
I changed the command, I put only 1 minute of block to close the queue, after 1 minute it opens again, I don't know why this command closes my queue,
what do you mean?
The command I can't disable, so I made it close the queue for 1 minute, then stay open the whole time
what happens when you disable auto_lock
it doesn't work, the queue locks up again, even if I click false
when was the last time you tried
last time you ran the command, you set it to True
yesterday I was testing to configure the on/off command
so I put a 1 minute block on the queue
try it again
its changed
i just tried
Now only tomorrow, thanks Neatz
<a:cat_kiss:926271726772453438>
Neatz can you help me with queue it‚Äôs still broken idk why when two people join it it doesn‚Äôt start
sure i‚Äôll join when u are ready
that server has over 10k but the bot joined
like longtime before that
that is not supposed to happen lul
so thats the new premium thing, but you should have it ü§î one min
ok all good
try now
let me know when its fixed
good?
im waiting
on another member
oh lol
kids
i swear to god
<@145305657237700608> my members having this issue
whats the server id
one sec
how do you get that again
which one of these lol
530525696670564362
k should be fixed
I am both Admin for Mr-Napkin and Boxule
and my own server
wayprotein chad too
Only servers I have and I am admin for are 
Mr-Napkin 
Spike (My Own Server
Boxule Community
ye was just pointing out that server, I have a command that lets me find mutual servers for anyone
helpful for debugging when people have an issue
all good
Makes my heart sing seeing those servers
Any way
when making lobby detials
Anyway we could show lobby details like this 

Like this format below 

Host 
Lobby 
Password
Just thinking about a phone user
yea you can use \n to signify a line break
Lobby: QUEUENAME \n Password: PASSWORD5
really
yep discord format wack
didnt know that
no its not a discord thing
i dont think its possible normally inside a slash command
I will try that
hey <@145305657237700608> the bot got messed up and is doing all the pick teams stuff etc. in the queue text channel instead of making its own
enable tempchannels with /tempchannels enable
preciate it
Can u join now?
just did
Hey Neatz
Thanks alot
Thank you very much
great bot with a create creator
great*
no prob lol
Hey I'm trying to use NeatQue for a leaderboard. I'm close I'm just wondering if someone can help me. Ive got a concept made in my server, just don't think I'm doing it right.
<@145305657237700608>
Sure whats up
Dm'd
How do o get rid of the elo and also get rid of it so that it makes u pick the winner
You can hide MMR changes with `/mmr change hidden`
So you dont want to pick a winner?
I know it seems weird but no
you can do /voteforresults False
Wow you are a legend
I can't see the queue channel, it's private
I tested my two accounts, one with adm can see the queue, the other without the adm role can't see the queue
that‚Äôs how it works by default, only people in the queue get access to the channel
I have two accounts, one can see the queue lobby and the other can't.... It appears that there is no message in the lobby, I can't vote for the winner
two accounts have the role of the queue
you didnt finish the match setup so thats why there is no winner message
as for why one account wouldnt be able to see messages, that is outside of my control (if they both actually have the same perms)
How to get rid of this?
thats what happens when someone leaves the queue mid-setup
its not possible with /tempchannels enabled
I turned off tempchannels will it be good now?
turn on tempchannels and it wont be possible to leave mid setup
Is it possible to make them have a delay so once they Q they can‚Äôt Re Q for a set amount of time?
delay when, like after they get a match?
yeah
once they Q with someone they have to wait say like 1 minute before entering the Q agin
nah you cant do that, what would be the use case?
it‚Äôs confusing
not too sure what you mean
people can only be in the queue once anyways
can you connect two queues to one leaderboard
yes but they must have the same name
The queue channels?
the actual queues
all stats are tied to the queue name
How do I get rid of this?
And how do I make it stop pinning them
neither are possible rn
i could've swore the first one was toggleable though
but I did it before in my other channel and I just forgot how
recently?
oh I got it you just have to set the /team thing to unfair
now I just have to remember how to make it not pin the game
what is this in regard to
<#910981294937210930>
i know what you mean though, there definitely was a command to allow reshuffle before
one more thing is how do I see the leaderboard for a Q without typing /leaderboard in the same channel as it
I want a commands channel for that instead of typing in the same channel that my Q is in
you can use /link to link a non queue channel to a queue channel
then the command will  work there
tysm and the leaderboard is cool af
thanks!
Is there a way that when you have different roles when queuing they can receive more/less MMR depending on what they queue as
nah, mmr changes are standard to the entire queue
<@145305657237700608>
thanks
another question, sorry. But is there any way to have a certain role always be captain?
I don‚Äôt believe so sorry.
thank you
Is there a way for map bans to be selected by captains instead of the whole team?
not currently no, it‚Äôs only per team max
this is because there are other team selection modes, so it makes it work for all
Is there a way to move all the settings including stats along with the queue to another channel?
so you can use /save and /load to transfer configs to different channels/servers
all stats are based on the queue name though, so if it‚Äôs the same name the stats stay
I‚Äôm trying to reset the stats for all my queues but the leaderboard isn‚Äôt showing that they are all back to 0
is it showing the stats as the same?
Yeah I did the stats reset and it‚Äôs not putting them back to 0
looks like the stats are actually reset, either the leaderboard isnt refreshed totally or there is something weird with your discord caching that image
i would just refresh the leaderboard a few more times
if that didn't work, copy and paste the image link here plz
So I'm not sure if this bot is able to do this seems to do 60% of what I'm looking for but it could be me not setting it up right. idk?

So it does the Capitan voting and team picking for captains- prefect

As far as the maps, is there a way for the bot to pick 4 maps randomly 2 for each team from a list of 20 maps? 

We are trying to set up "Wars" with it and have the 2 teams be able to pick which map they want from the 2 maps randomly picked their team.
So that situation is a bit harder
With `/map selection map_choice:Random`, you can randomly select a map
If you want 4 maps, you could use `/bestof 4`
it might be easier though to just use `/votingmenu` and add your own custom votes
a third option is using `/lobbydetails set` and providing random selections inside there
ok thank you! I will try all of that out see if it works for us
np! the first option is the easiest but it would say "Best of 4", which idk if that applies to you
As long as the bot pops out 4 maps from the 20 I entered. The players can just pick the 2 they want and create the game server with the 2 maps and a 3rd predetermined equal map for tie breaker.
yup that would basically do that
Sweet!
hello <@145305657237700608> , is there a way to automate / forcestart or / ping functions? 

for example automatically /forcestart vote when there are 2 in the queue

for example, /ping (queue members, not a role) whenever someone new joins a queue

or /ping before /timer afk action
`/forcestartsize` has an option for auto_start, so it will auto start the vote if the conditions are within what you specified
damn. i missed that. thanks that could be very helpful. i'll try
<@145305657237700608> doesn't seem to work. i set the minimum size at 2, and autostart true... but still no vote
actually it did work, but some 5 minutes later. expected outcome?
yes its not instant, this gives time for more players to join
it does the vote when it thinks nobody else is gonna join
its about 3 minutes
Is there a way to auto lock the queue when a match is in progress and unlock after the match is complete
not currently, how come you would want that?
<@145305657237700608> can‚Äôt get this to work I gave the bot administrator but I‚Äôm not 100% sure on how to get the ‚Äúmessage ID‚Äù of a message
if you right click the message the very last option would be Copy Id
i think you need developer mode on though
how do I turn that on? And what does it do?
Settings -> Advanced -> Developer mode
pretty sure all it does is let you see IDs
wasn't sure of a better way to do it all in a command
How do I make a 1v1 queue
Like 1 team of 2
you would want 2 teams of 1
`/teamsize 1`, `/numberofteams 2`
or `/startqueue queuename:1v1 teamsize:1`
what‚Äôs the difference between elo and mmr
or are they just the same thing
same thing, i dont think NeatQueue references ELO anywhere
Yo is there a way where in stead of teams having separate vcs they can use one?
not currently, each team eithers gets their own voice channel, or you can disable voice channels
Is it possible to create roles that signify what role a player plays in game. For instance how a moba has support, mid, adc, etc. or are the only roles one's bound to your mmr?
not with autoroles, you could get it to work using reactionroles
but it could be added to autoroles though
and the bot will take those roles into account when randomizing teams?
if you are looking for roles in terms of the game, you should use /roles
players will select a role when they queue and the teams will be limited to the roles you selected per team
ex: `/roles Tank,DPS,DPS,Support,Support` will be 1 tank, 2 dps, 2 supports per team
<#915811627855646730>
I'll give it a shot thanks for the help
when a game is canceled players aren't sent back to the original channel. instead they are just disconnected from discord. is this intended?
when a match is complete i can confirm people aren't sent back to last channel
you will need to use
./lobbychannel returnall toggle:
i think that should be enabled by default perhaps
is there a way to make a decay floor that isn't the total mmr floor for instance if our mmr floor is 0 can i make it so the decay floor is 1000
not currently, there is only a single floor setting
so how much is it to upgrade more than 50games a day?
<@145305657237700608> how do I buy the 5 dollar one?
https://www.neatqueue.com
just login and navigate to your server in the dashboard tab
Anyone able to help me setup the bot for a Valorant server?
Sure
Dm me
I‚Äôll run you through it
it says people are still in the queue even though it popped
in rare cases the queue message doesn‚Äôt refresh when the match starts
probably just a visual bug
nvm its good lol
why sometimes there are counting one match as two or more
not too sure what you mean, do you have any screenshots or something?
this was send after one game
thats very strange
are they all sent at once?
I was looking for a simple queue system, to control the players who want to play with me in my lives. And I found this wonderful work, there are more things than I can use.

Is there any way to translate bot responses to my language? is this possible or the code does not allow for individual translation by servers.
unfortunately NeatQueue does not support any other languages, there are too many commands and informational/error messages that such an undertaking would take a ton of work. Also, NeatQueue was created before Discord supported localizations which didn't help
maybe some day in the future, but its not really on my radar right now D:
OK thank you!!
Is there any way to give someone a specific amount of elo
you can use /set mmr or /add mmr
yes they were all sent at once
<@145305657237700608> will look into it tomorrow as he is in bed now, please be patient and have a good rest of your night/day‚ù§Ô∏è
was this through normal voting? or using a command to select results
Button team 2 Under this message
now i set it to tie to cancel mmr changes
ah so you clicked the team button to select the winner, not through the normal winner vote
is there a chance multiple admins clicked it at once?
Yep, there is a small chance
You think this is the reason?
yes i do since there is no safe guard to prevent concurrent winner selections through that admin message
in the normal winner selection, it‚Äôs not possible for multiple people to activate it
so i‚Äôll need to implement a lock for this
Okay, at this moment i will tell admins to don't abuse this buttons and wait for vote to end
Thanks for help
i would suggest letting players vote anyways ü§∑
is there a way to put the rating in name to the left?
no :/
not currently
Hi, i ve a problem with a queue
what is it?
what is wrong with it
is a lot of spam, when someone leaves or enters a queue, I need to put it in the same message.
./queuemessage history toggle:Disabled
that‚Äôs the default
so someone must have changed it in your queue
ty, I love your work
thanks!
Hi man, i ve a problem
what is it?
May I write u by direct message?
sure
so im having an issue where my queue's fill up but when the game goes to start it just empties it
worked lastnight and nothing was changed
<#919709100114346076>
what‚Äôs your server name?
invited you
and ty mb i didnt see
the announcement
can‚Äôt join since i‚Äôm not home, but i see you are hitting the error
best thing you can do is disable tempchannels and voicechannels
discord is not letting the bot create more channels in your server, not sure why
thats weird
there is a 500 new channels limit per server, but you probably aren‚Äôt hitting that so idk
yeah i dont think weve hit that yet lol
leaderboard online page not working
Neat-Z is most likely asleep, he will be with you tomorrow (6+ hours unless he wakes up earlier) 
Please be patient ‚ù§Ô∏è
cmon man what time you think I wake up
fixed
hello i have a question, i was wondering if i can see the current list of who i have banned from queuing or do i just have to remember, and unban from memory?
Thank you!
hmmm no there isn't a way to see that lol
ill add a command
.suggest Command to view banned players
Your suggestion has been submitted to the server staff for review!
Oh thank you! the bot is awesome btw thank you so much!
thanks üòÑ
im trying to set up a community game day for my discord members, and i wanted to ban certain players that were in the previous day to give a chance to other members to be on the team. and then unban them if nobody queues up. but i forgot who i banned ü§£
yea guess you cant figure that out, when they try and queue it would say they are banned tho ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
oh got it , for now ill just mention everyone and say if you are banned lmk and ill unban ü§£
i think u can create a role and then give to the players that you want to ban from the queue, just use the command /bannedroles
oh thats a good idea!
true thats a better approach, thanks!
how do i put up the queue unlimited. it keeps kicking for inactivity
i just want people to join a queue and the plan is to have it next wednesday
and when it creates the 2 channels (text and voice) i want to delete the channels manually and have them stay there until i delete them. if thats possible üôÇ
and they have unlimited time to join the voice channel üôÇ
you can disable afk kicks with `/timer afk toggle:False`
channels will only ever last for as long as the match itself, so you would just adjust the max match length for automatic cleanup
Use `/lobbychannel timer ` to specify how long people have to join the queue voice channel
you're the best thank you!
whats the command for the automatic cleanup one?
`/timer matchcleanup`
after that timer the winner be auto selected, which corresponds to the channels being deleted
thank you so much!
no prob üòÑ
Even with afk kick timer disable I still got removed for ‚Äú60 minutes of inactivity‚Äù
But 3 hours later ü§î
oh sorry that‚Äôs not afk kick
./timer queuereset seconds:
oh okay ! sweet!
I need help with the register portion of the bot ot isnt letting people register in my server
sure whats up
This is the error message that im getting back by a server member
Non admin status
No roles
`/requireregister mode:Manually` requires the Admin to register the player's starting rating
if you dont want that, just turn it off
its meant for if you want players to submit their rank to an Admin for verification, or you want to build a third party register system which initializes the player's rating
Will my mmr system work still to auto update roles ?
I have siege mmr setup 2500 start p0-999999 mmr copper -champ
Champ thresh is 5k
Champ cap none
Now it says theres no need to register but i want my players registered for siege mmr
All that register does is set the starting mmr for each player
so it doesn't effect your auto roles at all
Ok so if players register it will set there mmr to whatever it is in game?
yea if the game is supported
and the API is used didn't break/change lol
Is R6 still valid??
Its seems to be working
its using r6stats.com so looks good to me
How do I make it so it hides whos in queue
</anonymousqueue:998281213334794445>
Ok i have a list if things im struggling to figure out 

1. How to set both ingame mmr and inserver mmr to seprate roles so it seperates by in game and assigns a role for matchmaking 

2. How to setup map voting (it doesn‚Äôt shown up in my queue when we get a game )
You have to add maps by doing
/map add
Then name the maps u want
Then name the maps u want
Cant help you with the first one sorry.
there is no separate role mmr, but you can do /roles to specify roles for the game
Is there a way to reset registrations?
you would have to just reset mmr
`/resetstats mmr`
hmm true
ill add a reset command
Thankyou
actually i changed the behavior a bit
you can now re-register after resetting mmr
but it doesn't force you
How do you delete team names ü§î
like go back to default?
Yeah
Like party names
delete parties, or change teamnames?
team names meaning the name of a team when its formed lol
Yeah just in the case if a team name is not appropriate
Cause you can make party names but can't delete them in admin mode
yea i can make it so /party disband will let an admin disband any party
Yeah that be perfect
Hey i was wondering what command do i use to reset all players elo back to what i want it to be?
you can do /resetstats mmr, which will remove everyone‚Äôs mmr
you can do /resetstats mmr, which will remove everyone‚Äôs mmr
so when they requeue for the first time they will get their respective /startingmmr
i enabled the Show queue history function in the hope to be able to set up an autoresponder that detects "joined/left" to ping a specific role when someone "joins" or "leaves" .... but sadly couldn't find a bot that can read from embeds, all of them can read normal text only ... any suggestion for a workaround?
well you could make your own bot lol, it would be about the same
neatqueue also has webhooks, i could add a webhook for when players join/leave the queue
i feel like pinging a role every time someone joins/leaves is alot
Hello, just some quick questions  (for cod)                      1. When 8 people join the queue and the teams are assigned, where exactly do they go? Will they automatically be placed in voice chats I have created or will they need to decide which one to go into?             2. Once a game is completed, how does the reporting work to reflect elo? Will I or a mod need to monitor this at all times and manually report?
hi!

1. (Default settings) When the queue fills up, a temporary voice channel is created so all players must join to ready up. From here, team selection will begin. After teams are created, players are automatically moved to their team channels
2. After teams are finalized, a message appears in the channel with buttons to vote for the winning team. Players should vote after the match finished. By default this is a majority vote, so you don't need a mod to monitor the results
man thats awesome, thank you for the quick response(you'll probably see me a lot in here as i'm trying to build a large community with elo matches!)
Last question, I set the maps, but I'm not sure how to set the game modes. So there might be 2 game modes available for one map if that makes sense.
np, you set the gamemode for a map when you add it with `/map add`, its just an optional argument
itll say +1 more
so basically /map add (name of the map) (space) (name of gamemode)
and I can add multiple game modes after the map name?
not quite
you need to provide it in the game_mode field if you want the bot to obey the gamemode selection
Hey NeatZ, when I play the first map, I have it set to best of 3 but it makes us report after the series so it wont autogenerate all 3 maps it only generates one. Also one more thing, how do I get the ELO score to appear on a players name automatically?
hmm if its bestof 3 it should provide 3 maps for you in the final teams message
what does it look like for you?
Did you specify thats its a best of 3?
`/bestof 3`
Yea but ill do the command again after this one
It would/should say at the top that its a Best of: 3
Okay thank ypu
what about the elo next to their name?
that would be `/ratinginname`
you're awesome thank you
what do i set the format as?
for ratinginname
you can keep it the default
which is - ($)
Is the bot down? )':
something is up  but its on Discords end, not mine
they're loving the elo system, you did your thing brother ‚ù§Ô∏è
idk what its doing
it just pulled us into the queue but it wont start the team matchup and it wont let me cancel so we're just doing it manually so it seems like its trying to work but wont react to commands
yea the bot is trying to catchup but seems to be bogging itself down
its up now
yea i did a full restart, not sure what would even cause that
Is there any way of customing the embed the bot generates for queue?

I had this before and would really like to jazz up the queue embed
The emoji were linked to check on whether the user had specific roles
not but i could add maybe a few presets to spice it up
That'd be sweet.
Hey NeatZ, quick question, is there a way the bot will allow me to show the players Elo in the actual discord and not just the leaderboard?üëÄ
show it where, like in their name?
/leaderboard /stats /compare all shows stats too
yea like on the right hand side on their server name, i just wasnt sure if that was possible or if it only showed on the embedded messages in the queue
yea you can use /ratinginname
neatz is there a way of achieving a flex queue for the role queue?
no not currently
.suggest Flex queue for role queue
Your suggestion has been submitted to the server staff for review!
Hey <@145305657237700608>, is there a way to make a map ban system, where team captains only, take turns to ban maps one by one, team 1 choses 1 which removes it from the choices, then team 2 is  allowed to vote, ect. If it isnt available right now, would love this feature for competitive siege, thx in advance
yup, `/map bans` lol
ohhhh, I didnt see it lol, thx
Hey, anyway to do a factory reset in some way, and start fresh, as helping my buddy out, and idk what he did XD
you can reset stats with /resetstats, or delete a queue with /endqueue
Hey NeatZ, good afternoon brother.
Quick question
When I enter /numberoflobbies and put 3, which is how many lobbies I want going at once, it makes the queue 0/24 so I wasnt sure if once 8 people got into the queue, will it create a lobby?
Because I wasnt sure I had it on /numberoflobbies (1,) once the first 8 fill up, will the bot create another lobby once another queue is filled with 8, or will it make us wait until the first lobby is concluded?
no it will wait until 24 people join, and create 3 matches at the same time
So if I have it set to '1' lobby once the first lobby is created, will it still create another lobby once another 8 join even if there's currently a game going?
yea queues never end
once a queue fills up, it is emptied and ready for more players
Thank you üôèüèΩ
how do i set it up i have it downloaded and is says use slash setup
yes, do /setup
are leaderboards down?
looks fine to me
<@145305657237700608> would love a way to limit the amount of votes needed during a map ban phase so it doesnt take forever, meaning if 3 people vote for 1 map, it doesnt wait for the other 2 to vote, as sometimes someone is afk
you can change the voting requirement with /requiredvotes
heyya sometimes it wont allow anyone to vote after a series, any ideas?
what happens, what do you see?
what happens when you click
it would say match not found
hmmm that is strange
that would only happen if the match didn‚Äôt make it to the database, i don‚Äôt see any errors though
i have a queue thats been up for months that wont let me update its size, copying and loading the queue in another channel still doesnt let me change the queue size (KZQXT)
if i make a new queue it lets me update the size
hit join queue and see if the message updates
probably just a visual bug
or /clearqueue
hmmm
so if you change the teamsize now, nothing happens?
thats weird
its showing that your settings are changing
not sure why the queue message is showing old settings
is there a way to see all the changes made to a queue? id happily just make a new queue but idr all the settings i put
usually you would just save the config and load it but you said thats not working
whats the current config code if you /save?
BPRTM
ahh i found it
you have a /queuesizeoverride
i always forget that exists lol, i really dont think it should
what does that do
it locks the queuesize to whatever you set it, despite the teamsize/number of teams/etc
/queuesizeoverride size:0  to remove it
lmao that makes sense
sorry to have wasted your time and thanks!
no prob!
Hey guys any idea how to remove Automatically Assign Roles from queues?
/autoroles remove
<@145305657237700608> hey, we disabled voting for result as people were lying or voting before the game is done, but moderating it would be too much, but problem is, it also stops admins from receiving the vote for result to override there results, which is really annoying lol
its a majority vote so its kinda hard for a match to get wrong results, if people are voting too early you can delay the message with
yes, but we wanted to lower the vote requirement for map bans, but it also lowered it to 3 for the vote for result too
`/timer winnervotemessage`
hmmm yea all voting is synced currently
yeahhh, anyway you can unsync them for later please
would be nice
meh i kinda like the simplicity of them all being the same
people voting for the wrong team shouldnt really be much of an issue cuz it wont swing the vote
well anyway to unsync map votes then
it takes too long 5
you can lower the voting timer
hmmm, good idea, thx
didnt think of that lol
for the current game, cant seem to find a way to manually using a command decide the winner
last question for a while lol, since I fixed back the voting system, but it isnt active for this game lol
what is the question? how to decide a winner manually?
yes pls
using the game code
`/outcome`
1 more question lol, any chance I can turn of embeds for the que chats to stop meme spam without manually changing it every time?
<@145305657237700608>
I don't want these things to appear
I want to start the game
change the `/teamselection`
you need to choose teams somehow
oh its a 1v1
ahaa
just make it balanced
ty pro ‚ù§Ô∏è
no prob
Is there Match log ?
<@145305657237700608>
yea use `/staffchannel` to post history there
It does not work
it does work
make sure bot has perms
It doesn't really work
you  gotta give some more info
<@145305657237700608>
correct
it's not working
Does it have to end game ?
until it appears
you need to play a match
Does it have to end game ?
Can you go into the group and do it for me?
you need teams to be finalized before it will show
I don't understand you
just follow what the bot says
No explanation video bot NeatQueue
correct, i haven‚Äôt made any official tutorial videos
planning to eventually
keep working Good
nice Bot NeatQueue
<@145305657237700608>
I want to add team 1 and team 2
try `/queueintoteam` and set to true
Can you do a bot like this ÿü
what do you mean add team 1 and 2
you gotta explain more
I did it
noone can vote its grayed out üôÇ
seems to be doing it after every series now..weird
<@145305657237700608>  I want it random team
`/queueintoteam false`
Our bot is bugging when the queue is complete it doesn't drag us into the channel but it creates it. The bug only happened today
<@145305657237700608> ?
I can't add Aduit log
It does not work
<@145305657237700608>
yea i changed the way the winner vote delay works. before it would just pop u the message later, but people would be like ‚Äúwhere is the vote‚Äù
the delay should be the same, it‚Äôs just with button disabled instead of message hidden
when the match finishes it won‚Äôt drag into the lobbychannel?
correct, free tier is 3 channels
no when the number of players are complete it doesn't drag everyone into the queue channel for team picking
I want Aduit log game Queue <@145305657237700608>
And it doesn't work
idk what that means sorry
do you have a lobby channel set?
<@145305657237700608>
I don't want this list to appear
And I want to know how to finish the game
follow what the bot says, it will show a winner message at the end
I did this and it shows up again
you set it to the Default Menu then
I don't understand you
do `/teamselection type:Balanced`
I want this to appear in another channel
`/resultschannel`
Can I change these numbers?
I want it every game 3 point lost
`/mmr change set amount:3 static:True`
How do I remove player points?
<@145305657237700608>
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=modify-player-data
`/set mmr`
`/resetstats`
How do I know how many points I have?
`/leaderboard ` `/stats`
ty ‚ù§Ô∏è
Someone could tell me why with voice channel required, there are no voice channels which appears for me when i test it in test mode on my server ?
The bot is in admin with full rights btw
what happens when you fill a queue?
just skips to team setup?
When i fill it i got this
then this
but no voice channels
on another server i got them
and voicechannels are enabled
or required i don't remember
did you maybe change the `/channel category`?
you can also `/save` the config and send it for me to test
oh true
UXRXP
here is the code
yea it works fine for me
mmhh
and what is channel category i didn't change this
by default it is "Parent" where the category is whatever category the queue channel is in
shouldnt matter, the channel would be created anyways
maybe permissions or ?
i got only the queue xD
only on this server
weird
only thing i can think of is permissions
since the code works for me
ok i will see that then ty
you can invite me if you want me to look
yeah but i'm not admin on it so it will be complicated
Do the bot has to be on top of all roles ?
or it works fine like this ?
Permissions for the bot seems to be ok because Allowing create/modify/remove rooms is on
it should be on top of all roles in order for autoroles to work
Even the admin role ?
above any role Neatqueue assigns
Ok !
Can we got discord names on results for queue for staff only instead of nicknames ?
only if you switch all names to not be nicknames
`/nametype`
im gonna switch the staff only message to use mentions though, that seems better
like pings ?
and i dit it by putting all names by discord names but it doesn't work
On their server my name is SaskeUchiha lol
Awe is my nickname
id have to look into it, that feature is super old and i dont think its very useful
switching to mentions will be better anyways
results for staff isn't useful ?
no, switching between nicknames and discord names
but mentions will display the nickames right ?
yes but its a mention so you can click the name and view the profile
it was interesting to have the choice between both imo
the feature should work, idk why it wouldnt
idk lol
when you enter the queue it just updates your name in the database based on that setting
maybe the test mode ?
do you want my save code ?
Queue configuration saved as: DSSYN
i just tried it out and it seemed to work
i'll retry wait
just make sure you re-enter the queue after changing the settings
anyone still in the queue has their old name
without validate scores
i got this
here its ok
here its not
and here its not
when you set nametype to Discord and join queue, do you see the Discord name or nick name
no because its anonymous
disable it for a sec and check
it works
well no, thats the wrong name right
above on the screen its my nickname but the mention is my discord name which is the right name
if you have it set to Discord names, they should be the same
weird
it stills putting me SaskeUchiha until i go to results for staff which is my nickname Awe that is displayed ans its not right on their server
can you invite me to see
sure
<@145305657237700608> How do I get one out scrim ?
How do I enter one instead of one?
<@145305657237700608>
bro what
You speak arabic ?
How do I remove one from the match?
player
`/player remove`
ahaa
hey pro
The bot adds the names of the maps?
I want it
<@145305657237700608>
/map
Can I delete this?
if you don‚Äôt want a winner /voteforresults
Yo what it means timer for matchcleanup ?
after how long will the match automatically resolve a winner
by default, after 5400 seconds, whichever team has the most votes will be selected as the winner
Can I add pictures to the map?
<@145305657237700608>
no that‚Äôs not possible
nice bot <@857633321064595466>
good job pro
Can the bot add ROMs?
Example: Fox 1 Channel 2 pw 500
<@145305657237700608>
like a lobby name and password?
How do i take aways mmr
i can only add mmr  to players
not remove
you can add a negative value
<@145305657237700608>
yes check out https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobbydetails-set
<@145305657237700608>
What does Anticheat do because I don't understand a thing
it flags players who may be abusing the system
and notifies staff
yo what is the diffenrece between points and MMR ?
and how can i disabled points ?
points are just gained for every match played, can be used for predictions
you can disable predictions with /predictions
its already done but how can i disabled points on leaderboards ?
or when we use the statsbutton
points are displayed but i don't need them actually
you can‚Äôt hide those
and how can i set it up for everyone in one shot ?
i can only add points by users
what do you mean
i wanted to configure it at 1 point per win or maybe put 0 to disabled it
currently you can‚Äôt customize point rewards
okok that's why
Hi ! Can we send results on fils for a channel ?
fils?
cancel vote not working what can i do?
they voting yes but game is not cancel
what happens? I just tried it out and it cancelled fine
but not working on my queques
players voting yes for cancel vote
but nothing happened
maybe i missed command? like / ...
do you have any screenshots of it?
not now
but they opening cancel vote
with /cancel
and they voting yes and no
but cancel is not working
it was working yesterday
its hard to know whats going on without a screenshot at least
is it during team setup, or after teams are finalized
finalized
when is 1 player afk
they using cancel
i changed so much things
team names & sizes
vote timer & channel timer
and cancel not working now
is the cancel vote ending?
they voting yes and no
nothing happens and the buttons are bugged
In order for the vote to end, you need a vote to have a majority vote, or the vote timer must run out
this would be easy to tell whats happening with a screenshot though
otherwise im just guessing
i will send screenshoot soon
<@145305657237700608>
like this bro
nothing work
nobody voted
the vote failed
when YES is 5 or 6
and same
i tested 5-6 times
and doesnt work
I probably changed a some settings
can you /save the config and paste it here
The mmr list is not reset, right?
after save?
correct saving doesn't change anything
just creates a sharable config
Queue configuration saved as: PQIJE
done?
yup perfect
your voting requirement is 7
thats probably the issue
bcs they troll voting
for winner
i did 7
all the voting requirements are shared, so even in the case for cancelling
a majority vote should be enough
okay i will change req for 6
in order to troll a vote, you would need winners voting for the wrong team
and i will test
i did 6 now i will test
and i will back to you
thanks
its done bro <@145305657237700608>
need (6) for works
epic
and i ask something
If someone leaves discord while waiting in queque, does it automatically exit the queue?
like offline
It used to, but not anymore
the tournament queue is not appearing, its not live yet?
There are 400k users in all NeatQueue servers, its impossible to keep up with the status updates for each person and check if they are in queue
thats weird, try again?
I saw you hit an error with starting a tournament with 0 people, that shouldnt be the issue though
nothing is happpening
what was the tournament name?
was breakit league
now i made test 2 to see
I do see an error on my end
it complained about the url for the bracket, i thought maybe the tournament had a name with special characters?
it has a space in the name
thats why
i need to account for that...
this explains a lot xd
good find, never even tested that
done, should be fixed in next update
alright, thanks a lot
<@145305657237700608>
how can i give perm
for /stats
users cannot use
everyone can use that command by default
but you can change slash command permissions in the servers integrations settings
i fixed thanks
You can have two queues with 2 separate leaderboards right?
yup, just name the queues 2 different things
stats are tied to the queue name
<@145305657237700608>
what is player's pick option?
in que room?
each player can select the team they want to join
can i close this opinion?
no it‚Äôs either all options or one
how can i select
only captains?
./teamselection
thanks
<@145305657237700608>
how can i buy premium?
https://neatqueue.com/, just login with Discord and select your server
where is server select
i pay when is active for premium?
<@145305657237700608>
its done thanks
and can i create multiple ranked system right?
yes you can
premium is automatically activated too
thanks for going premium !
how can i create for second?
i need to use different name right?
for different leaderboard
exactly yes
this bot is really great thanks for developing
thanks!
can i create divisions for que?
like a 0-300 mmr
300-1000 mmr
queques
you can either add an /mmrrequirement or /rolerequirement
or rank system
yea, use /autoroles
to assign roles based on MMR
thanks
np, i would suggest creating a role for each division, using autoroles to specify the MMR range for that division, and then lock each queue to the divisions role
do i need to create different queues for this?
like #1 #2 #3
yea for this approach
mating time will be extended
probably
you can use 1 queue but you cant lock it to any division
but that works well too, cuz people still get special roles
depends how many people you have queuing
i would use just 1 queue unless you have at least 50-100 people queuing total
yeah im using one que for now
maybe i can create divisions later
and some time role ques are bugged
like (3/2) for 2 slot role
and they starting with more 1 player
what i can do for fix?
by default a role can have a waiting room
but the player shouldnt be in the match, that would be a bug
yeah players in game
like
if they lose game
6 people losing MMR
or 6 people gain MMR
i closed role que  because of this problem
any screenshots of this?
you can disable the waiting room though
`/waitingroom`
i dont have
i will send you if i have
how can i close - MMR <@145305657237700608>
i want lowest mmr is 0
like i have 25 MMR
i lose -28
but still 0
not -3
`/mmr floor 0`
and how can update
- mmr players to 0?
will be updated auto?
no you will need to `/set mmr`  to 0
or reset the mmr
ah okay
if he lose when he have - mmr
can be bugged?
or he will be 0?
it should stay at the negative number
but not go lower
okay
actually it might put them to 0
i cant remember
i updated - mmrs to 0
no problem
i did mmr floor 0
but still they going to -
like
i dont want - mmrs
what does it show in ur /info page 3
for lowest assignable mmr
should be fine then
but still they -
in the leaderboard?
yeah
i can share link here?
sure
https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/1044939953882284113/1046508232161640498
look 126 & 127
they was 0 MMR
when they lose they got - mmr
set them to 1 mmr and try
ah okay
i did i will back to you tomorrow
/queuemessagee
Is there an audit log?
<@145305657237700608>
audit log for what?
and its working thanks
<@145305657237700608>
when is restart daily games?
Depends on the first game played that day
or just time?
It resets 12pm EST
Same time the bot posts in <#935731235790139422>
and how can share leaderboard
in different channel?
i cant use like /leaderboards ... ... system
in another channel
channel for only leaderboard
error like > No queue found!
If you want a queue in this channel, run /startqueue or /setup!
If you want to control a specific queue from this channel, use /link
you can use /link to link to the queue channel
although if you only have 1 queue, every channel will be linked to the queue channel
and /stats not working now
i have 2 que for now
yup thats why
its done
sorry im asking so much bro
but i learned so much thing üòÑ
no prob, a lot of stuff
yeah this bot is really great
the dev is amazing too! üôÇ Neatz appreciation day
thanks guys lol
how can i fix
multi ques? <@145305657237700608>
he is in game but still joining que
`/multiqueue Disabled`
thanks
Is there a way to lower the required amount of people to report a win?
Like for now our 10mans needs 5 people to report the win after the game
Or something like that
Is there a way to lower it to like 1 or 2?
all the voting requirements are the same, but you can change them with `/requiredvotes`
Ah right
So if I change that it‚Äôll change to lower for the required votes for like captains or randoms as well? <@145305657237700608>
That‚Äôs not ideal
Also while I‚Äôm here, is there a way to turn off the options for randoms and highest elo and make it so the lobby is just captains?
exactly
yea you can change it with `/teamselection`
and change how captains are selected with `/captain selection`
Ah cool thanks
Is it possible to have the options as just captains or random?
Or can you only have one?
sorry no currently its either all or one
tyla got more mmr than juan cruz even tho he was higher mmr before the match, is this a bug?
opposing team was higher mmr overall
depends to streaks
like win streak & lose streak
its his first match
also streaks are off
idk then
can i create teams que?
points will go to teams not players
probably i can with partys right?
yea teamqueue works with parties
placements are off too?
how does placements work?
multiplier for first 10 matches
how can i open or close?
I couldn't find the command
mmr change set
i want to join que with 5 player but team players is 10
and cant join with 10 team player
Can't we choose the players to join?
not too sure what you mean
if you want the teamsize to be 5 instead of 10?
Like
how can i select players for que?
team size is 2 now
you can‚Äôt
it must be the entire party
you would need a new party of 2 people only
So when you win, will it be reflected as a team in the rankings or is everyone separate?
Like JBL is 90 MMR or Paris +30, Bola +30 or something
all stats are individual still
ah okay i understund
i will with TAG then like [JBL] ...
and with solo que system
yes, is it just a bug or some kind of mechanic?
it‚Äôs a mechanic
What for tho? Lower mmr people shouldn‚Äôt get less mmr than higher mmr people for beating the same opponents
by default they don‚Äôt
since there are streaks and placement match multipliers
I have both turned off
Yet that still happens
in the mmr calculation it takes into account your own mmr vs the teams mmr as well
if a low mmr player is on a team that has a higher average mmr, they will gain slightly less since they likely didn‚Äôt contribute as much as they other players
can you do the things i mentioned in later updates?
scoring for the team and selecting players when queuing as a team
leads to a really nice system
scoring for a team definitely won‚Äôt be added anytime soon (if ever) cuz the whole bot functions on the idea of individual stats
maybe selecting players though
yeah
because i want to join with Team(Party)
and i have 10 player but i cant join with 10 player
because they can be offline need to select Online players
you would just have to create new parties
for now at least
Middle mmr looses more than average elo while playing against better elo average team and it being first game ever (no placement matches)
can you /save your config
XYVYE
<@145305657237700608> something is bugged
2 same que and
they cant use vote for winner
and i cant select outcome winner
ill check it out later
thats weird, what happens when you try to select outcome
Sure
bot told me - selected winner for #que.....
bot nothing happened
no win for winners
and not closed rooms
thats weird two matches got the same number, the number should be unique
i know
happened 1 time for 6-7 day
happens some times
how can i see their current elo?
im using mmr add 0
check the leaderboard or /stats
and sometimes players enter matches even if they don't join
he is playing game now
and he is already in another que room
but he cant join without winner vote and multi que is closed
did they already vote for a winner
he didnt
but in both games
that player didnt already vote?
i controlled
what is voteforresult?
toggle the match having an outcome or not
i indentified a minor issue where some players have their MMR calculated against the updated enemy team values, which cause weird differences between team members
the only reason i can imagine this happened is you had 2 matches start very quickly
yeah my que's really fast
im making a change so that it should be impossible for 2 matches to have the same number
Will this be patched?
yup in next update, ill probably hotfix in a few hours
Also yeah sometimes it happens in our 3v3 queue that people queue the same team and we get a 4/3 situation
Or even this
We have a 3v3 with 3 roles per team
Sometimes if 2 people of the same role queue up at the same time they get filled even tho it should only be one player per role per team
there is a waitingroom enabled
roles can be overfilled
they just get put into the queue after the match starts
what does Clear User do under a player flag?
they will no longer be flagged for suspicious activity
how can i close predictions for game?
<@145305657237700608>
and 2 active que in same time
possibly another started but not lost
Hello guys, hope you all're doing good, I want to ask about the tournament command, I created the tournament but I cant create the teams with the command /team create
outdated message, it‚Äôs now /party not /team
just a visual bug where the old message couldn‚Äôt get deleted
you can‚Äôt manually close them, it‚Äôs after 3 minutes
you can disable them if that‚Äôs what you mean
i did with 0 seconds for predicts
you should just disable them then
so they don‚Äôt pop up
Thanks! Pretty awesome btw
thanks! tournaments are a super new beta feature so best of luck with it
how can a person join the other match without voting while in a match?
This happened again and the match was cancelled
happens several times a day
maybe they found a bug or something
you shouldn‚Äôt be able to join a second match until you vote for the winner
you don‚Äôt need the winner to be selected, just that you were able to vote
i know and
They can enter another match after the surrender vote.
i tested
that makes sense
elo changes in staff channel not showing?
they should, was a winner selected?
oh maybe not i thought i scrolled up further than i did lol
same players and 2 que <@145305657237700608>
bot created 2 different match for players
hmmm, perhaps two people joined to fill the last spot, and it started a match with each version
Is there any way I can prevent this?
no i will need to fix it
although i thought this issue should have been fixed
even in testing when i have 2 people join at the same exact millisecond, i can't replicate this issue
it shouldnt even be possible imo
idk but happening 2-3 time per day
in my ques
can cause bugs when there is no active admins
probably due to internet
no it wouldnt be due to internet
have you observed the issue at all
like it is cuz a bunch of people queue at once
Thank you so much, I'm gonna test it today so, if I have any feedback I'll tell
once a game is over they all join the queue again
I updated, hopefully should fix the duplicate queue number issue, as well as the discrepancy in MMR changes i mentioned yesterday
Wherever u update the bot, it automatically updates live time too?
Hello! This message is stuck in ... Sending command, server is currently empty so I don't know if anyone else is able to see this. Is there a way I can get rid of it?
strange, but that would be an issue with Discord somehow
I imagine if you restarted your client it would probably go away
sometimes I can hot-reload the entire bot and there is no downtime, othertimes the bot restarts completely which takes about 10 seconds to get back up and running
I see, thanks tho
Restarting fixed the problem, thank you
~~Hello, is there a way to delete a queue? Do I kick & add back the bot?~~ (/endqueue)
some bug about rooms
you have to reload your app
visual glitch with deleted channels
with /reload right?
need save or something*
general rule of thumb, unless the issue is happening to everyone, it‚Äôs outside of my control
but yes reloading the app should fix it
leaderboard continues until we delete it, right?
yup it stays forever
Can I choose the winner myself? <@145305657237700608>
as an admin yes
use /outcome
Okay
Can the bot choose a random password?
yes it can
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobbydetails-set
Can I add someone who controls the bot as well? <@145305657237700608>
And I want to delete all points from all
Can I add a rank when they reach a number of points?
Example : 100 point
Role : PUG TOP 1
<@145305657237700608>
`/staffrole add role:`
`/resetstats mmr  queue_name:`
`/autoroles`
<@145305657237700608> hey m8, the plans on the website need to be paid monthly?
yea, all premium plans are monthly currently
<@145305657237700608> what is the IGN? Also, can I do a way to bot only consider playable players with a specific role?
ign is In Game Name, lets players specify their name
what do you mean about specific roles?
<@145305657237700608>
Can the bot choose a random password?
Choose randomly
This is correct ?
Write this right?
yea just read that section it explains it
Okay
Thank you
I want the bot to move everyone who entered the match
move from where
lobby 1
From Voice Lobby 1
`/lobbychannel pullall toggle:Enabled`
I want to clear all the points and I do not know
^ you already asked these questions brother
truly ?
Sorry
I'm tired lost
This could be the last question
What do I write here
And I want to transfer these channels to another channel dedicated to scrambling
Example
the name of the queue you want to reset stats for
you can omit the argument to reset stats for all queues
move the queue to that category
like, I have 5 roles in my Server, i just want to make people with "Players" role to have access to play
oh, `/role requirement`
How do I cancel a queue a made
It won‚Äôt go away ü§£
`/endqueue`
It wasn‚Äôt working when typed. I had to find it in the list and select it.
I got it though. Thanks
Can I disable the voting to start a que without waiting on votes?
which vote are you talking about ?
To force start it makes a vote occur. I don‚Äôt want that vote. I just want to be able to start it to auto match
hmm no not currently, it must be a vote
Oh that‚Äôs not going to work for what I need then. Thank you
no prob, btw its a vote since queues should run without admin intervention
I need help, it wont let anyone Q rn and the owner is off, is there any commands I can do to reset the Q?
not without an admin, the queue was ended
Yes but it asks for everyone to vote. Im just looking for a bot that auto matches teams after enough joined queue
How do I end the tour <@145305657237700608>
its a majority vote by default, you can change this
also, a match is started once the queue is filled, so just change the queuesize to accurately reflect when you want a match to be started
if its a 3v3 game, the match will start once 6 people join
vote for a winner or use /outcome
What did he choose
whatever you want
What should I write here :<
99385 and the team number
/requiredvotes, but really force start should not be something you rely on
thats not how matches are supposed to be created
thus ?
Based on what I want it for force start is what works for me
whatever the match number is
will team rankings be added soon?
Party rankings
like RMA vs FCB
currently dont have any plans of adding party stats
any ideas
multiple queueing
you have test mode on?
hello i want to ask if i can hide how much players are in the queue
and also there is any option to not let pair players who has a huge mmr gap for ceratin amount of minutes - because it can lead to unfair matches
as i seen this is a first come first serve type of thing, i want to restrict the bot to not pair on the first people who join the queue if it not balanced out
like for example to a 2v2 game
2 high mmr vs 1 high & 1 low mmr
wait another high mmr player for 2 minutes before pairing
no its not possible to only hide the total number of players in queue
the bot doesn't function like ranked matchmaking, everyone in the queue will play
not even the ui?
actually its so close to be perfect
also another question - anticheat rule on flag people who has paired more together than x number of times in a row?
this actually about to prevent queue fixing
you can hide player names in queue with /anonymousequeue
idk about that anticheat rule though, it shouldnt really be an issue to play with the same people
depends how teams are picked
it is actually an issue, thats called match fixing
you cant really match fix when you are on the same team
thats just playing in a party
but if the opponent is the same because nobody plays at that time just 4 people?
they can exploit the system
thats not really exploiting though, you can do that in any game
i can queue rocketleague with the same group of 3 forever
however, if people are intentionally losing a bunch of games in a row, that is already in the anticheat
oh thats great, thats what is needed
thank you
no problemo
also can i ask if that possible to restrict players able join the queue when have certain roles?
yes you can do `/rolerequirement`
oh neat
thanks
so if you wanted you could specify an anticheat flagged role, and add that role to the `/bannedrole`
hey guys, is there anyway to remove a best of one in the voting?
you mean like make the voting best of 3-5?
Is there a feature where it asks people that have been in the queue for an hour if they want to leave or stay? If no reply then it kicks them
yes with `/timer afk`, it looks a bit like this
after clicking Im Here!, it resets the timer
although, the afk timer is also reset by interacting with NeatQueue buttons, joining voice channels, or sending messages
Oooh that‚Äôs sick thanks
how do I get it to show admin nicknames with their MMR? it's working for other users just not me and the creator of the server
bots can‚Äôt rename the server owner, as for the other person just make sure they have perms above them
yessir my voting has best of 1 best of 3 and best of 5. I want to remove the best of 1?
also i just used the command resetall stats and its still saying sending command? does it take a little?
how can i give only que ban permission for mods?
only ban permission
if it just says sending it‚Äôs probably a discord issue, just retry
that should be the default really
anyone with manage_channel perms
or assign a staff role
or change the permissions in your servers Integrations tab
okay i will try
Hey may I ask 2 things, is there any kind of way to only allow 2 people with close elo to get paired together like if I‚Äôm 900mmr i don‚Äôt get paired into 1200
And second question, in the doc says to check docu for explanation on the variance and the way teams are created
But I see no where the explanation
not really, everyone in the queue will be put into the same match
true, idk where it went, one sec
Okay, I was trying to create something like league of legends soloQ where you get matched into people of your same elo, the only workaround I found is to link queues to private rooms based on elo
this calculator shows how variance impacts the output https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ue5labtkpv
if you have a wide range of skills and lots of players, you should probably just make different queues for different skill tiers
NeatQueue is less like matchmaking, more like PUGs
Yeah but it‚Äôs the only one I found cool enough to use
Haven‚Äôt found any nice matchmaking bot
And having to code it would be a pain in the a**
It truly would
So for now we will try but I think sooner than later I will maybe dm you to get info with the payment stuff
I've been thinking of a matchmaking mode, it technically shouldnt be too hard for me to add, just need to think of the details
Yeah whit how well it‚Äôs built
maybe you can configure a max MMR range for the queue, and when you have enough players within the range, it starts a match
If code is some form of cleanly implemented
debatable
You should be able to create a Queue with maybe 10 people
this should be simple though for sure
And just make matches with the ones with the closer mmr
Djbskflsnd as a programmer myself I feel you haha
I‚Äôm running a server with around 500 persons and I‚Äôm guessing it will grow sooner than later
And we want to use the bot for a matchmaking challenge
yea ill check it out, doesnt sound hard and it would be pretty cool
Ty am
If you need any kind of help
Just pm me
My server has reached 1600 members in less than a month because of you guys
i started the server and it blew up with this que system,
how much will you make the premium version of this bot?
looking to be an early investor if anything
Premium exists currently, its 5$ a month for the lowest tier
I think your server has unlimited premium forever though
cuz i gave the first 1,000 servers premium forever
How come?
ohhh
Well tell you what, we will be hosting Tournaments in our server soon. The extra money it produces id be more than happy to donate some back toward you guys
you guys do a fantastic job
Best que bot system on the market. HANDS DOWN
ive been looking into your new tournament feature and its going to go so well with the things we have in place
Lol, your server was the last server to make the cutoff
crazy
your neatque bot might even make us let go of the previous Tournament Bot we have
the exact last!?
Yea your server's join date is the cutoff I chose
random
Totally
holy
but also be careful with Tournaments if you are involving money, its a beta feature that may break
We will 100% will be needing it soon too
no worries
i wont be using the beta
im looking forward to it though
barely anyone has used Tournament yet so I haven't had much feedback into it
fixed a few bugs, but otherwise idk how its working
If you need it we might give it a few trys
Like I will get back to you with the experience
I think the bracket creation is still flawed, ill have to test more
but that would be great thx
Inwill check
I got you,
My team will test it out soon
see i said it wouldnt be hard
You kidding bro
Is there a chance to remove couple of reactions from the reactions section? theres too many votes in my eyes
what section are you talking about?
is there a way to allow certain players to join the room of the valorant queue even if the room is full wihtout giving them an admin role?
<@145305657237700608>
like if i give him a special role like coach how i can do so they have extra slot
in the room
like if the teams are already in the rooms and a coach want to come and be in the team vc while watching the match how can i do so he will always have perms to join the created rooms without giving him admin role
can i add delay for que?
like 1 que for 10 min
other que will come after 10 min
yup /spectatorrole
not really, matches start when the queue is full
i did it but its not letting them join the current game is it going to affect from the next queue?
for*
yea it needs the be enabled when the voice channel is created
it won‚Äôt go back and update old channels
ok i will check when there is new que ty
and if i do it 1 time it saves for every lobby or i need to do it every time after game is over
nope once you change the settings for a queue, every match will reflect the settings
ok thank you
Can you make more affordable prices? I mean, I'm from Brazil and these prices are really high for people from here. A lot of games changes their price around the world and I really like to use this bot but I can't use in a huge server that I've.
same for Turkey bro happens üòÑ
I'll have to look into if there is an easy way to convert the price, I can't just do manually overrides for each currency since thats too much work
if this is possible it will be very good for me, I can't activate many systems due to limits
Is the tournament feature just double elimination or round robin?
just single elim for now
Can I have the bot send a private message to the private room that opens after players join?
example sends one of 5 messages randomly
you can customize the lobby details message
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobbydetails-set
specifically for your case,
`/lobbydetails set message: RANDOM[Message 1, Message 2, Message 3,...]`
thanks
Is there a reason the leaderboard is still telling I need one more person to vote even though I voted already
when did you vote?
2/3 hours ago. Does it take a bit?
hmm no it should be basically instantly
maybe you voted when i was restarting the bot
ill manually fix it
which server?
DudeCrew
It‚Äôs got same logo as my pfp
try now
It‚Äôs working! Awesome bro. Thank you so much
no prob!
im trying to set up a queue for mythic+ in wow, and have a queue setup that has 1 team, requires 3 roles, and has voice as 'optional' but when i click join, i get `This interaction failed`
is your server teststuff?
ill reset it up in the actual live server once i get a proof of concept
there is some bug going on that‚Äôs i can‚Äôt replicate
but if you enable multiqueue it should bypass it
that did it
thanks
is there anything i can provide you to help debug that?
idk really
/save and paste the code maybe
`PZTRX`
<@145305657237700608> can i set a Lobby message with markdown formatting? Is very hard to put all informations needed in the same line
some markdown works like bold, italics, etc, but if you need a new line use /n
ohh nice nice
Also, how can I set the MMR to appear on the nickname of users?
And how can I choose automatically the mode that the bot will make the teams?
/ratinginnames
/teamselection
Nice m8
I'm really waiting for the change in prices
I've 2 servers to use the bot but we have more than 3k of users
but is very hard for us to pay it montly
25 dollars in Brazil is like 140 reais, with it we can buy food for the month for one or two persons
i‚Äôm about to head to sleep but i‚Äôll message you tomorrow about it üôÇ
Nice m8, thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
Have a good night
<@145305657237700608> I'm trying to make the bot change the nickname only of people with an specific role called JOGADORES. But idk why the bot is giving for everyone even that can't join the Queue
<@498310733109526538>
Also I have 1600 members, but only 500 allowed to join the Queue
but idk the bot is making every 1600 count as player
ah yes the 2nd ping now
im a supporter not support
l-o-l, sorry m8
lol i‚Äôll disable pings for that role sorry
if you specify a queuename, it will modify everyone‚Äôs name to show their rating even if they haven‚Äôt queued
if you only want people who have queued, don‚Äôt specify a queuename
and it‚Äôll use the most recent queue
If I remove the bot the players count will restart?
Also I've sent you a message about the paid services in DM
no, the bot doesn‚Äôt delete any data upon leaving a server
How i can add moderator for queues?
no permission but they can see queue rooms for chat
you can specify a staffrole
/staffrole add
but they can use
ban & unban or other commands?
i want only they can see que rooms ( when game is ready )
you can do /spectatorrole
i did
but they dont see que room
i mean
#queue#123123
chat room
hmm true looks like they dont
ill fix that
thanks
because moderators can help people like use /cancel or something
or we can add some commands for spectator role ( they can use vote for winner or something )
nah spectators shouldnt be able to vote for winner
im making it so that staff and spectator roles can see the channel, but spectators can't send messages
okay i understund
The MMR is unique? Or each queue has their own MMR?
MMR is tied to the queue name
so if you name queues the same, the stats will be shared
how can i reset player MMR
he is not in discord and i cant @ him
have you actually taken a look at the bot commands?
that one was easy to find
i didnt find but i will look again docs
probably i missed
/resetstats
i can‚Äôt remember if it works if the player left the server
but /resetstats player
How to make the queue clear players out of it after 60 minutes of inactivity? üôÇ
/timer queuereset seconds:
will reset the entire queue after that many seconds of nobody joining/leaving
/timer afk toggle:
will remove afk players after the given duration
thanks
no its not working
i‚Äôll have to modify the command
well if a person isn‚Äôt in your server you need to paste in their id
<@idhere> is how you mention an id
i need help fast
discord has a limit of 25 buttons for a message, so for games with more than 25 people, you need teamselection Balanced
i can expand it to the other modes, captain selection is the one off limits
can i add captain selection to a tourney?
no, a tournament doesn‚Äôt have any team setup
queue?
basically i want to allow players to join the "pot" and the captains to be able to choose them without preexisting teams
so join as one player
yea that‚Äôs how it works in a normal queue
but you can‚Äôt do that with 30 players
only 25?
yea 25 is the current limit
no prob
How do I remove someone from the current queue?
<@145305657237700608>
/player remove
Tyvm
Not sure if I asked this already
But see on this screen
Is there a way to make it just captains and randoms as the choices?
not yet
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/954499196629692486/1052412178134736926
planned soon
ah nice
hello I would like to know how I use the bot is there anyone to teach???
give /setup a try and check out the docs https://docs.neatqueue.com and let me know if you have any questions
more to be able to activate the bot for a specific chat which command would I use???
Because this bot will be very useful for what I'm going to do on an FPS server
/setup lol
Thanks
Hello <@145305657237700608>! Seen your newest update and i was absolutely blown away about the new 1v1 feature thank you so much!
But i have one question as always - if this mode is enabled the queue page still supposed to be write 0/2, 1/2, etc. instead of something else? Also if the MMR matchmaker feature is working for a certain range, this resolves a lot of problems.
Thank you once again!
hey <@145305657237700608> someone acidently deleted our queue in the server not sure how to put it back up
<@145305657237700608> Neatz We have a backup code for the queue (DMLZM) but it doesnt seem to load at all and gives error
Says I need to vote to use /leaderboard
I voted and still doesn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶
Matchmaking
Missing queue
Load broken
Voting
this is possible now <#910981294937210930>
Issues with voting and /load were identified and fixed
How to turn off creating a voice channel and text channel
Even though i clicked no to both options
/voicechannels and /tempchannels
is there a list of all commands?
if you hit / you can see them all, but also check out https://docs.neatqueue.com
hello
so actually i set up everything properly
and in a match somebody was able to queue up again
just by voting tie without the bot concluding the result
is that possible?
yes, people can requeue after submitting their vote
oh thats not too great
so people can dodge other players this way
i would suggest banning those players
its the best possible option, since if we required the match outcome to be selected, people could be blocked from queuing if other players forget to vote for a winner
and if its an option?
also, you can delay the amount of time players must wait before queuing
so if the average match takes 15 minutes, delay the winner vote by 10 mins
oh i see
thank you
no prob!
also do you know that the bot can handle any kind of logic arguments?
example: role required: blue, red, green, white to enter the queue
but when they are pink role, they cannot enter
and i can define this with /rolerequirement add !pink
or some kind of stuff that denies pink
like in programming
NOT, !, or anything that makes the complete opposite with the bot
just add pink as a banned role
`/bannedroles add`
im just asking as an example, if somebody want to make an exception in the setup in anything other
no thats not possible since the commands only accept Roles as arguments
but the combination of commands make it possible
unreal changed it in my server there, nice
feedback on predictions: when prediction opens and the bot pings everyone who needed, the ping always remains in the channel, and after some time the channel gets flooded with pings - also i cant remove this option once i set up
that‚Äôs a good catch
you can toggle the ping with /predictions role
and toggle predictions with /predictions toggle
hey guys, im having trouble getting the queue to pop up allowing user to join
and the quicksetup doesnt seem to do anything üò¶
never mind guys sussed it out, was to do with permissions thank you
another issue now, my security bot kicked the neat q bot and now it wont auto pull to voice channel and cant /cancel in the match text channel, ive gone through all the permissions and everything and not having any luck
check out /lobbychannel for auto pull
as for conflict with another bot, i‚Äôm not familiar with that at all
<@145305657237700608> how can I set up that just admin can vote the result?
you can‚Äôt really since matches are a majority vote, so it shouldn‚Äôt need an admin to resolve the winner
you can change the /requiredvotes to be a high number though
although that changes all the voting requirements
yea but I tried to  force start certain games where this would become a problem
which means I would need to make a channel for  2vs2 3vs3 etc. and cant just use one channel : for example 4vs4 where you can forcestart
because if if I force start in a 8¬¥s the majorty stay at 5, so if I forcestart a 2vs2
cant vote the result üôÇ
5 minimum needed
that would be a bug then
if you have a 8 person queue and forcestart at 4 people, the required votes should be 3
oh so I would like to report this bug
ok i‚Äôll have to check it out
where can i find the link to donate?
<@145305657237700608> is there bracket system in the bot? for tournaments?
yea it creates a bracket and you can view it on the website
if you wanna donate you can do /donate, or use the website and buy premium
Greeeeeetingss!
What's up!
Attempting to follow the Documentation, but struggling to set it up. Anyone has 5-10 minutes assisting me understanding it, for my basic use-case? üôÇ
I'll show a picture of my left sock as a sign of appreciation
sure whats up
Mind hopping in Voice with me rq? üôÇ
sorry not rn, just on my phone
Ahh aight!
My use-case is a group of 20 friends, playing 5v5 League.
Each game has new team-members.
And we'll like to just keep track of winrate and elo.
Following the documentation, I got lost. And struggling to understand how to get it all just "working"
If there's a "Cheat-Sheet" with the commands I'm in need for, please let me know
I got confused as the commands arent divided in use-cases
sounds like you want the default functionality really, /setup will get you most the way
That's what I've done
"Full Team vs Full Team"
you want PUGs
Let me try
Team Vs Team is the same teams every time
PUGs is a pick up game, everyone joins to create teams
We first and second-pick our team
Meaning it's not RNG
It's still the right option?
what do you mean
Im first pick
My IRL second pick
We choose of a rooster of 8 players
"You, go left"
"You, go right"
Till we 5v5
not quite following
We pick the teams.
10 players join the queue
and teams are then selected
Selected, automatically?
no, via one of the /teamselection modes
Balanced, Captains, Random, Players Choose, Unfair
That comes up, after we're 10 in the Queue?
That makes sense
Ngl, It would be nice with a Youtube Channel displaying different use-cases for this
Ay, Appreciate the support
I got confused with making Party, Teams, Captains etc
yea i do plan on making videos, just havent yet lol
Coach me on it, and I'll throw them up for you
I love videoes as a way of explaining
Rather than when people just send you their Swagger spec or something
yeah i had the bot working and upon testing my security bot removed it for creating a channel, when added back when a game is created no players are tagged and you cannot give the bot command such as /cancel, i have tried this is channels it was previously working in and newly created channels to see if it was potentially a cache error due to it being removed whilst in process, when i typed /cancel it says it has encountered an error and says it has been noted
and it does not auto pull if after giving it the commands
Actually not, it just overrides itself. Also prediction points can go below 0 to the users causing bug to even gain back points from matches.
The only way to disable pred. ping is to create a new temporary role, assign the bot to it, then delete the role.
gotcha that‚Äôs an easy fix, similar to other commands that use a role, usually you can just omit the role and it disables
what server name is this?
yea they definitely would be useful, i have it planned just haven‚Äôt done it
Is possible to set a minimum time for vote?
<@145305657237700608> also you said that if I set 2 channels with the same queue name it gonna have the same leaderboard, but can these 2 channels give different amount of mmr when  win or lose?
no, only a max
Amateur CoD League
Bit more info, If i manually go into the temp channels permission's and sync them with the permission's in the category i can vote to cancel, no names are still being tagged and auto pull stills isnt working even when specified to do so and given a voice channel to pull from and to, going to remove the security bot and see what the result is
yea that all sounds very strange
It should be nice to have it, a lot of users from Brazil are voting before the game end xD
so if the match has a duration of 10min I can insert 5 or 7 minutes to start the win vote
to avoid some trolling
you can do that
`/timer winnervotemessage seconds:`
Oh I see, thanks
The party queue need to have a maximum number of players to play?
I'm trying to configure that
The game is 4v4 but teams can have 11 players and substitute them in the middle of the game
you can set a max party size, otherwise the max size of a party in a match is the size of the entire team
But if the team doesn't have the max size of the party they can't join the party-queue
I mean
the game is 4v4, a team have 11 players and the otherone have 8 players
how can I do to they play in 4v4?
If I set it to 11 players the team with 8 players can't join the queue because they have less players than the needed
and if I set it to 8 players the team with 11 players can't join the queue because they have more players than the needed
Does it has a solution?
you cant really do this
Can you insert this in the planned features?
A queue without players limit for the parties
By now what I gonna do to solve this is: The parties will have only one player (the captain), I will ignore the invite command
im not too sure what you are trying to achieve
if you let 11 people be on a team, then just raise the teamsize to 11
Yeah I Know, but the bot doesn't allow teams with less players join.
the situation is:
Team 1 (11/11) x Team 2 (8/11)

These 2 teams gonna play 4v4
The Team 1 have 7 substitutes and the Team 2 have only 4 substitutes
but these 2 teams should be able to play against each other
but it doesn't happen because the bot says that the Queue is for 11 players party
that would be /teamqueue
change it off a teamqueue
sorry, /queuetype
just make it a normal queue
Made it as normal queue
what next?
just make the teamsize big enough for any party
but in this case anyone can join
it needs to be Party Queue
let's suppose in a Soccer Match
Real Madrid x Barcelona
the game will be 11v11
but Real Madrid came only with 6 substitutes and Barcelona came with 9 substitute
so it's 17v20
you got what I'm trying to say? lol
it's hard for me to explain when my native language isn't the english
I'm trying my best, sorry
i see what you mean, its just a weird use case
I'm trying to use party as team
so I want everyone from my team in my party
but they don't gonna to play everyone at once
you think that it can be made in a feature update?
idk it just seems strange
parties are meant to allow people to play together
team queues are so you must queue the entire party as a team
it‚Äôs not as simple as just letting a party join a team queue with more players
i guess the idea is with teamqueue don‚Äôt put a limit on a team size
Fast qustion
When we do a 5v5 game. 
5 players, 2 teams.

It makes 2 voice chanels, with 5/5 max limit for each team.
Is it possible to have the 5/*, unlimited?
So other members dont get kicked, when they wish to spectate our games
yea you can add a spectator role (or staff role), both remove the voice channel limit
Got an example of a command?
`/spectatorrole`
<@145305657237700608>  following up on <@209846137602048001>  question here. 

Added spectator role, but the spectators are automatically muted and spectators cannot unmute themselves. 

Tried to look up on the documentation but can't find any command for letting Spectators talk freely. And ideas?
no currently you cannot customize the default permissions for Spectators, spectators cannot speak in voice channels
Is there a command to assign a VC as the Waiting Room for the queue?
I tried to buy premium but it didnt work, just can support via the donate, what I did and it was sent in aswell as anonymous üò¶
Nvm found the problem
Report a bug
tells me that the application did not respond
fixed it by creating a new channel and deleting it
I am still having issues with the waiting room channelü´† this should be connected to a role in the server no?
what do you mean connected to a role?
I thought I could create a role where it pulls you in to the VC
nah it‚Äôs not tied to a role
it would just pull everyone that‚Äôs in the match
If I have a 1vs1 queue how can I set the bot so that it goes directly to map selection instead of choosing captain or random ?
/teamselection
and choose Balanced
okay thanks
lovely
I am going through everything and trying to wrap my head around your amazing bot
If I creat a Queue just for teams where users have to create a team and invite players to join it , is there a way to portray with a command the registered teams?
like /view teams and it would pop all the teams in a list?
well you can do /party list but it only lists your parties
you are saying a way to see all parties?
I think that could be nice feature, so that people can see what other teams are in the "League"
makes sense, do you guys use team queue pretty much exclusively?
yea I am trying to make scrims with other teams
so they have a captain who creates the team and then invites the others
hello what is the command to restart the leaderboard?
i did /resetstats all
but im not sure if this is the command
yup that‚Äôs it
how do u setup the bot so it uses server mmr instead of global mmr
just don‚Äôt use a global queue
so /startqueue or /setup
What does it mean by this?
placements: (Required) If there exists a multiplier for the first 10 matches for placements.
I also keep getting errors whenever I try to setup autoroles for scores.
players gain/lose more mmr for their first 10 matches
what are you trying and what do you see?
Hey!
I'm trying to see current MMR multiplier, (The value, it's currently set to)
And commands for that?
you can‚Äôt customize the multipliers, only can turn them on/off
hey whenever everyone joins the queue voice channel the voting process for snake/captins etc never shows up in the text channel
what happens, just nothing?
yea just nothing just has the prompt to join the queue voice channel witch we are already in
so everyone joined the voice channel
what‚Äôs ur server name also
SG SCRIMS
oh did you load a config recently?
yea its been like this a few days i tried agian this morning and same thing happened
do /teamselection again
i updated some data for all queues but forgot that configs didn‚Äôt get updated, so old configs break when loaded
i need to go back and fix it
How do u make temporary vc and text chat private so others cant join or see it?
And can only be seen by the queue
that would be the default behavior
maybe you added a /spectatorrole or /staffrole
We set the starting mmr to 50 after 1 match everyone at either 0 mmr or 3k mmr but the loss and gain was correct (6.6+/-)  doubt it was global queue
/save the config and post it here
KFDSD
looks fine, maybe you didn‚Äôt resetstats?
if i use /endqueue how do i start it again?
/startqueue, /load, or /setup can all start queues
but the same queue?
that was running before?
no, since you ended that queue you can‚Äôt restart it
unless you saved a config
you shouldn‚Äôt end a queue unless you never want to queue again
perfect thanks
and how do we cancel a match?
players can call a vote with /cancel, or staff can use the /staffchannel or /outcome cancel
i see the bug, i assume you have /leaderboardconfig edits Creator
if you change off of that it will work for now
alright
some channels not getting deleted after match ends
on pc ^
was the match cancelled or something?
that Queue voice channel only exists until teams are made
nah they werent
i dont think
the text channels would show the status of the match
i shouldve checked i deleted them
<@145305657237700608> in ffa, is it still set to give everyone - the same elo except for #1?
yes, since currently there is only a single winner
Hey, so I'm trying to run a tournament in my server, I have a few other queues that I run in there and I've unified their leaderboards using the /queuename or /rename (the documentation for those 2 commands are misleading, I accidentally deleted everyones stats like 3 times lol). Anyways, when I try to do the same method for the Tournament queue it's picking up what looks like everyone's stats in the main leaderboard from a long time ago or something. Is this a feature that doesn't work yet or am I doing something wrong?
also /rename and /queuename do the same thing? I thought one of the commands was supposed to just rename it but keep stats?
The stats come from the queue name, so if the tournament is named something an old queue was named, the stats will appear
/queuename just changes the name which in turn gives different stats, /rename changes the name and keeps stats
Oh ok I think I‚Äôm just confused cause I didn‚Äôt realize you‚Äôre using the queue name as an index in your db (or I‚Äôm assuming I know nothing of the architecture of the bot) thanks for the response, I checked server stats and i realized that it was just a bug because for some reason there was a date prefixed to the queue name in the queue list and that was the actual name, /info was showing me the name I thought it was the whole time. Just a heads up
Yo one of the players in my discord for some reason cant see the temp VOICE rooms the bot opens he can join the queue its moving him to team rooms but only after one of the staff moves him in the qeue room do you have any idea how to fix it?
he can see the qeue chat after you have 10 players in qeue but for some weird reason he cant see the actuall qeue room
unless they have some weird permissions issue i would imagine update/restart the client
yea the queue name is where the stats are stored, it‚Äôs a bit weirder if you use Monthly stats enabled cuz behind the scenes the queue name is just prefixed with the month and year
wdym client like tell them to restart the discord?
is there a way to ban maps with the discord bot?
yup /map bans
its not popping up for me, we chose the teams then want to ban maps but nothing pops up is there a certain commands to start map bans?
no as long as you added maps it should appear
for me it dosent pop up
you have maps added?
more than 1?
Hi! Is there a way to set a "soft threshold" for rank-ups/downs (similar to Rocket League)? Say that I have a Rank A and a Rank B whose threshold is at 2000 MMR, if a user goes over 2000 they automatically get Rank A, but I'd like them not to lose their rank unless they go below 1950, so as to not make them lose their rank if they lose their first game in Rank A (does that make sense?)
unfortunately not, currently autoroles only behaves with the strict cutoff
would be interested in adding that though
figured as much. I thought of having multiple Qs for each rank (and thus different role thresholds), but I don't see a way to "move" the MMR to your new rank Q when you rank up/down
well it would certainly be a cool feature to have imo, always thought that addition by RL was pretty cool üòÑ
great stuff with the bot anyways!
I'll add a feature request ^^
What does the lower rating and upper rating function do?
Lower rating meaning if the player passes this threshold they lose the rank? and upper meaning the cap of the rank before the next one?
yup exactly
someone will have the role(rank) when their mmr is between the values
What is the command that rerolls randomized teams?
And does it also work for captain selection?
there is /reshuffle which allows players to reshuffle random teams, but you can‚Äôt reroll anything else
hey i made a role and made him spectator role but for somereason everytime they join the channel they get automuted is there a way to fix it?
and if someone gets captain and he doesnt want to be captain i know there is the command /party captain then you put name and then you put party
what is the party means
not really, spectators are muted so they don‚Äôt interfere with the match
you can‚Äôt actually give up your captain spot in captainselection
/party captain just lets you specify who is the leader for the party
it says to give someone else the captain if u are the captain
there is no way to switch captains if u get choosen to be cpatain thats kinda weird
that‚Äôs in the context of a party, parties let you team up with players before entering the queue
idk i think giving up captain if you dont like it should be a command so there is no way to switch captains?
correct there is no command for that
In too 2 mmr captains is it possible to switch highest captain always being second
iirc that‚Äôs how it should be
Hey having a issue where Im trying to sub someone in, however it says Team Creation must be finished.
Even though teams have been created and finished
https://gyazo.com/48a0fa69e72962be5a0a739c7ce630fc
try specifying the queue number?
did that too
same message
well the winner vote message isn‚Äôt there
so that‚Äôs weird
Ye that was the problem
fixed it
Works fine now
I want to switch it the other way
is there a way to plot the skill distribution of a number of players (with skill distributed normally) after a certain number of games? (say 1000)
because I'm changing the bot parameters but I have no clue how they affect the rating distribution
(are you using trueskill under the hood?)
no not really, best advice would be to use the calculator (which may or may not be in the docs)
also no, not using true skill at all
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ue5labtkpv
may I ask what then? fairly curious üòÑ (but if it's proprietary dw obviously!)
ohhh thanks! I've looked for it in the docs but couldn't find it :S
that is the customizable part of the equation
there is more that goes on under to hood to incorporate your mmr relative to your team, streaks, and placement matches
wait, what does this calculator exactly tell me? not sure I get it
the amount of MMR that changes for a given match?
yea for a single player
‚Äúaverage‚Äù
the variance is the important factor
oh mmm ok I was more interested in a distribution over multiple players and games
cos I'd like to set some approximate ranks for my target population before asking ppl to join a server and start playing to see how the distribution converges
i get what you mean, yea currently there isn‚Äôt anything to show that
alright fair enough, thanks anyway üôÇ
i could simulate it, not home unfortunately and won‚Äôt be for a few days
I think it would be cool to have a tool to simulate the distribution (it should be fairly easy with hosting on huggingface spaces or something like that)
meh could even add it to the website
Hi there! is it possibly show the leaderboard by the teams? Like when you setup a queue only for teams vs teams (5v5)
hi! unfortunately no, there is no team wide stats currently
Hi, in the election map, can I put the name and options that I want?
i‚Äôm a bit confused, what do you mean?
I want to use the bot for a league, the game is Critical ops.  I wanted to know if I can put the names of the maps in each of the options when banning maps
yea you can add maps /map add and they will be banable
Oh thx
Can you help me set up a ranking system for cod
have you checked out /autoroles?
I don‚Äôt see auto roles
you should see the command
Nope can you tag it
what do you mean tag it
What‚Äôs the best way to keep new people from joining que until someone manually sets their mmr
I set a role that new server members get automatically when they join to have a starting mmr of zero then set mmr requirement to 10 but they still always start out with default 750
Is there a command to change default mmr
you can use /requireregister Manual
which requires staff to set the mmr before queuing
starting mmr can be changed with /startingmmr
Perfect thank you!
If you turn off voting for winner  how do you score and how does the channel delete if it doesn't know that the game has concluded
there is no score for the match if you disable voting for winner, that setting is meant if you don‚Äôt want to record any stats for winning
the channel will get deleted after all the voice channels are emptied, or after the match cleanup timer
Alright.
Any way how to make 2 queues in 1 channel?
no, channels are limited to 1 queue
Can you set the win amount of a certain role?
Is there a daily limit for started queues in free version of bot?
Cuz im not sure bout this and i wanna ask
50 Limit for daily.
50 for each queue or for server?
Server, is not enough for B3D. With 1v1 & 5v5 & 3v3
Yeah.. and that's the problem
U need to buy plans
you mean mmr change per role?
if so, no you can‚Äôt, that could be added though
<@145305657237700608> How I can change this one for example to Red/ Blue?
you can change team names with /teamnames
Well, thanks.
how does one join the que
how do u join the queue
<@145305657237700608>
<#915810764277817354>
like that
can u join a vc and help me
i have a big ten man server im trying to run and its like bugging out
i have this but its not giving me the queue thing
do /clearqueue?
also make sure the bot has perms in the channel?
it has owner perms
and we did clear queue it didnt work
ok 1 sec
im gonna update the bot real quick first
fixed?
thank you
i didnt do anything, what did you do lmao
https://tenor.com/view/mr-bean-wink-trust-me-%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%81%E0%A4%96-gif-10540459
i deleted the channel and made a new one
it just bugged out i suppose
strange
Hello <@145305657237700608>! Thank you for helping alot of people with implementing suggestions and providing a ton of support! If you dont mind i have a question. How did you made this tracking on the left side? Or is it restriced to this server?
thats just something I manually added to the bot, its currently hard coded for this server
i know there are bots that do the same thing for any server and show how many members and stuff, are you thinking you would want to show your own stats of like games and stuff?
yes, something like that
i dont want to do it yet, im was just curious
gotcha, its super easy in any case if you were looking to create it yourself
is there any bot that has map bans?
/map bans
are u able to see what maps and modes youve added with /map add
yea, its /info, i think page 4?
/ test and /info both give me The application did not respond
bot is acting a bit buggy after bot went offline
works good for me
we had a q pop and then i think it just went offline again so it wouldnt pick captains
yea makes sense if it was about half an hour ago, thinks seem to be running fine now though
I have a problem. I setted to create the teams randomly but when the queue is full the bot asks if teams are valid, and i dont want that. How can i disable ir?
It didn't appear before, but I accidentally deleted the queue and now it appears and I don't know how to remove it
you can do `/reshuffle` to disable it
Thank you very much, I was already going crazy hahaha
no prob!
On which hour daily games are reseted?
How does it know who won
<@145305657237700608>
If I have two queues in one server, how does rating displayed in name work?
& if I raise mmr change variance
Does that only impact the individual player‚Äôs mmr change or the whole team?
same time stats are displayed in <#935731235790139422> , noon EST
There is a winners vote after teams are created
it will show the rating from the latest queue, unless you specify the queue names you want in the nickname, using /ratinginnname queuenames
MMR change calculations are per player
Its 5 past 18, and i can't still create queue
let me check
Nvm, i had to restart queue
what
oh this is actually a thing?
yes the free tier gets 50 max games a day, which resets at noon est
Are you planing to increase max games per day in future?
For free tier ofc
Not sure, i feel like 5$ isn‚Äôt too much to ask for 50 matches a day/1500 matches a month though
at least for those who live in countries like the US, i understand the issue with other countries like turkey though
but i don‚Äôt have a good solution to that yet
so if i pay 5$ a month its still restricted?
it will increase to the basic tier
to 250 per day
what is the highest achiveable?
unlimited everything
that sounds good, how much it would cost per month?
highest tier is 30
reasonable price for a normal system, i take the consideration thank you
imo 30 a month is a bargain if you are entertaining a community of thousands lmao
hi! is it possible to use the number of people in the Q to update the channel name when the Q is not empty? like `#queue-n-of-6` when n > 0
so something like `/channel name queuenotempty #queue-$N-of-6`
no not really, discord limits channel name updates to 2 per 10 minutes, so it‚Äôs kinda too slow to be useful
oh I see, thanks anyways üòÑ
Regarding the lower_lose_rating feature, I have a question: if I have Rank A at 1400-1499 and lose at 1350, and Rank B at 1300-1399 with lose at 1250, and a player lands between 1350 and 1400, they're gonna have both roles. Is this intended?
hmmm yea i guess that makes sense, no that probably shouldnt work like that
alright, I'll wait for an update then, ty!
not too sure how to approach that fix, since autoroles usually dont need to look at the other autoroles
yeah, without looking at other autoroles I guess it's not possible. 
I'd have approached it with a simple condition "assign it only if no other autorole [in the lower-lower_lose bound] is currently assigned", but ye, you need to access other autoroles with their info (for the more detailed condition) or at least the list of roles handled by autoroles (which is easier I guess, just a set instead of a map/dict)
the only allow 1 at a time is the easier solution imo
probably just default that to True anyways
what are you referring to here?
all autoroles should behave this way by default
at least /autoroles mmr
oh, yup, makes sense
so in your example, even if someone is in the lower_lose_threshold for Rank A, which is also within the threshold for Rank B, they dont gain Rank B since Rank A requires only 1 mmr autoroles allowed
yup, that seems to cover it
you'll still need to have a list of saved roles, but I guess there's no way around that ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
yea thats available at least, i just didnt like the idea of checking conditions of other autoroles and stuff since maybe people want to have 2 autoroles at the same time
at least now it would be explicit
yup, makes perfect sense
thanks again!
is there a command to see a summary of the options / config of a Q?
easier fix: at demotion players stuck at the rank's minimum mmr (no lose points) but after losing another x number of matches on that minimum, set mmr to soft threshold points
so they never have 2 ranks, just a protection from losing and demoting
which can be worn out
also attaching a role to the protection can indicate the players that they are in danger
(when they are in the minimum)
i'm trying to do a 1v1 queue with map bans and picks, but after the bans i wanted each player to vote for a map alone,  but instead they are voting together. is there a way that i can do that?
i wanted the same along with the queue menu and leaderboards menu to be individual and not being a public post - unfortunately, its not implemented and probably takes some time and energy if  NeatZ able do that
/info
nah thats not as easy, but i also think players MMR should still work the same regardless of the autoroles setup
unfortunately map votes are everyone at once. Why would you want them to vote seperately?
You can do team specific votes with /votingmenu, but that wouldn't allow bans
private leaderboard command option is easy to add, what was the queue menu thing?
because i wanted to do how usually works, each team banning and picking maps one at a time
gotcha, the current map ban system does all the bans first, then the map pick
yeah i know, but would be nice if was possible to do the maps picks one at a time
or able set up map bans before queueing up
so the system can filter out matches before pairing
i didnt seen it action yet, but i hope so
the indicator that the matchmaking has (0/2, 1/2, etc.) discourages players to actually try to join the queue, if there is no one to play with, then usually no one is get it the queue just alone - queue menu should be private, so everyone would just see its own version and not indicate queue number status at public/to the players just a message that they are in or out - its a huge setback of getting games
also if need help scripting that type of system, i can do the work without problem
gotcha, i can remove the queue size indicator, the only thing I can do with the private message to show if you are in the queue or not is one of those personal messages that you can click to delete
still happening starting mmr isnt at what i set
check your /info
page 3
starting mmr is set to 100 for specific role which is correct but it still persist
did you reset the stats?
starting mmr is only for when a player first queues
another problem player cant register their r6 account for the bot, says its not formanted correctly but reviewing it is the correct user
is it everyone or just 1 person
1 person
the bot uses this API for R6: https://r6stats.com/api/player-search/account_here/pc
current username didnt work but we used a past username and it seems to work alright
the API probably just didnt get the newer username yet, who knows really
is there a way you can change the api the bot runs off
I can yes, but as a user no there isn't any command to modify that
are you planning on swapping the api it runs off to one thats more updated
I wasn't but I can, I dont follow the R6 scene at all so let me know if there is something better
yes there is, https://r6.tracker.network
the other one is about a year or so old
and doesnt have current players usernames
that why I couldnt register
not seeing the r6 API there
you have a link?
ok I'm unsure where I find it
looks like they only have Apex, CSGO, Division 2, and Splitgate APIs
the r6stats website looks like its updating stats still though?
this is my account look at the level and the season it shows
hmm it says updated 1 year ago
this is the other one
https://r6stats.com/stats/4eea270f-d657-43d2-b652-135ac81677d1/
this person was updated 4 hours ago
thats odd
yea thats weird
im not familiar with the site at all, just saw they had an open api
yea thats fair I will look for an up to date one
can I dm you some stuff so I'm not cluttering support
of course
Net bot seems to be changing nicknames, adding currency next to their names any way to prevent that?]
Net bot?
so this
you have /ratinginnames?
thx it has been fixed
map selection how does that work, does it work when qu is active/team is already selected?
after teams are picked it will goto a map selection vote
thx :))))))))))))))))
What do you think the queue message should show for Matchmaking?
Anyone know how I can set up private match dms for Rocket league? such as having NQ dm the users in the queue once the queue is full with info such as private match username and password?
yup you can do it with https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobbydetails-set
and https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobbydetails-location
Thanks!
Hello! Im kinda noob in setting up discord bots, can someone help me?
This is my current settings for queue
What i need:
1)No players pick,captains are the highest mmr players,teams balanced by mmr
2)Map veto for bo1
3)When match is created, i need bot to create temp voice channels for teams
4) All players start with 1000mmr, +30 for win, -30 for loss, for winstreak need to add additional +15mmr
1) If you want teams to just be balanced by MMR, change the `/teamselection`
2) You can enable map bans with `/map bans`
3) This is already enabled, `/voicechannels`
4) Your starting MMR and MMR changes are already set, but you cant change the winstreak multiplier
if i enable map bans, team captains will do veto?
all players can vote
ok, if i enable that captains pick teams, they will pick teams first, then ban maps?
yes exactly
Got it, thanks
and if all players vote, i set up 3 bans per team and they will ban till one map left, right?
in general lobby, without captains pick
if you set 3 bans per team, and have 7 maps, then yes it will auto select the last map
Thanks a lot for help!
Also, what a multiplier for a streak?
How many wins needed and how many mmr it will give
`0.04 * (streak - 1) + 1` is what the bot currently uses
so its a streak of 2
but its a pretty minor multiplier
Is there any way to make that captains only vote for match result?
not in a normal match, but thats how it works in /queuetype Full Team vs Full Teams
I noticed a bug, when players ban map with captains pick enabled, it only shows that captain voted
but other players voted as well
thats weird, voting menus have no connection to captains
as you can see on screenshot, total 3 votes were given for map ban, but it shows that only captain has voted
i think only the captains should vote for the maps, would be cool to have an option to this
Is it possible to make bot send dm to every player that lobby is created?
i can add this to a `/map voting`, as well as `/votingmenus`
captains only when applicable, everyone else when not captain selection
it would be very helpful
k this is done, will release soon enough
.suggest Option to restrict voting to Captains for map voting and custom voting menus
not currently
it will ping all the players though
oh... you are quick
Players often mute server, so they don't see pings üò¶
Dm would be super cool
is there a way to add automatic created voice chats by the bot to another already created category?, example: Queue setup is in X category, but i dont want the voice chats to be created on this X category, I want them in Y category that is already created with other permissions
I do think DMins players with their respective lobbies is better than just pinging the main setup channel (I thought it was an option at first but dont know what DM option was at the end)
not currently, `/channel category` exists, but it doesn't let you specify a different category, that could be added though
the DM thing you are thinking about is probably respective to lobby details, like giving the lobby password etc
Yeah when i activated it was thinking it was going to DM who their teammates were
for this would be nice to add /channel category: ID + channel copy: ID (So they copy permissions from an already setup channel?)
shouldnt need to mess with any permissions stuff for the created channels
If leaderboard is only editable by me, can players refresh it so they see actual standings?
nope, all the leaderboard controls are locked to you
But I would like to mess with permissions <a:saddies:1036160477039951923>
give me an example lol
But if they click on the link, they will see actual standings on site?
Yea the website is always up to date and updates live
Thanks!
Maybe there is the way to make leaderboard auto refresh every hour?
yea ive thought about it, not too sure I want to be keeping track of all the leaderboard messages
but it wouldnt be too bad
Or maybe there is the way just to lock leaderboard
So players can refresh it, but can't change anything more
lets say I have a category created with the Default channel that I want the new ones to be created like, example: this Default channel has permissions for Spectating role + Coach role, people with spectating role can watch but not talk, coach role can watch and talk, is not necessary for this users to join the Queue in order to participate in the voice channel (sometimes teams would have a coach, some other teams would prefer to not have one) and you can do whatever other roles people might need if you can clone permissions
have you checked out `/spectatorrole` ?
I guess option to remove different filters from leaderboard would be useful
So i can leave mmr only and let players refresh it
ye, maybe there can be like a few of those? like /spectatorrole /spectator2role /spectator3role or something like that to give specific permissions to different user tiers
yea I can change it to allow more roles, also I want to add an option  to enable/disable speaking
<:TaCheck:890102635452067871>
NeatQueue is currently in maintenance mode, this should be resolved shortly. any ETA?
its been unlocked
tthx
Can players vote for themselves in captain selection?
for players that have played matches in different servers, then play matches in a new server with the same bot, how do u stop old players mmr from transfering over to the new server?
stats are not shared between servers unless you use global queues
neat queue says its not part of global queue
does anyone know how to disable these options?
you are good then
/teamselection
Weirdly we get these mmr  (we opened q yesterday)  circled in red
and how about these buttons how can i change them?
perhaps you had different settings loaded when they queued for the first time, so they got a different starting mmr
team names?
yeah
/teamnames
and the colour if possible
color no
oh kk
Settings were set three weeks ago
Hello, hope u all are going great! I've been trying to create a party but this message pops out
what did you name the party?
I want to create the party
yes, what was the party name you tried, it broke on the name
its now possible to do the map selections one at a time after the bans?
nah, map selection happens after map bans
yes i meant is it possible for captains to select one at a time
srry my english sucks
yes you can make it only captains voting <#910981294937210930>
It was called Duo
I used /party create Duo
Now I used /party create Arroz con Mango
but after the bans, they are still voting together, i wanna to make them vote separately for 1 map each
oh i see
yea  you cant do that currently, thatll have to be added
you can do it via `/votingmenu` though
but you cant manually recreate the map bans and map selection with it
Any solution?
yes 1 sec
Updating Requirements...
Pulling from git...
fixed
yeah i wanted to do they ban 2 maps each and then select 1 map each
Thank you
Do you know how to fix this glitch where some people are not gaining or losing mmr?
when did that happen?
Of course this is just my personal example for my queue, which is a private message for everyone
and this one when joined
this is very specific, but the simple point is that dont show the users in queue how much they are now
also this is just a feedback but these are completely unnecessary
sorry for the late reply
just added that so people can tell if they are in queue or not
whatever solution I add will be something similar
they could tell if they just seen what is going on from the message
i meant when the player count is removed
of course
this is why "searching.." is there
also another question (sorry), how the decay penalty works?
it ticks once every time the timer runs around a circle?
or triggers daily after the timer runs out?
whenever it detects that a player has not played a match for the specified duration, it will decay them
it doesn't really have a specified time per say, just whenever stats are fetched it processes the decay timer
and decays the required amount
so if your decay is 7 days, but you dont check stats for 10 days, the decay didnt actually happen yet
but the first time your stats are checked, the decay will update your stats
that sucks, sorry
i mean
it makes perfect sense
someone can be top of the ladder
if the stats of them are never checked
leaderboard stats also do this
sorry
ANY time your MMR is fetched
leaderboard command, refresh, website, /stats, /compare, whatever
quite complicated
its actually the simplest way
otherwise you need background jobs to schedule these decays
like perma decays per day after a set amount of afk
bot fetches user stats from database -> computes decayed rating -> returns player stats
yes, but i dont get why this fetch dosent goes on automatically after the timer expires - daily
cuz theres no need to
there is need
thats a huge flaw
plz explain the need
lets just say you have a leaderboard
what is goes manually
because dosent update itself
refresh - i dont know what that means now
anyone stats modified?
if we want to view any stats of any player, it goes through this
okay lets just say someone stats get refreshed, and runs a circle
circle?
a loop then
its a script loop
happens every time the same, has a trigger
so its runs a circle on the database
checking every player
and decays them if it founds that the decay is met
with the time
correct thats what happens
what about if this is not working?
i had last matches 3 days ago
players should been punished for 8 days ago
nothing happened
set up everything correctly
what ur decay set to
i can send config
2 weeks
have 2 weeks elapsed for those players that should have decayed?
yea, no points losen
played 22 days ago
still on same mmr
send config
VUAON
whats an example of someone who hasn't decayed?
user id
its working fine for me
212525922513846272
you meant this discord id right?
says they decayed 9 days ago and are now 1033 MMR
Here is your config loaded but I changed the duration to 5 seconds: https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/505102060119916545/1014259221753245787
you can refresh/let it refresh and watch the MMR decay
but i cant set it to 1 day
even if its 14x less amount
it messes up the whole leaderboard
any time works the same
bot just takes the difference of the current timestamp and the timestamp of the last match, divides by the decay duration, and then re-adds the remaining seconds of the current decay period back to the last match timestamp
possibly in unix, right?
correct just a unix timestamp
then i need a workaround and just decay 14 time more mmr from a player after 2 weeks, so if he gets back to playing after 1 day after that hes still pretty much screwed
thanks for the help though, i appreciated
not understanding, whats wrong with doing a 2 week period?
its a 1 time grab
one time grabs -25 which is really small, 1 match amount, not does anything
right yea makes sense
for 2 weeks it would be a period of wait
then decay it daily
that would make a player come back to play
but that 350 is rough
for straight after 2 weeks
yea thats brutal
idk I was used Overwatch decaying once per week
there is no waiting period if someone just making a vacation for something, it just bashes it weekly?
wow thats pretty serious oh my god
yea the old overwatch decay system was savage
imagine this in a game where you can gain +25 in a hour long game, and lose same in 3 minutes
because lose is lose, win is win lol
and 350 decay after 2 weeks, and possibly thats a multiple week work
of course it can be achieved in days if someone is really on point and fast
but thats extremely rare
my system is like 1000-5000+ MMR, with 22 default gain/lose
thank god i didnt made mmr ceiling, so it can scale later
yea 350 decay is pretty brutal
Can Someone help me I dont know whats going on for my server I've tried ending Queue and Readding the bot and restarting with a /setup
The bot is missing perms in your channel
i see the error
in the created channels for matches
so i assume your category has some sort of override or something
Ahh thank you
how do I reset a leaderboard now that we tested it and got it all figured out
`/resetstats`
perfect
ah i see the bug why you didnt get an error message
epic
able to setup a duo queue type?
yea with /party
It‚Äôs happened a few times today
it just happened again rn
hey bud just a quick note the variance change is still not up in the docs
I already asked about it but went to check again to do some maths
and could not find it
Yo so the elo with the bot is bugging out and or not giving people the elo
what change
Neatz question
I dmd you
this is a really good improvement
the api is somehow restricted in discord that it made into a new window and* you made a button for it?
button for what
edited
this
still confused
Is it possible to share matchmaking MMR between queues?
yup, just name them the same
hmm, that doesn't really work for what I'm trying to do because the different queues would be for different formats in the same game
for context I'm trying to set up a Magic: the Gathering 1v1 matchmaking server
why doesn't it work?
I guess having them in separate channels with different names could work, but I'd like to be able to set separate auto ping roles for each queue
all queues can have different configurations
ah, gotcha
the stats are just stored via the queue name
can you make the IGN carry between queues as well?
IGN is per-queue, so no not really
you would need to set up your own thing using /requireregister Custom API probably
I'll look into that
actually idk how much that would help in this case
but using that lets you do whatever you want with the IGN
Hello. Sorry to bother any developers here. I kinda curious about is there any possible to restrict players join queue with special conditions?

Like, if your mmr below 1000 you can‚Äôt join this queue.
Or higher 1200 mmr you also can‚Äôt join this queue.
If there is a command to setup I would highly appreciated. üôèü•π
you can set a /mmrrequirement or /rolerequirement
i would use roles
make an autorole for 1000-1200 mmr, and add that role as a role requirement
<:FeelsAmazingVoll:816416991111413762>
Tyvm
I will try it later on
Thanks for your answer <@145305657237700608>
is that voll the streamer, ow tank
Sorry I should just use Pepe frog
nice, i‚Äôm an overwatch gamer too
I can see that from your bot
Can setup role
That‚Äôs pretty cool
meh other games use that too
Like league
I know
But I searched on your documents
ohhh true the examples
I found out bot can connect to some games
Including overwatch
yeee
Which is brilliant for me
Even though I‚Äôm currently using neatQ for CSGO Scrim
But I‚Äôm also an addicted overwatch player
So I do really appreciates your works for this bot.
<a:Chatting:912929251425153044>
lol thanks!
<:pepeLove:1017495118535741480>
the formula for the variance in the mmr
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=mmr-change-variance its there now
You are amazing dude, I will probably be getting the unlimited version of the bot as soon as I finish some details with couple of Spanish streamers
thanks !
<@145305657237700608> how can I change this from 4 minutes?
To like 15mins or something
`/lobbychannel timer timer: `
how do i make it so that the bot automatically moves you to the queue voice channel
/lobbychannel
pull all
for some reason, it seems like matchmaking has stopped working in my server
I did reset the stats yesterday after some testing so maybe that's related?
what do you mean its not working?
players can join the queue but they don't get matched into games
are you sure there are enough players matchmaking?
yep, it's set up for 1v1s
I tried it out with this account and an alt and nothing's happening
hmm havent updated anything with how matchmaking works
i can take a look in like 20 mins
are the players within the threshold?
yeah, everyone should have the default MMR since no games have been played
it also doesn't show any players in the queue regardless of how many players are in it
which queue
matchmaking no longer shows players in queue, but you can disable `/anonymousqueue`
even with anonymousqueue disabled, it still shows nobody in queue
what do you mean by which queue?
I just set up a new queue and it works perfectly, I'll just go and reset the others
hmm true
if my queue is like this but no lobby is found is because of MMR difference too high?
i would assume so
although i don‚Äôt even know if i tested matchmaking with roles
<@145305657237700608> So If I want everyone to have custom MMR starting points would be hard to actually find a lobby? or not possible?
i would suggest not making a MatchMaking queue unless you have quite a large number of people queuing
for a 10 person queue, probably at least 30 people
So it should work?
I think that one didnt work because of the spread of MMRs but I will try to change them again manually
I wanted to ask if there was a team captain mode?
if there at 10 people within your mmr range it should work yea
what do you mean? like /teamselection ?
Like you choose your own team from the queue selected of players alr in
like CSGO FPL
cuz they can draft players that alr are in the 10 man queue
yea that exists
by default players can choose a bunch of ways to create teams
but you can change the options with /teamselection
Is there a way to have a bigger MMR range in order to matchmake?
yea /matchmaking range
why does ratinginname make multiple ratings
for example it looks like Ezed - (100) - (100) - (100)
that would be a bug if it kept adding it
the whole rating in name feature needs a complete rewrite anyways to allow prefix or suffix
hello im wondering how to set the mmr limit for a pro queue from 2200 to 2500?
like the max mmr or the mmr requirement?
all of the queues in my server stopped working again, same issue as yesterday, people can join the queue but nobody shows up in queue and nobody gets matched up
nobody should show up in queue for when it‚Äôs matchmaking
huh, well they were before, it seems to be working now regardless, I just tried it out with an alt and it's working
yea i changed it, makes sense matchmaking means you shouldn‚Äôt see how many are in queue
well, now it is showing people in queue lol
but it seems to have stopped working again
can you join queue again
or have someone join
did you hit a permissions error?
no idea what the issue was, but it's working now
I switched the queue type to pugs and back to matchmaking and that seemed to sort it out
Hello! Is there any way to reduce timer to join temporary voice chat?
Yes `/lobbychannel timer timer: `
thanks
Is there a way to update every time someone enters the queue? It just stays like that for a long time even tho when you re-queue you see everything else
you should just /clearqueue
matchmaking no longer show player counts
next update will force update the messages to reflect this
how do i make it so i have a waiting room
/waitingroom
how do u set everyones mmr the same, just did a fresh mmr reset
wwait i think i just answered my own question
if your answer was /resetstats, yes
does anyone know how to disable the team finalizing?
`/reshuffle`
but if its a 1v1, you should just make the teamselection Balanced
is there a way to ban a player from joining a queue?
`/player ban`
thanks
Hey having an issue with the bot not disconnecting the players after we start up a match or even finish a match. Just wondering if you know what I can do to fix it. Thanks
When I try to join queue it gives me the "The game just started, please wait for the current queue to finish creation!" message even after the game is finished and the only way to fix it is to /clearqueue or have one of the players leave the queue first to update it
thats strange, could you /save and paste the config code here? My first guess would be some kind of permissions error is ocurring
Heyya, during the setup I think I accidently set the starting mmr on default, while I want new players to start at 0
People above 1000 mmr get a role @ Legendary, but I cant find the right command to set starting mmr to 0. Only for specific roles
just set the starting MMR for the @ everyone role
thats what the bot uses under the hood in the /setup
Alright thank <@145305657237700608>
And then just resetstats?
And then probably once they play a new game it changes roles
sure or just /set mmr to change them  back
but yes autoroles activates when a player's MMR changes
Yup here you go VIDJG
thanks, im able to get the same issue too, should be an easy fix
Awesome
fixed
So it should be fixed in my server too?
Awesome thanks a lot!
no prob!

i want to use this function
<@145305657237700608>
which one
oh matchmaking
`/queuetype`
ok. choose beta type!
Interesting website you got there
I was wondering what the login button did exactly?
looks like the website‚Äôs backend went down
<@145305657237700608> how do you make an infinite queue?
nvm i guess the ssl cert expired
wdym
like a queue thats lasts forever
so people can join games whenever
itll always be there
that‚Äôs how all queues work with NeatQueue
restarting bot to update cert
<@145305657237700608>
Thinking implementing NeatQ into a server of about 2,500 users would like some tips beforehand lmk thank you  <@145305657237700608>
idk any special tips, maybe just be sure to add a /resultschannel and maybe use /anticheat
use autoroles for engaging people
could you VC
i can explain the special dynamic i have to work with
aight
Is there a way to set a user's MMR based on a role they have?
Without having to do it manually
you can set their /startingmmr
Ah you're a god send bro
and if i turn off MMR change, it won't affect MMR?
I have 3 different tiers, Tier 1 being the highest and tier 3 being the lowest. I'm trying to restrict certain tiers from joining other queues. However, if I set their starting MMR to say 0 for Tier 3 and then they eventually become a Tier 1 player(by achieving a higher rank ingame) will their MMR have to be manually adjusted? OR will their starting MMR be adjusted if their role changes from Tier 3 to Tier 1?
Does that make sense?
startingmmr only is useful the first time someone enters the queue since thats when they get their starting mmr
if all your queues share the same stats system, then their MMR would go up/down normally no matter their rank
Ah... I'm trying to use the bot as a way to avoid MMR completely and restrict queues based on the roles: Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3
is there a way to do that?
yes, you can use /rolerequirement instead
or /mmrrequirement works just fine too
thanks thank
yea either works, but if you arent using NeatQueue's MMR system, i guess the role requirement makes more sense
One last thing. I think.
The options at the end like "captain" "random" "disable mmr" "enable mmr"
those things
can i get rid of those options completely?
i just want the flow to be once 10 people join up, they're divided based on their roles
so it's a valorant queue: 2 teams of 5
I have the roles setup as: Controller, Initatior, Duelist, Sentinel, Fill

So they'll be 0/2 and I want 1 each for the teams. If that makes sense?
/teamselection can let you change the available options
/mmr change set 0, or /mmr change allow_disable will remove those options
and with /roles, each team will always have the exact roles you specified
Perfect. Thank you so much
no prob
Is there a way to see what 3 queues I have setup? I think I might've bugged it out when I made the first one and it's not letting me make my 3rd
Each queue is in a separate channel,  there isnt really a way to see them all
gotcha, i'll just go through and /endqueue in every channel
i guess I can look them up if you need
sry late response. i ended up finding it
thank you sm
What if someone with the same roles and permissions as anyone else can't see the "Join" and "leave" button
Anti cheat set to false
that would just be their discord client having an issue
hello <@145305657237700608> . on few occasions. even when a queue is full and game starts, bot still sends AFK alerts in DM

i think it happens if someone used the "im here" functions.
thanks for letting me know, i‚Äôll check it out
how do i set points for everyone and not just one user?
(points not MMR)
currently there is no way to mass update player stats
oh dang, oh well!
thanks for the answer üôÇ
.suggest Add /set and /add commands to affect all players
Your suggestion has been submitted to the server staff for review!
I've been working on supporting translations so will be a bit
thanks!
Can I get a queue back running after using /endqueue?
no it is gone
has each server one mmr system? or can I add multiple?
you can have unlimited, MMR is stored via the queue name
I can link the queues correct? (joining the MMR)
MMR stats can only be linked via the queue names
is there a way to unlink them or ending the queue is the only way?
if you mean /link, then /unlink
if you mean the MMR link, then just change the /queuename
Im trying to show the MMR for players in their nicknames but it doesnt show for the admins
But shows for all other players
it only works for people that the bot has more permissions for
in Discord you can only nickname people with less perms
So how can I change that
not allow the admins to change nicknames?
you need to move NeatQueue above all other roles
then it should be able to nickname anyone except the server owner
so just drag it above the rest of the roles correct?
Is it possible to have 2 separate MMR queues? I currently have 2 queues with different games and names, but MMR is shared between both of them
if the names are different, the stats will be different
<@145305657237700608> yooooooooooooooooooooo
Is there a way to set queue decay to the top # of players
To prevent lb camping without punishing everyone
not currently, it applies to all players
I would like to make that feature reauest
How do u make it so joining a voice channel is not required to start the game
<@145305657237700608>
`/voicechannels`
<@145305657237700608> how do I make it so when ppl join server they register with a name
And can u make the select like between things say if I was doing a TM server can I make them choose of they are ps or xbox
could u give an example
Like when I go into a different TM server u first have to register like do /register (your name)
And then ppl will have another thing that let's u like pick a box either xbox or Playstation n it will put a logo on ur name
you can do `/requireregister`, but that will only require users to provide a username/account
Okay ty
<@145305657237700608> if I put rainbow 6 as the mode for require register what does that mean
itll attempt to fetch the player's rating, and will use that as their starting MMR
Is there a way to just set the starting mmr for the que when ppl play and everyone's starts as that
And how do u change wins and losses like how much elo per win n losee
Loss
yea /startingmmr
and /mmr change
is there a video tutorial how to set up this bot?
no... i keep meaning to do that
is there any text tutorial?
doing /setup will get you most the way
yeah I tried but a lot of it is confusing
all commands are on https://docs.neatqueue.com
aight
thanks
ill get around to videos eventually
which queue makes people vote for captains?
would it be full team vs full team?
no that would be PUGs
Pick Up Games = Random people queue up and pick teams
ahhh
thank you for the quick response <:P_peepoheart:871479005679853598>
<@145305657237700608> when we que into a game it requires us to join a vc how do I turn that off
And how do I make it so it makes it team captains
/voicechannels and /teamselection
Hey <@145305657237700608>, do all queue options give mmr
yea, all the queue types tie into the mmr system
for the most part, each queue type just says how teams are formed, after that it‚Äôs all the same
gotcha thanks
how do i add a map ban
I need to know how to do map bans as well
And also how do u make it so ppl can't go below 0 points <@145305657237700608>
`/map bans`
you can add a `/mmr floor`
And how do I make it so it doesn't show up that ppl can vote to cancel when they get games
<@145305657237700608>
Can I turn off where when the people wue n get a game where the cancel game n vote for winner auto pop up n ppl spam it to cancel
<@145305657237700608>
Like ppl will que into a game n then the pops for the cancel n winner show when it makes the new channel for the game and they vote n it cancels
Is there a way so they can't vote n make it cancel
you can turn off the cancel command if that‚Äôs what your asking
goto your Servers Integrations tab
and change the command permissions
<@145305657237700608> dms if possible
Where's that <@145305657237700608>
Or can I make it so everyone in the game has to vote to cancel n not just some of them <@145305657237700608>
Cuz I have trolls in the server n they will spam that so ppl can't play
it‚Äôs a majority vote
sure
msged u
hey neat, is there a way to track someone that gets banned in the logs, we have an issue of people getting banned but we dont know who is doing the banning
If they banning through discord its in audit logs in settings
they probably meant queue bans, which aren‚Äôt in audit logs
it would be in the /logs thought
i don‚Äôt think it can be in audit logs
<@145305657237700608> when i type name of queue in channel does nothing
yes i mean banning through the bot which isnt seen in /logs
<@145305657237700608> when doing captain selection does highest rated mean most mmr
yes lol
you have to reply to the bot
i‚Äôll have to check, all commands should be in the logs
hello there - i'm not very familiar with discord bots, i was wondering how would i go about get customization/tweaks on my bot that doesn't yet exist? i'd imagine that it isn't open source so would it be strictly based off making the suggestion here?
yea, NeatQueue isn't open source, but I add tons of suggestions from people
pretty much every feature was suggested
is there a workaround for people voting on the game winner, and queueing up before others?
you can basically do your vote in advance, and have a head start to joining the queue
yea, usually the way to fix this is change `/timer winnervotemessage`
you can delay when the buttons to vote for winner become enabled, so nobody can vote
the reason why you aren't blocked from queuing until the actual winner is selected is cuz sometimes people forget to vote, and it would block all players
oh ok sweet, is it 100% mandatory to have all 10 players vote? is there an option to have maybe 80% vote then it goes through?
no its a majority vote by default
`/requiredvotes`
did you find my bot when I tweeted at you btw?
umm no actually it was suggested to me haha
damn, a lot of the functionality does exist, appreciate that
lmao thats funny, i saw your tweet talking about making a 10mans server
yeah exactly
we used it last night, it worked pretty well tbh
yea there is a ton of features, let me know if you want any help or questions about setup
<@145305657237700608>
In the que channel the actual que to join or leave disappeared
But isn't still says it's running in the channel
How do u fix
It is or isnt saying the queue is running
if the queue is running, `/clearqueue` is kinda like a force refresh
does randomized maps keep in mind previous maps to avoid picking the same map 2x?
Is this when you are doing 1 map per PUG?
7 maps
1 map decided
I meant like is it a best of 3, or best of 1
ok so just 1 map
no, currently the bot doesn't do any check to prevent repeated maps between two different queues
gotcha ty
any idea why my leaderboard shows as this?
the website url works fine, but discord sketched out
do you have a role requirement set
that channel is restricted yes, maybe the bot didn't have perms to type?
nah i meant a `/rolerequirement` (which only shows players with that role on the leaderboard), but you dont have that set
is it just the Games tab?
all tabs don't load on that img
maybe, i need to delete it, and do /leaderboard again?
wth, it started loading now randomly
ohh, all time stats work, jan 2023 doesn't load
Have you played matches since enabling monthly?
if this makes sense, prior to having monthly enabled, the stats weren't being stored using the month
so they arent counted in January
yes, it should've always been on monthly afaik
i don't think we adjusted that since games
gotcha, lemme test myself and see if monthly is just bugged
oh, yea looks like something with showing the monthly leaderboard isnt working
hello! I was wondering how to fix this glitch where it goes 6/6 then resets without starting a queue
if it happens every time its probably a permissions issue
try now
<@145305657237700608> is the bot down?
its not working atm
was updating, its back
it worked. appreciate it
ty üëç
anyone knows why it creatws
10 channels
where no ine is playing
what do you mean no one is playing?
yeah no one is playing
in all these channels
they don‚Äôt load
if the channel doesn't load, that means the channel doesn't exist
Discord mobile is garbage
wtf xD
if you look on PC, you wont see them
Is there a way to use ur leaderboard if there's a diff mmr bot in the discord
you would have to build your own thing
and use my APIs
Ur fine
How do I change the que type to a list
Instead of the 3d buttons
<@145305657237700608>
what do u mean
Like is there a way to change the que from a 3d looking que to like a list
Where u dint have to press join que or the buttons
Like the same way u can change the leaderboard
no, but im not sure why you would want that
Is there a command to check whose in the game that ur in
So u don't have to scroll up to check to submit scores <@145305657237700608>
maybe the winner message should just have the teams on it
<@145305657237700608> how do I make it so everyone starts at 0 mmr
do /startingmmr
I did that n it still makes it 1000
Like I do / starting mmr then it make me pick roles
yea thats right
I picked 0 for all the roles
N the leaderboard still says 1000
Can I inv u to the server n show u what I mean
make sure you overwrite the @ everyone role
There is no @everyone
the startingmmr's start with just that role
I can't click everyone
How would I make it show up
when you do the command just pick that role
I think I got it ty man
So after I do the @everyone n make it 0
The leaderboard still has the ppl that were 100 there
Do we have to refresh it or somen
After we change it to 0
you have to delete their stats or change their mmr
So delete everyone stats?
if you want
or just the people you want
I reset the mmr n stats of everyone
So after this next gsme
Everyone should be at 0
Except the ppl that win
Correct?
yea but it might not affect this game
cuz if you dont have any stats in the system, the bot doesn't know how to add your win
i see the /map ban command
but idk how to set it up
9 maps, ban down to 1
If you added 9 maps already, just
`/map bans bans:4`
both teams ban 4 maps each, last map is selected automatically
okay cool ty
i have the 9 maps added, is there anything else i need to do
nope if you did the map bans command itll do it all
We're having new queues put in people who are already in a match
It doesn't happen 100% of the time, multiqueue is disabled
Has this been observed before? If not, I can try and figure out how to reproduce it if it is a bug
Usually its just cuz people are joining the queue after they vote for the winner, but a winner wasn't picked yet
We've set the winner timer to 20minutes to prevent this a bit, is there a better way we should approach it?
no thats kinda all you can do
unless you have any ideas for ways to prevent it
Not without some kind of game tracking, no. Hard to say when a match would end so yeah lol
All good, thank you
no prob!
Your responses are lighting fast, appreciate it NeatZ. We're using your bot for the Valorant Pro 10 mans
lol, i spend alot of time with Discord open cuz of work and school ü•≤
same, same lol. Discord is chronically open for me as well
some 50k combined viewers are seeing your bot at least though haha, wonder if all those new members yesterday have anything to do with it
Wish I knew that was going on, would have tuned in LOL
but yea 50 new servers didn't seem like some coincidence
Hey NeatZ! I'm a dev working with Kotri and tarik on the Pro 10 mans. Going to probably have a variety of questions, but I was wondering if you'd be willing to allow me to contribute source to the bot/API. 

Would help us implement features we'd like without overloading you, and would help the bot get more features in general.
Hey! I guess it depends on the scope of what features, im usually inclined to say no since I've been able to everything solo so far
you can let me know what you're thinking though
For sure, totally okay if not. Just figured it might help, not sure what features exactly yet. One thing that might be nice is having the ability to get a single user's leaderboard position via API, instead of the entire leaderboard
sure that can be added for sure, currently the two closest API endpoints are `/api/serverstats/{server_id}"` and `/api/playerstats/{server_id}/{player_id}/{queue_name}`
if you are talking about contributing to the website, that is open source, totally happy with that
i dont like managing my website anyways
rn I'm planning on making our own site that along with the application, will have a leaderboard that pulls from your API
(it'll pull via my server -> your API, probably cached on my end)
does the playerstats endpoint provide leaderboard position? Or just win/loss and MMR stats
not currently, the only API that gives that is `/api/channelstats/{server_id}/{channel_id}` which is the same API used by my frontend
Gotcha, makes sense üôÇ
if you need individual stats you can just pull from that  for now
Yoyo, just got the error code `VAGSH`
when trying to pick teammates
the bot died, never seen the error before
`Cannot connect to host discord.com:443 ssl:default [Too many open files]`
Hm, any idea what I should do?
retry the match
looks like all commands are failing, not sure if remaking the match will fix it?
its just getting hard core spammed and trying to catch up give it a sec
kk sounds good
try now
Tried to cancel the queue and it failed
yea that match didnt ever get created
just delete the channel and go again
failing to join queue
> This interaction failed
yeeeeeee
is the bot just overwhelmed maybe?
wonder if its all the viewers with the leaderboard website open cuz it auto refreshes LOL
oh damn
every 10 seconds
idk tho
yeahhhhhh
we can setup a private instance tomorrow if u want
I would 100% throw the leaderboard site behind Cloudflare and put it on a cache
any solution 4 tonight or not really?
o shit did it work or bug
i saw it all just pop
when <@138433740559876096> told his viewers to close leaderboard it fixed LOL
LMAO
I have all the stuff I was doing behind Cloudflare and was going to put it behind a decent cache, if you need help with that hmu
should be really easy to setup
yea probably should do that
API just has a simple ratelimiter
ah yeah
I was so afraid of bombarding your API which is why I was gonna use cloudflare for the cache lol
idk i mean it couldn't have been that many requests
794 people on the website, with auto refresh every 10 seconds, like 80 requests per second
only 794? hm
idk theres a good chance its not website related, that discord error is very strange
I blame Discord
googling around it seems like its my fault somewhere
frequently happens with web servers
too many file descriptors open, maybe with responding to the requests with the scoreboard data
i realized you guys weren't seeing the selected Map in the final teams message, its cuz you have 6 map bans per team specified so it bans all the maps
change it to 4, and itll show the selected map
Hello, how to cancel the game
<@145305657237700608>
Try /outcome cancel
If you're an admin
and how to change it so that there are 2 players and not 4.I click cancel it is not canceled
do /teamsize to change the teamsize if that‚Äôs what you mean
Yoyo NeatZ, anything I can help with to make sure we don't accidentally crash the bot again today when streamers go live? üôÇ
I‚Äôm not sure, i increase some resources and changed the website auto refresh to 60 seconds from 10 seconds, will see if it helps
Sounds good, appreciated!
Really would personally recommend Cloudflare for caching, don't wanna backseat your dev ofc. But it's free and the caching would definitely help. Even just a 1 minute cache
i did set up cloudflare but it was blocking something with my backend, didn‚Äôt have much time to take a look
the caching i need would be between my website and server right? isn‚Äôt cloudflare caching between the user and website
My brain isn't 100% working rn. But what I'd do is:

1. Setup a subdomain like api.neatqueue.com
2. Make sure Cloudflare is proxying requests for that subdomain
3. Add a cache for that domain

In theory once it's proxied all you need to do is add a `cloudflare-cdn-cache-control: maxage=60` header to the API response (or however many seconds you want the cache to persist)
Then when your site makes a request to the API it'll be cached
okay makes sense, i did have the proxy enabled on my APIs subdomain
something was wrong though cuz requests weren‚Äôt making it through but i‚Äôll have some time in a bit to check it out
Where are you hosting it right now, if you don't mind me asking?
oracle cloud
gotcha
ok my apis are behind the proxy now too with the cache enabled
Sorry again, which team should I enter to see the top players
is this good or bad I can't tell from the screenshot lol
just funny, basically all the logs are just from leaderboard lmao
oh lmfao
We've had a couple cases where a queue will be created and someone that already is in a game is in the queue. Might there be some race condition?
I think the ID was 150715 (I could be remembering the number wrong)
Could we add some check when a queue is starting to verify none of the players are already in an open game?
hmmm, joining a queue is an atomic action, perhaps there is a chance you can rejoin queue in the 1-2 seconds where the match channel is created
yeah, honestly if we could sub in/out players for a queue before the game starts it'd help a lot
but yea thats a simple solution, feels like it should just be prevented altogether
this was a limitation that probably can be fixed now
you're the best
actually wasn't too bad, will be updated tomorrow morning
hey, haven't messed with it yet
but can we change the match names/team names based on captain picked?
<@145305657237700608> seems like bot is down again
I think we broke bot lol
damn i hit that same issue again
Too many open files
gonna cry
its back
Is the bot down
Can't score any games
Seeing recovery
<@145305657237700608>
<@399720306316673025> try again
It fixed
sorry neatz :(
no worries lol, its just a bizarre issue
oh sorry
`/channel name team channel_name:Captain`
Error code: RYQYI
what language is the bot written in, out of curiosity?
.. python
If it helps, I'm sure we can probably host/sponsor a private server. We'll talk to tarik about it
at minimum our issues won't effect all of your other users
dope, was just wondering üôÇ
I wrote a Cloudflare worker to cache leaderboard data per channel for 60 seconds so that the requests dont hit my server, i need to configure some stuff which would take the bot down for a bit so gonna do that tomorrow mornign
probably should just stop all the auto refresh shit too
yeah honestly I didn't even know it autorefreshed until you mentioned it
my friend/coworker intro'd me to cloudflare workers and they changed my life lol
planning on hosting our entire application system on it
cuz really the amount of load with queues is nothing, there has been days where the bot processed thousands in a few hours
and the amount of requests isnt crazy
there is just something weird going on where its just keeping all the file descriptors open
we have a match that got canceled but the channel isn't deleting and is messing with the queue a bit, any way to override the cancel or force reset the queue?
it was during the lil lag event
if its a stale channel just delete it
and you can always /clearqueue if needed
rog, okay doke
is the leaderboard not updating?
It should update every 60 seconds now I believe
or just refresh the page lol
hey so this works but the buttons themselves still say team 1 or team 2
https://getrekt.cc/gEvNU6.png
im disabling the auto refresh when I update next until I see if the cloudflare worker saves me
oops ill fix
no worries :)
also I feel bad that I keep asking questions but I appreciate you for responding to all of them. Sorry for the trouble we've caused lol
oh hmm i guess the command really just does the channel name, probably just change that
gotcha, that is what it says in docs so it makes sense
I have one last question for now, the reaction role command, does it only work to use this for spectator roles (i.e. the role selected will be given perms as a spectator) or can we use this as a "react her to get pings for 10 mans"
this bad boy:
dont worry about it, its a good thing to improve my infrastructure lol
https://getrekt.cc/Lx9Ex6.png
you can use it for any reaction role
wonderful
its just like a separate feature
I figured, It looked like you had to set spec roles separate anyway so I was just checking
idk why `/channel name team` is even a thing, should just be part of `/teamnames`
Also happy to provide any knowledge or dev time since we're asking so much üôÇ we're most likely not going to make our own bot now that yours has been so great
infrastructure knowledge is helpful, pretty new to me (as you can tell)
fwiw it's fairly new to me as well lol
but happy to help
Doing a lot more of it (and backend dev) at work as well
yea i work part time as a backend dev + full time student, way too much going on rn LOL
as for the bot going down, i think i just ran out of file descriptors since the default is like 1024
which is insanely low
totally understand, I've got pretty much all day aisde from work to help
tomorrow morning im going to push new updates, as well as finally get the cloudflare proxies + worker working, if it still breaks then who knows
just rewrite it on Go <:zamKappa:910320944386547743>
might as well just go for C
the leaderboard in discord is different from the one on the website
Discord requires you to press refresh manually, the site will be updated automatically
unless you just did that in which case idk
both stats from the website and in discord come from the same exact location so one is just old
We use Go at work, and so I've started using it for all my side projects. It simplifies so much and just works, scalable, out of the box
I chose python cuz I wanted to learn it last year, started as a small project, kinda just kept growing
oh yeah Python is totally fine for this
although havent had any performance issues really
<@145305657237700608> some players are getting "Interaction failed" when trying to press "Rematch"
other things seem to work
that‚Äôs weird, no errors from it
does the rematch work still though
unfortunately not :/
oh...
i see
your results channel isnt the same as your queue channel so it doesn't think a queue is running
ohhhhhhh
ill fix tomorrow morning, not now, im going to bed lmao
good bug find though
kk appreciate your help
I'll just tell them to requeue
have a good night!
<@271014487451107329> btw this is why
<@145305657237700608> beta bot is down
yea i didn‚Äôt know if anyone would use it lol i‚Äôll put it back up
wait no i‚Äôm not, i‚Äôm making it live on the main bot
What's?
hmm let me see what i broke
Is their a way to make the game start wihtout having to clikc start game once everyone is in queue
how long would it normally take to get the credits? <:Yes:1066058193597382726>
its usually immediately but if it wasn't I can check for you
no i didnt get my points
plz dm me your email
is bot down?
the commands aren‚Äôt working
you cannot vote or anything
i was thinking that the bot is down as well
What do you mean you cant vote?
As for command issues, Discord reported they disable the command search due to API issues
I can't use  commands either
oh kk
is there something wrong with discord or the bot?
Depends what you are trying to do
but if its commands not working, its Discord
what could i do?
wait until Discord resolves their issue lol
https://discordstatus.com/
im stuck too
<@145305657237700608> any reason why "/setup" is an invalid command?
see the message above ^, Discord disabled commands
oh okay, so just wait for a fix on discords side
yea unfortunately
Hey I‚Äôm trying to cancel the que in my server do u know why the bot isn‚Äôt popping up ? <@145305657237700608>
^^^^^^^^
Good morning Neat
Am I missing something on how to generate an API token? The link doesn't seem to populate anything for me
Here: https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=api
looks like the wrong hyperlink: https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=webhooks-generatetoken
ah, didn't see that one, thanks!
probably going to have to wait for discord commands to work again
yea, this is super annoying
i want to update the bot but i do that through a command :/
thats why leaderboards are a bit bugged, they rely on a new endpoint
looks like its been down for 4 hours or so now
and ah, I gotcha
guess I should just revert the change for now
commands should be back up
it works for me now
true!
Can you please add Russian to the bot?
I was just going off of the discord status site, they haven't updated it I guess -- but nice!
see <#1066129548036538459> , I can open up translations for Russian
hey Neatz, i've purchased some credits, but it hasn't updated on my dashboard. Does it take some time to go through?
Yes, it would be very cool
usually no, let me check
oops forgot to change something, it just went through
they updated the site 1 minute after you sent that haha
https://getrekt.cc/pMHMyA.png
i'm discord ceo
lmao
<@145305657237700608> how to edit maps for queue for banlist?
the map ban list includes all the maps you added
`/map add`
ya i got it , thanks
And when will you add it?
just added it
There is no Russian language equally
translations don't happen on the fly, they are pre-translated and loaded when the bot runs https://crowdin.com/project/neatqueue
you would need to help translate English -> Russian
I'm ready to help
I open the link, a white screen
uhh idk, loads fine for me
<@145305657237700608> when i tried set up and picked which que type it says interaction has failed?
try again and see
damn wow thanks LOL
sorry lol, I just ran a setup and it worked and I dont see any errors from you
no no like fr thanks
it worked after just redoing the command
oh lol
sometimes with Discord the interaction just drops
weird alright
Is there anyone that can help me setup the bot? I have most things ready to go but I have a few issues im not sure how to solve. I can pay for the setup.
I can answer questions, cant directly join and help rn though
How can I get the MMR to show next to names in the discord?
`/ratinginname`
hey neatz, how would we get our website leaderboard to refresh? it seems like it's super behind in updating
^ the MMR between the leaderboard and the actual bot recorded MMR is different (site says 999 for tarik but his MMR when checking bot is 867 somethin')
hmmm
i assume you tested queues prior to monthly or something?
the leaderboard now reflects overall stats, along with monthly
we had to manually remove* MMR since a game wasn't recorded, then i noticed my MMR on the site was way higher than it's actually supposed to be
we removed those games, so they shouldn't be reflected. i noticed this only happened after we added MMR, and it not being accurate on the site
actually, for my case, we had to remove MMR since I lost
so, the bot has the correct number in the server, but the number on leaderboard is way higher for some reason
yea i see why, you have an MMR of 999 for overall (i assume from testing), and an mmr of 867 for the month
that's weird tho, it was accurate on the leaderboard previously,  then we removed MMR and now it shot me up that high
it could be from testing, but i canceled those games, must be though
yea i changed how the leaderboard fetched
ooooo
what about now
ill change it to prioritize the month
yes now it's accurate
ooo , so it's including some other matches then huh
when it calcs overall stats, it combines all your monthly stats
do i have additional control over the website leaderboard or not really?
the website isnt showing monthly cuz its only month 1, but you had stats outside the month
no, all the data comes from the same place
if in Discord you checked the All Time leaderboard, you wouldve seen 999 for u
is it my choice to display all time or monthly on the site?
no but i will update it to default current month
gotcha, ty
it shouldnt matter right now though
cuz ur alltime stats should match monthly for everyone except for people who tested
btw, i think what happened is that i canceled matches that i tested with myself, but those matches that i canceled didn't get reflected on the website leaderboard MMR
was this today?
no, i canceled these matches yesterday
and my MMR was correct yesterday, then today after you made the change, i think those matches showed back up as +elo (this is what i imagine happened)
i could be wrong tho
Unless you made a different queue for testing, no
did you?
yes, it could've been a different queue
that's likely
gotcha, i assume you created a test queue that wasnt set to monthly
so it gave you the starting mmr
the leaderboard things that is your alltime peak rating
yeah, well, i think i made multiple queues since i was trying to learn how to use the bot
which is what its showing by default
gotcha
do i bother going into that other queue and adjusting my MMR? or it doesn't matter at this point?
better yet, can we just remove the other queue and the MMR completely?
we only need the 1 queue
the important thing about NeatQueue is that MMR stats are stored via the queue name
so if the queues were named the same, the stats are shared
owww
deleting stats in one deletes in all
gotcha
since they are the same name
yep yep, that makes sense
for testing, create a different name
`/queuename`
it wont show up in ur actual leaderboard
how would i see my other queue names?
`/serverstats`
so, 1 of my queues has 77 matches, which is the important one, would i be ok to delete the other 3?
I assume: "1", "Pro Capital", and some random mention?
yea you can delete those stats, but doesnt hurt to just leave them
ending a queue does not delete stats btw
well, only reason, so that my stats are accurate, but honestly, i'd rather not touch it incase i accidentally mess up the important one <:KEKW:906797855145095229>
nobody sees those stats since your main leaderboard only refers to your main stats system: Pro City NA
so yea just leave them lmao
ok gotcha, yeah, only bc we had that problem today, let's leave it tho, it seems good now
ty 4 the help lmao
np! the website change was made so when month 2 occurs, you will see tabs for Jan 2023, Feb 2023, and All Tiime
but sorry to just change things up on you guys üòÑ
its all good, we were just confused. Monthly stats are cool :)
nah, that's ok, it was only a concern bc my MMR was way higher than usual and i didn't want it to seem sketch that I randomly shot up so high
yea people probably thought you cheated offline, unlucky
Hey NeatZ i know you've probably been asked this a lot and i skimmed through to see if there was an answer but didnt see anything
do you ever plan on adding a command for admins to not require a vote for forcestart
NeatZ does /test mode affect the current games going on?
you mean just let any player forcestart the match?
no just anyone with perms to use the commands
as an admin command
no, just the current queue and any created queues going forward
oh an admin version of forcestart
Yeah, currently we're using it for a soccer game but there isnt always 2 gks to hit the required player start
so we use the vote to start with 1 gk when we've been waiting
yea im familiar with that scenario
but yea id be open to adding that somewhere
maybe just skip the vote if the user has enough perms?
Exactly thatd be amazing
lmk if you need any testers at some point
i always need testers, not for something like that though LOL
.suggest Forcestart should skip vote if used by staff
Your suggestion has been submitted to the server staff for review!
We'll we're currently using your bot for every game running pretty much constantly for pugs right now
so theres a good player base to use for any testing
I've seen that, super cool, and thanks!
Oh just to expand on this, no cooldown as well if possible.
yea currently the cooldown isnt dynamic, i have to change that
so it can get added to /timer
Hey Neatz so I have team map bans set 4 is there anyway to remove the map selection part
you probably added the map twice
but yes
do /map selection Random
that didnt put the MMR in the name
if all you did was enable it, then it only happens when players join queue next
NeatZ the dashboard isn't wokring when I login with discord on the website
To use the leaderboard it asks me to vote, I have already voted but it does not allow me to use it
Any help?
oops forgot to update the endpoint the votes use
i can enable it for you
still isn't working
done
wrong person sorry lol
thanks
try now
logged in but still no dashboard
nah you arent logged in
I click authorize
and then
the website refreshes
without the dashboard on the top
hmmm
try ONCE more, just changed something
alright works now
lol, np
hey neatz
so my admin ended que
wiping one games worth
is there a way for admin to change mmr manually
yea you can modify player stats with `/set` or `/add`
We're still getting issues where someone will be put into a new queue lobby when they are already in another game :/
guessing some race condition
have u tried subbing
but otherwise yea that is annoying
yeah I subbed last time and it worked, thank üôè
ngl i have no clue right now how people get into a new lobby while in a game
i changed them
right before a match starts and empties the queue, all players are marked as in game
but there is still nothing on leaderboard and all the states still say 1000
people only show on the leaderboard if they have matches played
makes sense
what about stats tho
`/stats ` should show the updated stats
bet thanks
i think i know why
hold up
i got a patch coming in and i swear it fixes it
are you doing something rn?
did something break
yeah
They're saying that the queue is broken, when it gets to 10 it just resets, but nothing happens
basically it gets to 10 and queue restarts without creating the lobby
ok a game just popped I think
weird
and no errors
very cool
is anyone willing to help me set this up in my server?
same thing happening to me <@145305657237700608>
i fixed it by logging in incognito mode
and try clearing your cache and cookies should fix it
okay ill try thanks
why does my leaderboard and stats keep resetting??
wdym
like
i changed the stats
after the mess up earlier
and then we play a game
it goes correct
and then there is multiple leader boards for one que and then also it reset and says no games are played yet
are you changing the queue name
or enabling monthly
i disabled monthly because it was giving a different score then all time
yea, so before you enabled monthly, stats were being saved in the All Time category
when you enable monthly, stats start being stored in the Jan 2023 category
i never enabled monthly tho
it was auto enabled
so i never messed with it
until i disabled it
monthly leaderboards are disabled by default
uhhh
welp maybe my admin enabled it
is there a way to change players in groups? then
what do you mean groups?
oh like edit multiple stats?
yeah
no sorry
ah alright
all good
in any case, if you want/dont wont monthly stats, you should decide at the start
before you collect a ton of stats
yes just did
turned it off
sounds good, you shouldnt see any "resets" anymore  then
alright thank toy
is there a way to rename a que without resetting the configs i have?
yea /queuename
alright sick
well do you want to keep the stats or no
doesnt matter rn
changing queue name changes the stats system, unless you do `/rename`, which will change the queue name and transfer all stats from the old name to the new
since they already reset
fair
ill just do rename to be safe
Is there a way for us to have stats shown of how many games are currently open/how many people are currently in queue (like you have under stats in the channels)?
Didn't see it in docs but I could have just missed it
unfortunately thats currently specific for this server
all good üôÇ
thatd be cool to make customizable per server though
for sure! definitely would be helpful for folks seeing how many people are in queue, plus nice for us to see how many games we've got going at once
yea could be a command where you specify the queue name as: Current Matches: $, and the bot can fill in the details
neatz
is there a way to merge ques?
merge the stats?
not really no
basiclly
i ended other ques
but the games and stats are still there
for those ques
so in theory if i named them all the same thing
would that work?
or since i ended them its just wtv?
also respect bro for this super impressive
if you name all the queues the same, they will have the same stats
`/serverstats` shows which names have stats
right alright
Small thing, when you sub someone in (/player sub) it doesn't remove them from the queue, it'd be nice if it did üôÇ
also doesn't remove from the channel
remove from what channel
so if you run /player sub person1 person2 the person being subbed out doesn't get removed from the queue lobby channel
ah the text channel
Hey guys, I run the largest eu valorant community called The Goose House. We run the major beacon & vct quaifiers for Riot for the UK amongst multiple other tournaments and events, we have a customs section with an average of 500-800 players per month, we are wondering if theres room to buy a licence or a way to pay to have the bot branded & customised?
I've reached out in the dms
if you can answer .
I am just trying to create a new que for valorant. I put que and que number. But it doesnt creates a new voice channel for me for people to join.
Second do i have to add all maps everytime i create a que?
is there a easy documenation just for valorant. 
I know you guys are busy but just thought will ask
when you create a queue, it runs forever, no need to redo all the commands
if someone is nice enough to give you their Valorant config, you can load it in your server
but if all 10 members joined and then for next 10 will have to start again or will just keep on add 10 continuously
when queue fills, it creates a match, empties queue, and is ready for 10 more people
thanks
Hello there, appreciate the quick support. I have one last question.. I have added the same roles and MMR change for every queue. Stats now count separately per queue, and the stats channel only shows stats for one of the queues. How can I make sure all queues are linked and that stats from all queues are combined?
if you do /serverstats, all your queues should be under the same name
I mean playerstats, wins, losses etc.
This to be a total of stats from all queues
There is no way to see total stats for queues that have the same name
since they are not linked
How do I link them?
By linking roles?
no they need to be named the same
So just change /queuename to the same and it should work?
yea that will make all queues share the stats of the specified queue name
I voted but could not access the leaderboard.
<@145305657237700608>
just tried and it worked
ill just override you
Aight, thanks üëçüèª
hey <@145305657237700608> were you still tracking that issue/new feature for making the buttons on game vote captain name instead of Team 1/Team 2?
I can put a suggestion for tracking if that is the process you want instead
oh sure, i can just do it real quick
try it `/teamnames captains`
kk! i changed it I can test in 1 sec :) appreciate you
yep!
works great
https://getrekt.cc/ioLG7y.png
epic
Is it somehow i can make roles that connects with the mmr from the bot so whenever i pass a specific mmr i get a specific role for the specific mmr?
yup, /autoroles
you can set up thresholds to gain/lose a role
thats the best way to create a server with tiered queues, where you can rank up/down
alr ima try
Whenever the queue starts and i force starts i get multiple choices of how the team will be made and if the mmr will be on is it possible to remove them as alternatives and just have like one choice that you gotta vote for captain and that mmr always is on
yup, `/teamselection`
and `/mmr change allow_disable allow_disable:False`
it worked now i only got  captain selection but when i picked random i get this is it because i am forcestarting solo or why?
probably, trying to pick 2 captains with only 1 player tends to break it
havent had the chance to fix it
so it should work when its 5v5
yea you can try it
`/test`
aight ima try
need help starting 4 players on 2v2 how to solve this ?
do /teamselection
you mustve loaded an old config that isnt supported
how to delete the old config or make anew one
just do /teamselection to fix your current
I am having trouble joining a queue as a party
party queue is enabled
I think is a problem in general
As a party or as solo
Yea both dont work at all
<@145305657237700608>
fixed
cool thanks!
Hello, Is it possible to have the same MMR/Roles shared for different queues?
Like a 2v2 queue and a 3v3 queue but both share the same user's mmr, increasing and decreasing accordingly
How do i change the team selection to be only balanced true or false
and how do i make the lobby information stay in one single channel
like where all the commands go for the ques
yea,
`/teamselection`
`/tempchannels`
Thank you, will try it out!
In the future we might want to hide the names of people that are in queue, is that possible if we do want to do it?
yes, /anonymousqueue
or you can change the queue type to matchmaking
gotcha, thank you : )
also to stop a winner outcome?
Can i turn off party with the bot so whenever i join queue you cant stack with someone else
able to do multi queue, in specific games like val, siege and overwatch also separate register for those games?
yes /voteforresult
yes /partyqueue
plz try and check the docs for these commands lol
multiqueue means you can play multiple matches at once
but yes every queue can have a different config
manage to figure it out
thx for the help though
nice np
hey what's the default setting for mmr ceiling and floor? I don't see anywhere that details its but I'm curious
default is nothing, its not enabled by default
ah okay, thats fine then -- thank you :)
Will it be possible to continue playing at 00:00?
the reset time is actually Noon EST
seems like it didnt reset today though for some reason
Is it impossible to reset now?
ill fix it
Okey
Thank you
Can you tag me when you fix it?
sure
Thank you
try now
Okey, now
I should've asked this before but is there any difference between a normal queue and a global queue ? there is the /globalqueue create command and I am just not sure what it would do
a globalqueue lets you share stats across servers
okay thats kinda sick
so multiple servers contribute to the same leaderboard
gotcha, I don't have a use for it but that is super handy
it was a pain in the ass to set up LOL, but we could make an official Valorant globalqueue name and everyone would be on it
it disables commands like `/set` and other mmr changing commands
replace all of riots mmr system üíÄ
real
wow I can imagine the PIA that was to make, thats super sick though
and its barely used üò¢
only 63 made
it's just hard to come up with a use case for it, a global valorant queue would be cool but you'd have to get people individually setting that up in their own servers and then linking back to a main one. Some kinda incentive for like "top leaderboard" would have to be offered to make people want to use it I imagine
but hm
i agree its a small use case, was mostly thinking to make 2 servers challenge each other or something
maybe for us, we could use it. I set up the bot in the regular tarik discord as well -- have people compete on leaderboard to be above pro's yk
but idk why you wouldnt just combine to another server
yeah, still -- its there for someone to come along and use it
you guys would probably benefit to making a tiered queue system, so people of all ranks and skill ranges can play
we don't plan to merge the discords, the Pro City is essentially FPL of valorant. But yeah, a tiered queue system for the regular tarik discord could be good
we'll see, have to let things play out and see how it all goes first
actually
can we use global queue to link 2 different queue leaderboards?
or is that something that can already be done
same server, 2 queues, 1 leaderboard
that can be done easily by naming the queues the same
you could use globalqueue, but thats basically the same thing but less control
ah okay
we have a lot of EU peeps that play at around this time and some NA folks as well but it helps for them to have similar pings so I'm making a separate queue
makes sense, yea if u want the stats the same leaderboard, name them the same
i just added the bot to my server and im trying to use the setup command but it keeps giving me a "I am missing the Manage Channels permission, which I need to move channels around!" message
you have to give the bot that permission in your discord settings
i already have given the permission to it and it still sends that message
check any role/channel/category overrides
its annoying but something is denying the bot
i just gave it admin and it worked so i'll just leave it at that
thank you guys for the help though
How can all players cancel mmr up to 1000 back?
you cant currently bulk set all players to a certain MMR, but you can set the starting MMR to 1000 and do `/resetstats mmr`
Thank you
is there a way to setup a map voting system to be present for all queues?
no, queues all can have different configs. Important to note that once you create a queue, it runs forever
so if I create a config with all of the different maps in the pool, i would just use /map selection to start that process
no, so you create your queue setup, and then all matches created will follow the settings you set
so you set your maps and map selection in the queue channel, and the match will follow those settings
will the mmr change based upon the mmr of the other players in queue?
by default yes, its dynamically calculated
okay thank you
duke if you want
I can give you the config for valo that we use
with all maps in map pool
you gotta go back and re-add all the maps to include images
oh i misread the question
nvrm
Hello! I got a problem, the names to ping are not showing up üò¶
thats weird, is it always like that?
First time actually
are there any people in the match?
the list of player names is the same message as the Ping button, so it would be strange if one was empty\
We're all in the match
weird, i would just see if it happens again
Anyone know why the bot dosent pull everyone to the lobby after the game?
you probably just didnt set it up, `/lobbychannel`
Oh i did!
did you do `/lobbychannel set`?
yeah
pullall and returnall is enabled too
could you /save your config and post it
Sure
Queue configuration saved as: FPAQS
it worked for me
oh thats weird
it usually pulls everyone to the match but not returning
maybe some weird permissions thing?
if its a different category or something, of if the channel has perm overrides
Yeah, if it happens again I'll report it again so, thank you
It was wierd
All games played, first time happened
Now it's all good<@145305657237700608>
Nvm, it happened again üíÄ
could you /save your config
fyi, i've observed this happening as well sometimes -- usually when there is a minute left to join
oh, i didnt realize the timer
i think when the Ping button enables it deletes the message on accident
Oh I see
yep, thats it
i can fix
damn that mustve been broken forever lmao
I used rename to change queue name and then the MMR's got lost for our leaderboard channel
for the new 10 mans I made
not the pro city ones
how did you do it
rename takes your current stats under the name, and replaces the new name's stats
I did /rename
actually we just finished a match that should've populated the new leaderboard and it still didn't
which server and channel is this
depends whatever name the match started with
Sadge
what team selection mode
tarik server, main one -- not pro city
and then it's na-queue, eu-queue, sea-queue
all 3 of those channels
Yo <@145305657237700608> I turned on /anonymousmode but nothing in our queue changed
do we need to do something for it to hide names?
uhhh supposed to me no
ah I had to join and leave queue to get it to update
yeee
the config looks fine
so next games look like theyll be good
o oke
Is there a way we can see who is in queue as admins?
(when it's in anonymous mode)
yes, there is a queue list uhh
ill find the command in a sec
it's /player list
wait no
no it doesnt exist lol
you could check with the API if you really want rn
ye i was thinking of party list
`/player list` sounds like a good add
or just inf /info
Yeah, and a command for people to check if they're in a queue
because a common question we're getting now is "am I in queue"
very true
and the only way of checking is by trying to join queue again and seeing if it errors lol
matchmaking has a status button
<@271014487451107329> what mode are we in rn? üëÄ
matchmaking i think that's default
right?
PUGS
we're in pugs :)
i knew that :)
:)))
kotri is smartest
no cap
that's neatz
I forget where I find the info about the differences between types
nvm I found it
ah matchmaking goes based on MMR
we probably don't want that rn
any way you can add that for the PUGS system? A status?
yea i think that makes sense, only for anonymous queue though
Yes plz
the leaderboard is workin but looks like the previous stats got wiped :(
https://getrekt.cc/8oI79z.png
no big deal we only had about 3 matches lost or so
yeee, the dangers of /rename
im not gonna update tonight though
yeah nbd
nice üòé
amazing
the sooner the better tho
shahzam didn't realize he was in queue and just got a lobby
while he's in a ranked game
let me see, restarting means the bot needs to wait for all match setups to finish, let me see how many are going
ok it can wait until tomorrow üôÇ
return self.setups()
name 'self' is not defined
return Debug.setups()
queue-155072 (1068366400973963334) in S Tier Minemen (1056129005276889188)
queue-155070 (1068365872479092847) in BAE TMS (1061132816403931196)
queue-155071 (1068366282816237608) in SWEATY 10 MANS (1068203705352065044)
oh not many
fuck it we ball
YOLO
restarting
boom its there
You're a GOAT
its not a problem right now but, is there a way to add cooldowns to rejoining queue if someone misses the check in countdown?
for example, somebody dodges -- don't let them queue for 2 mins
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/954499196629692486/1029877849810800701 yeah should probably do that
words to live by
ah nice, didn't check already submitted feature req's
Had a couple players say they missed the queue, is it possible they were kicked from the queue? Or something?
Not sure fully what the queuereset timer is
queuereset timer empties the queue, so probs not that
are they sure they were in queue, nothing changed regarding removing players
It's possible the anonymous stuff made them think they were and they weren't
<@202170300098543617> <@271014487451107329> adding a url shortener, here is yours: https://neatqueue.com/lb/ProCity
Appreciated!
We're most likely going to put ours on our own site tbh
yea ik, just tired of the long urls i keep seeing
Understandable üôÇ
can anyone help me make a map banning system for Valorant kinda like the one tarik is using in his pro city 10 mans
all you need to do is do `/map add` for all the maps, then specify how many bans with `/map bans`
maybe I should make a channel for people to post their configs
does map voting happen after the votingmenu
is there a way to set a queue so that only a party can join and not individuals?
you like one party vs another?
which voting menu?
yeah kinda like the tournament feature where you join as a team
it goes Team Selection, Map Bans, Gamemode Selection, Map Selection, Custom Menus
also is there a way to connect two queue's mmr leaderboard
sorry for two questions at once
yea change the /queuetype to Full Team vs Full Team
yes, the queue names must match to share a leaderboard
i fix it, but I was wondering how to disable the voting on how to pick teams. Like how do I make it so it goes to picking players right away
`/teamselection`
is there a way for the party feature to automatically create roles?
like "Captain" and then another role with the team name
not too sure i understand
like if someone creates a party and makes themselves a captain can it automatically give them a discord role called Captain
ohh, no, currently there is no connection between roles and parties
sounds good thanks for the fast response
I managed to get teamselection to work, but map bans don't seem to show up
did u add maps
im gonna try adding it again
check ur /info
it worked just had to input the maps again
Is there a way to add an additional voting option where players can vote to select a certain region?
If I'm getting this right - this bot isn't tuned for any game specifically, but rather a "party maker"?
Also, how does mmr work? Is it simply win = + set amount of mmr and loss = - set amount of mrr, maybe with small deviations? are the mmr loss and gain amounts actually based on performance, or just win/loss?
this is hot, ill replace it in places we have it posted
definitely do, we'll post ours
yes, /votingmenu
it‚Äôs designed in a way so you can adjust the settings to work for any game
the mmr calculations are based on your mmr, your teams mmr, the enemy teams mmr, your current streak, and your placement matches
You know comp I can make the message appear in a channel with an image and that when you add the button it will have a role and you can tell me how the /register works
could you break that up into many questions, im lost
First of all, how does /register work?
itll use the account the user provides, and attempt to fetch their rating
Is there any way that when sending the party message when choosing the teams, it gives them a role?
what message is that
the one that sends the bot when doing the /setup
and what do you want to do with it?
my mmr has a decimal point is there anyway to remove that for simplicity sake
where do you see it
MMR for Owen set to 1100.0

after using set MMR
if it won't show up on the leaderboard then it's fine
yea it wont show up anywhere
ok cool thanks
all visual MMRs should be whole numbers
is there a way to preset someone's mmr with a role?
like they have a role so their mmr is set to 1200 before they play any games
yup `/startingmmr`
that when the person joins the queue they can be given a role
is there a way to make winning +20 mmr but a loss is only -15?
yea `/mmr change set` has an optional `loser_mmr` argument
that when the person joins the queue they can be given a role is posible
not currently, it would be in `/autoroles`, but the only options are roles for MMR, roles for top players, and roles for being in a game
not in queue
Can I pause the queue?
so it wont remove inactive players
you can change the timer, but you cant pause it
oh okay
how i do make the bot to move the players into team vc first then start choosing maps?
currently cannot, teams are moved to channels after all voting menus
is it possible to make it so team a bans 3 maps while team b bans 2 and picks the map?
the number of map bans are always even per team
this functionality is already mostly there right, 2 bans and a pick is the same as 3 bans
yah I realzied
perhaps though the team with first map ban shouldnt get first map pick
also does the bot auto track wins or no? if it does is there to make it post a leaderboards of sorts?
with both teams banning 3 maps in a 7 map pool second team essentially picks it
there is a vote system at the end of the match, majority vote picks outcome and then it tracks it on the /leaderboard
very true
forgot at least for Pro City, you guys arent doing map selection, only map bans
ah, yes thats true
we had it for a bit where each team had 2 bans then map was randomly selected
but people liked doing full bans instead
how does the leaderboard command work?
like is there something I have to set up or no?
you just type `/leaderboard`, whatever queue you have set up it will show the leaderboard for
people play matches, and the leaderboard reflects their stats
same with `/stats`
Hello

I opened the map voting to All, however only 4 / 8 players in the queue are actually able to vote?
make sure you disable "Per Team" in `/map voting`
Ah okay, thanks üòÑ
hello is there a way to make it so people can choose a role? like healer tank or dps?
yea `/roles`
you can also use this new feature https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/910981294937210930/1068301047107428452 if you want people to pick queue roles through reactionroles
so let me just understand this, so they can choose a role by typing /role or do i have to setup the roles first? and then with that reaction roles does that have to be applied before or after i start the que?>
are we talking about overwatch? i can give you an example
world of warcraft
i lead a RBG group of 10 people its 1 tank 3 healers and 6 dps
i want to make a que to were when someone leaves the discord for the night or whatever, who ever has that same role will automattically be pulled in
healer leaves, then is replaced by healer
neatqueue probably isnt the right pick then, this bot is meant for team vs team matches inside a server
^ isnt
ohhh
so for custom games
yes exactly
dang
alrighty its a cool bot tho
lol thanks, unlucky
you can do a queue with only 1 team, but it wont pull anyone in or anything
so you define the roles for a team, and people queue up, and get put into a voice channel
no teams or winners, just a single team
Sabes que me podr√≠as explicar en si como crear tal sistema de queue
`/setup`
`/language Espanol`
Spanish is all autotranslated currently, best of luck
you can fix errors here: https://crowdin.com/translate/neatqueue/all/en-es?filter=basic&value=0
is there a way to pick sides like attack and defense for valorant?
you can add it in the lobby details, or add a custom voting menu
i guess lobby details only make sense
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobbydetails-set
how do I do a custom poll?
add a /votingmenu
is there a way to remove people from leaderboard if they left the discord server
is there a way to make it so these pictures get sent to a different channel?
`/resultschannel`
you should be able to reset their stats
you‚Äôll need their id though for /resetstats player
for the setting that puts people back into a channel after a game is done, I think the channel is getting deleted before it pulls everyone so not everyone makes it
https://getrekt.cc/vYH0Gc.png
this one
ye the thing is i don't have it
that kinda makes sense, at some point i changed it so this actions happened asynchronous
A feature for getting someone from the open queue if there's an afk, rather than cancelling the entire match, would be amazing
what about just subbing?
That works, but I was too late to help them with it before the match got cancelled.
If it gets to being cancelled it should just automatically pick someone from queue instead
it should auto requeue all the players that were in the cancelled match
and they go into the front of the queue
oh gotcha, my bad. That's basically the same thing üëç
you've thought of it all!
not really, basically everything is suggestions from other people lol
the combined brains of all neatqueue users
All your dev work has been incredible, thank you so much
Glad to see your donation goal was broken by a lot üôÇ
much thanks, and yea just a bit
Just had a really weird case
where the bot put 3 of the same person in the queue
well
any idea how
I have no idea LOL
tried to sub someone in and it booted him
just ended up cancelling it lol
If I organise a tourney, is there a way to add the queue function where teams who play against each other have to go through map selection process, same thing like they do in the queues?
yea, a tournament starting really just starts a queue behind the scenes, you so you can customize how matches play out like normal
other methods of adding players to queue skips most of the checks, i‚Äôll be sure to make it so that no matter how you join it hits all checks
sorry if this is asked a lot but how do i make another queue that is connected to an existing one so that it shares the same leaderboard stats?
if two queues have the same name, they will share stats
huge, thanks
Hello, may I know if I can merge two leaderboard together if there is 2 sperate queue?
you can, if a Queue has the same name as another, the leaderboards will be shared
<@145305657237700608> ls
And it is possible to somehow make sure that the Nicknames of the players are not displayed in the queue , because weak players see that a strong player is waiting in the queue and do not enter
yes turn on /anonymousqueue
Thank you
The leaderboard seems to be having some trouble on tarik's public discord. The image is correct but the website is wrong, is it possible it's caching a previous score and not updating ?
it should be caching for 30 seconds
Then maybe caching isn't our problem, the image leaderboard is correct but the site is off by nearly 100 points, not across the board but just for some people
ah wait
the leaderboard is right when looking at monthly
but not all time, is there a way to set it to just monthly for the website?
it‚Äôs probably the same issue with stats from before monthly was enabled?
it treats them as alltime stats
potentially, that was on pro city -- this is the other discord but yeah now that you mention it, it probably is
i should change it so that the all time stats only includes stats created since monthly was enabled
it‚Äôs a small fix, i think the current setup is too confusing
idk actually
imagine you played with a certain name for 2 months, then enable monthly stats, you would want those 2 months of stats to be in the all time stats
something is weird with it at the minimum, if set to all time, the stat doesn't move at all. One guy played 3 games and through refresh his stats never changed
yeah that's true
none of the stats changed?
if you compare the leaderboard in discord and website it should be the same
for all time
1 second let me bring up comparisons to give you a better idea
sorry just got back to PC, okay here is nero for example
https://getrekt.cc/5r45qc.png
website MMR
and then match results mmr
https://getrekt.cc/Aux4TA.png
and we have only had the bot this month, so all time stats should be the same right?
That match result is his most recent
if I just disable monthly leaderboard would this fix it? We'd want a running leaderboard anyway probably
for reference, I never specifically enabled monthly leaderboard during this set up at all
You can link to the website
oh, yes but that isn't the issue here
Okay I am understanding more of what you're saying now, monthly got enabled at some point and it screwed up the stats: https://getrekt.cc/JUlhkJ.png
for example, these two should be exactly the same, but because monthly was enabled a bit after stats were recorded, the monthly stats are messed up

I fully disabled monthly stats for leaderboard, this *should* fix it I believe, we'll see. Nero is at 1130 mmr so if it changes then we good lol

EDIT: Honestly I don't know, now website says 14-4 for our top person and leaderboard on discord says 4-0 is our top person, monthly is disabled. I think it is too confusing lol. I'm sorry I broke it on our side.
the issue is this:
the way the bot handles monthly stats is when you do NOT have monthly stats enabled, stats are stored under the queue name, lets say "Valorant"
when you enable monthly stats, the bot no longer stores the stats under "Valorant", but now under "2023-01_Valorant" (bad design)

When you look at the monthly leaderboard, it will show you stats under "2023-01_Valorant". When you view the all time leaderboard, will combine the stats of "2022-12_Valorant", "2022-11_Valorant", "2023-01_Valorant", AND just "Valorant"
so even though its the same month, the stats are stored in 2 separate locations
the name "Valorant" has no association with a month, so it can only be shown in the combined All time stats
how can i choose which channel the winner message gets sent to?
`/resultschannel`
That's what I used but this is showing there too, unless I cant have them go to separate channels?
that‚Äôs the /staffchannel
Okay, thank you.
You can link to the site where the bot is paid for
https://www.neatqueue.com
also i added `/language Russian` if u wanna try
I can't find a donation there
oh the website is for buying premium, if you wanna donate you can do
oops LOL
No, I want to buy premium but I can't find where
oh, login in the top right, goto Dashboard, select your server, and youll see it
I click and it gives me to add a bot to the server
click Login, not Invite
oh youre on the mobile, excuse my bad mobile design
Can I have a video in more detail I don't understand
Thank you
Or is it possible to somehow remove all these buttons, leave only balanced and disable mmr?
`/teamselection`
And is it possible to change the name of these buttons?
if you mean the Russian translation, yes
hi I have 2 queues going on in 2 different categories (10 MANS and ASC+ 10 MANS) 

I can only declare 1 channel for bets. I was wondering if there was a way for me to separate them depending on the category (similar to how you would "link" a channel)
not currently, predictions are serverwide settings
is there way to make it so when in the match room voice chat to make it so that captains are the only ones who can talk?
yes /captains automate
automute*
Weird bug
When the queue bugs and puts someone already in a game, in another lobby. If you sub out the other player it'll remove them from VC
kinda makes sense, it just kicks them out of whatever channel their in, probs should fix that
queues are still bugging though?
yeah :/ just had tarik get put in a lobby when he was in a game already
that‚Äôs frustrating, any idea of how, i assume he was just trying to get a match and clicking the button a few times?
I'm not sure tbh
if it happens again I'll ask
is it possible there's some race condition?
i guess but there shouldn‚Äôt be, each queue press is secured by a lock for the channel, and the join checks happen upon click and upon the lock unlocking
unless there was some other thing that happened to enter the queue, like a match not starting or something
Yeah I'm not sure :/
is there any way we can move people around on teams? someone accidentally picked the wrong person
maybe substitute should allow that
I want spectator to be able to vote for the winner
this isn‚Äôt possible currently, and i also don‚Äôt see a need
shouldn‚Äôt the players be enough?
<@145305657237700608> i only have paypal. can i buy 5 credits?
sure, but i can‚Äôt give you the credits manually for like 12 hours
is there any supporter online üòÑ
what‚Äôs up
hello. i set up the bot in my server. but players names are not showing up
<@145305657237700608>
what do you see
nvm i fix it
and see dms pls
<@145305657237700608> When I try the votingmenu remove it cant seem to find the title and order when i put it says it cant find it is there a certain format I need
i want to remove the first one
it should autocomplete to show the options
I tried that
hey unrelated, I'm messing with custom voting menu's as well. I set it to False for both teams to pick, is there a proper way to offer this voting option to *only* the captain of Team 2?
https://getrekt.cc/vn6Bp2.png
actually partially related, I have the same issue, can't remove the menu üòÖ
added it and attempted to remove in the same channel
hmmm no, currently no way to offer a voting menu to a single team
and weird you can‚Äôt remove them, i‚Äôll have to check it out
you can try typing exactly the title and order
Choose Side 1
i think
i did try that
ok fair, no worries. We just remind them to pick side at the end once in game :)
you can add that in the lobby details
try 0 instead
otherwise i‚Äôll have to check it when i‚Äôm back
I tried 0 it didnt work
strange, they are popping up for me
what‚Äôs your config? /save
KYYQZ
smart! can do
also, fyi mine is also not offering me an option to remove it
is it possible it bugged because I added it in test mode?
or does test mode not actually save when it is disabled
test mode basically just makes it so you can join multiple times, and voting menus require 1 vote
strange, it lets me remove them
if you type exactly like that it should work
but i can also remove whatever and give you the code
ok can you remove the Side Order 1
NLOPE
oops
NLPOE
also when I load it it will overide the previous save right?
ok thank you
i could probably add an option to make it only 1 team votes
and it‚Äôs just whatever team didn‚Äôt get first pick in the last voting menu
yeah that would be it, just team 2, or honestly an option added to custommenus for like, which team sees it would allow this and more customization for other people
yea that‚Äôs true
i always try to keep in mind the fact that you can have any number of teams
but specifying team num is a good alternative
<:PepeCool:710453203082149928>
I agree
Is it possible to change the name of the voice chat queue and text chat so that it is called differently
voice chat queues can be changed to team name
with this command: /teamnames captains toggle:Enabled
alternatively vc's can be named with this command too:
/teamnames set team_names:Team Alpha, Team Bravo, Team Charlie, etc...
change the names to whatever you want
iirc this doesn't apply to the queue text chat since that is named prior to team creation
---
had a queue bug for the first time, what does this error code denote?
https://getrekt.cc/EydFar.png
This is what the player said happened "So we had 7 in there waiting for the game to end then when it ended 3 joined the queue to make it 10 it doesn't make that queue vc and restarts the queue"
when all players join the vc, no menu pops up? Is that an error on my end?
yes, missing permissions
if you look up in the logs, was there any players in the match?
i‚Äôve been chasing this bug for a while, my best guess is the bot starts a match which ends up having 0 people, and the captain selection breaks cuz it can‚Äôt find a captain
who would be missing perms?
NeatQueue
I'm trying to add 10s to a collegiate server so it could be messy
my best guess is the category it is in has some override
the specific issue is the channel it created, something is blocking it from sending messages
cant confirm, made a logs channel but I guess it wasn't recording anything :(
if it happens again I'll know
i‚Äôm fairly certain you would see no players, so hopefully it didn‚Äôt actually break anything?
nope, queue just got cancelled so it fixed itself!
lol, if it affects nobody, does it even exist?
well, I manually cancelled but no players were effected and it let them requeue
the complaint was a few of them missed the new queue because they got put back into channel and some were already waiting
no big deal tho, yeah. Fixed itself :)
weird still
for sure
quick question on /ign -- where does this info actually display?
I have it set but don't see it placing it anywhere
last thing, anyone know how to remove CD on forcestart?
only in the final teams message
figured its useful for adding people or something
unfortunately this cooldown is not dynamic currently so you are unable to change it
it has been improved to reset on command failure though
appreciate you!
ü§ù maybe we will see you in a collegiate OW match
or your school
here?
https://getrekt.cc/vtRj6D.png
oh, you need `/requireign` too
probably a dumb requirement, but its there currently
how do I lock down the permissions to see the VC ? My server is locked behind a members role but anyone that joins can see the generated VCs
that should be your category permissions
its disabled - working for the waiting lobby vc
but the vcs that get generated by the bot* doesnt have those perms
if the category is hidden, then any channels would also be hidden no matter the channel perms i believe
the generated vcs have their own perms
ive looked into them
I have everyone to not view as category default
what perms does it say for everyone
its just default?
by default it shows
dont know how its overwriting the everyone to not view channel in the category
i mean like, the View Channel permission is just defaulted there, so it should just inherit whatever permissions the category has I thought
ill see if i can reproduce it
thank you üôè i triple checked just now and no one has view access except the asc+ 10 man role
im confused lol, so is it working?
no the vc's arent
sorry im talking about the permissions i can change
The queue channels are fine actually - its just the VCs
ok gotcha, ill check it out now though
and ty seriously everyone loves your bot it makes q-ing so much smoother
i think I do see the issue though, the permissions for created channels ignores the category currently, but I can fix it
so it should just copy the category perms and modify them
that would be amazing
if that‚Äôs the issue i‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs gone this long without anyone reporting it
lol im very paranoid about member permissions because there's often bots that join and try to DM anyone that they can see. I have it so verified members aren't affected and don't show up for the bots. But if people are in the neatq then they could get spammed with phishing dms
yea makes sense, i‚Äôll test tonight and see if it‚Äôs fine
is there a way so everyone can register without help of an admin?
yea, change /requireregister
i want them to register by themselves
is it possible or
what do you want them to register
I used /autoroles topplayers set role:Role number:1
however nothing changed :/
do I need to do something to make the #1 player get a role?
owait
I need to do it from the leaderboard channel huh
altho now I'm getting

> That role appears higher on the role's hierarchy, so I cannot manage it!
jk I'm dumb
just make sure NeatQueue's role is above that role
EZ it worked
he just be thinking about it
i turned captain voting for map and when it comes to map pick it doesnt give the option to ban maps just gives the option for everyone to vote for a map
you have map bans enabled?
`/map bans`
why cant i inv the bot to my server?
what happens when u try
This is a weird request, is it possible currently to have anyone currently in a match get a Role in Discord?
nvm this was for a hack that doesn't matter
I'm trying to make a tool that'll figure out everyone that's currently live... but it's not gonna work with a Cloudflare Worker on a cron rip
NeatZ... what are the chances you'd be able to make a somewhat completely unrelated endpoint just for our server that'll get all the Discord users that are currently "Streaming" (aka live on Twitch, based on their Discord activity), and return the list of their Twitch users üëÄ
is the bot free?
do i need premium to use the neat q bot?
The bot is free for your first 500 people, 50 daily games, and 3 different queues
so on the dc server can play 500 players for free
and max 3 q
Yeah I'm pretty sure
ok is there somewhere a dokumation?
Documentation? https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/
ey sry my mistake
all good!
well anyways, yes
sure that‚Äôs easy at least with the integration i think
although you could also just add a bot and get the info yourself, doesn‚Äôt matter
i‚Äôll just make an endpoint to fetch all live users, no biggie
Yeah I can do that, so no pressure. Just was trying to avoid spinning up my own bot. Mostly just laziness üòõ
up to you, gonna update this morning, so lmk
Go for it if you can üôÇ
It says authorization complete but not actually showing that it is authorized for the server
what kind of return val do you want
I can work with anything you give me. The plan is to have a "currently live" section on our site.

So honestly, if you want to return the teams maybe you can make the API more useful for others, something like a list of `games` where each game has the name of the teams `Team <captain>` vs `Team <captain>` (or just return the captain). And a list of everyone on the team, then you can list whether the person is live or not. Basically just `isLive` and either their platform username (i.e. Twitch username) or just a link to their stream and I can parse from there
that makes more sense
Then I feel less guilty about this feature request üòÑ
üòÖ bad news, neatqueue does not have the required Discord intents to view activities, so you are gonna need your own bot
Rip all good, thank you for trying!
ill add the endpoint for matches still, but yea youll need to check yourself
That'll still help me a ton, so I appreciate it üôÇ
(if you can include the Discord channel ids in the API response, that'd help even more, but no worries if not)
sure its updating now, endpoint is GET `/api/matches/{server_id}`
this should be fixed
That was quick, you're the best!
np, for the missing intent to view activities, about 6 months ago I enabled it, and was immediately spammed with 1 API request for everytime someone's status changed
idk how any bot can support that
lolwat
that's wild lmfao
its dumb but its all grouped together, the "Presence" intent
so its all or nothing
so you're saying I'm gonna be spammed with that now üòõ
depends on the server, if its just Pro City thats like a few hundred right
opposed to 700,000 for neatqueue
pssh whats a few hundred thousand requests
i like to call it DDoS, Discord Denial of Service
lmfao
I was drowning in Discord docs the other night trying to get this to working
only to realize I'd need to throw up some code on my actual server instead of a CF worker
I thought I was so smart until I tried to run it
it can't work?
yeah something about how the bot connects and CF worker's infra? idk
maybe if I didn't use a library and manually wrote it all via network requests it'd work, but idek how that'd work
but I couldn't use discord.js and the worker
yea im not too sure
smh discord.js also
üëÄ what do you have against discord.js
Is there an alternative?
nothing really, just the fact i used python
the API wrapper I use is called Disnake, which I contribute to sometimes
ah gotcha
CF Workers are in JS so I'm kinda stuck there
true
oops I deleted that when you started typing
well yes, i also added events for join/leave
I'm thinking out loud and answered my own question lmfao
Gonna just have an endpoint on my server that just replies to a webhook, uses my bot to query presence, and updates some cache. ez
ty for all your help
dont even bother replying, my bot doesn't care
it just sends and moves on
er yeah, that's what I meant. listens not replies*
but perfect üòÑ
lmk if you have any questions about discord api wrappers though, theyre all the same basically
will let you know!
Can the initial elo be changed? All players
yea, `/startingmmr`
Hey m8s did u have problems with the VC in the bot?
what issue are u having?
We are having issues within our server as the bot is muting people entering the queue and allowing players to move between voice channels. And we didn`t put anything in the bot, some issues start after the bought of the premium version of the bot
there was a change today that made created voice channels obey the permissions set by your category
im the <@597093261622116383> mates and we solved it like u mentioned
but now we have the problem that the rest of the players that are not in the queue can see and join all the queues chats and vc
before players only can see the queues where they be
i dont know if i explained it well <@145305657237700608>
if you disable View Channel perms in the category that should fix it
its solved i think
thanks and sorry for waste your time cause i sometimes slow in the disc permissions
no worries, i understand it may seem counter productive but it gives you more control over the permissions of created channels
heyo, the server i am admin in currently has a problem where people can't see the temporary vc's for their team or the temp queue vc
probably this^
check the perms and see what the category is likely missing
thank you
Error code: ZJIFE
everytime we start a game it says this
the bot is missing permissions
what permissions is it missing
it cant edit the channel
well, it cant mute the players
we just need the game to start
so do we allow it to mute the players?
and it will be fixed?
you need to give the bot enough perms yes
ok one sec
if you dont really what to deal with it, just give it admin
so do we just give the bot to do everything?
yea thats the easy approach
<@773200669032841247> the bot is missing perms
in the premium-queue channel/category
it cant create channels
Okay thanks
Can you see if it's fixed now?
i cant really check, i can just see in the logs it didnt have enough perms
fixed now, thanks
sorry, thats not really something i can control
people are adding the bot just fine
if its not showing the server in the list, then you dont have perms to add bots
do you need to buy premium to access dashboard?
no, the dashboard currently only has premium status/purchasing
oh, so nothing i can access there besides purchasing premium?
ok thank you :D!
How Do have it so the Q channel is only shown to the players.
and not the whole discord
change the permissions of the channel
For some reason when the match ends it deletes the Text channel but keeps the voice channel open
plz help
Also is there a way to completly whipe any changes i made to the bot like factory reset it?
just /endqueue
this is strange though, i would say permission issue but probably not
im investigating permission stuff now
maybe
Might be on my end
if you give it admin itll work
/endqueue will fully reset any settings?
if you have a category permissions override that modifies the NeatQueue *role*, it might be breaking it
including starting mmr, captian pick order etc
yes, itll be saved in a config but no longer in the channel
Can i wipe the config
or is that unnescesary
no need
also you cant
lastly <@145305657237700608> what are the draft types
Im SOO confused
like 1-1-1-1-1
1-2-2-2-2
Plz plz help
yea, its the number of picks per team
so...
Straight (1-1-1-1) = Team 1, Team 2, Team 1, Team 2...
Snake (1,2,2,2) = Team 1, Team 2, Team 2, Team 1, Team 1, Team 2...
and what is 1-1/2-1-1-1
If the pick for Team 1 is higher MMR than the captain of Team 2, then Team 2 gets 2 picks instead of 1
so whats the best one for just a regular 10man game
snake is usually most fair
Team 1 gets first pick (best player), so team 2 gets the second and third best players
What is register and IGN used for
I dont see any use for turning those on
And /register is for the in game name, or discord, or what??
`/requireregister` and `/requireign` control those
register will fetch your rating from some other game, ign just sets your account
both will display your account in Discord when teams are made
wait so both do the same thing?
im confused im so sorry :(
not trying to be a hastle
both will show your account, but register will actually go and fetch the rating associated with the account
so for /register u should enter your IGN?
and it shows IGN+rating
it will set your MMR in neatqueue to whatever rating was fetched
only works the first time you use it, before you are in the system
Can i dissable match making range?
I want the MMR system but I dont want it to affect matchmaking
like I want the leaderboards but I dont want it to affect queue times or anything like that
I set it to 0
Will that affect the match making times
you should probably change your /queuetype to PUGS then
Ok thankyou <3
but yes, you could just make the range like 5000
but it would behave the same as PUGs
ok I see thanks
I see these other servers having multiple queue channels
Why would I ever want that?
If everyone is the same level queueing for the same game
Why would I have 3+ queue channels
if you are using matchmaking, you wouldnt really want it
Hey thanks for making the bot and all the support! Just wanted to ask if you happened to know what the error code "OMAWA" is for? I figured it might be something to do with permissions but not 100% certain.
yea there was a change to how the bot creates channels, but its causing too much confusion LOL, im gonna revert it
Thank you!
restarting now, but this change WILL go through eventually
but what if im doing PUGS?
gotcha, would you happen to have an ETA?
is it still stupid?
sorry, this change had to be reverted temporarily
no, its pretty useful for pugs cuz you can create multiple tiers of queues
so you can have a queue for lower ratings, higher ratings, etc
but if its all for the same rating?
but with matchmaking it kinda isnt needed, cuz everyone can be in the same queue
Like everyone is exactly same skill level
then no point
Ok thank you :)
Ur the best, im sure im being realy annoying im so sorry :(
no you aren't, no worries, im the first to admit the documentation isnt very thorough
I totaly understand
the documentation is autogenerated from the commands for the most part, and commands have a stupidly short max length
like 100 characters
This whole project is wonderfull
honestly
thankyou for puting in the hard work <3
appreciate it ‚ù§Ô∏è
My mmr wont show everyone else in the servers show but mine doesnt work. Im the owner
It wont show next to my name only in the queues
unfortunately bots are unable to nickname the server owner
in order to nickname someone, you need more perms, but its impossible to have more perms than the owner
gotcha thank you
hey i also voted and I cannot access the leaderboard
Vote again <@367079947631853579>
Probly didnt go through
I did
cuz it works for everyone else
maybe bot is down
wait like 2 mins
just tried and it worked fine
<@145305657237700608> Hey man, just wanted to ask in your oppinion would you say its good to have /register for a Valorant 10man PUGS server?
meh, i would say no usually, people like being detached from their competitive rating, its like a fresh start
alr I see
but also it makes fairer matchest faster
okok
The voice channels that the bot create are newly Push to talk, is that from our side or from the bot?
your side, we have channels set up from the bot and none of them are PTT
Check your category settings where you placed the bot and/or the permissions of your normal members
yea definitely didn‚Äôt touch that perm
now my server cannot use stats button
<@145305657237700608>
did you manually change someone's stats
somehow you have -1 games
Guys,

Had a query 

After Map 1 and Map 2 being selected 

Why does the bot show all 7 Maps for Map 3 even after banning 4 maps and choosing 2
could you share your config /save
ok one sec, sorry for the late reply
GKULX
<@145305657237700608>
what do you see? When i did the map bans it only shows 3 maps
Can you come VC?
i can show you
sorry working rn
if you are talking about this , the bot has no idea that these are maps
it treats them as a completely separate idea
<@145305657237700608> 

When Team 1 and Team 2 Do 2 Bans Each 

and then pick 2 Maps Each 

the Map remaining should automatically be called 


But then the bot asks for MAP SELECTION
if you want 2 maps each, it needs to be a best of 4 at least
So if i delete this voting menu, Can the bot still do veto?
map bans are used in place of veto
No i want it to be a Best of 3

7 Maps Total 

4 Banned 

3 Get picked 

the 1 remaining should automatically get selected right?
if its a best of 3, you only need 3 maps
Then i can remove the voting menu?
so if i delete the voting meny
the bot will still ask for bans and picks right?
yea, /votingmenu is a completely separate system
Ahhhh Okayyyyyy
used for Region votes, Attack/Defence, etc
Ohhhhhhh
Can u help me with an image
how do i set the sides
wdym
Like a tutorial or a image which can help me setup sides
like how can you get a team to pick a side?
yea some image
idk what you mean image
leave it ‚ù§Ô∏è
I put Captain selection to vote
but the bot didnt put up a pop up asking to choose captain
you have to be using captain selection
otherwise there is no captain
i put this but it did not show a Pop up
like vote for captain
i even put team selection to votes
and draft type to hybrid 2
Breh üíÄ
Thanks <@145305657237700608>
<@145305657237700608> 

also is there a way i can set the system to "number of maps" instead of a Bo1 of Bo3
no that wouldnt really make sense
if u said 3 maps, you wouldnt play the 3rd map if Team 1 won both map 1 and map 2
Yea, Gotchu
in the voting menu, 

i added 2 voting menu's 1 for Map 1 and other for Map 2 

Its asking both the captains for side
but if map 1 is chosen by Team 1, Team 2 CAP should get sides right?
<@145305657237700608>

change the team voting
also, check Spelling of "Haven" Map, its HEAVEN in the embeds
YEssir Thank You So Much
idk what you mean
bro thats your own config, YOU spelled it like that
or if its someone else's config, someone else did
<@145305657237700608> Hey sorry to bother you
how do i log channel?
`/staffchannel`
can the map ban/veto system be modified?
to **ban ban pick pick ban ban decider**
<@145305657237700608>
no, currently map bans happen before picks
Ahh aight ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
<@145305657237700608> is it possible that a player be everytime Captain for a Team?
I can't scroll to see all the awards on my phone. You can take a picture of all the bonuses and their properties
yea my website doesn't look great on mobile
ill try to fix it at some point
you can specify the captain selection modes, that as close as you can get
how can i make it so that a specific role can see all the match queues?
you can mark it as a `/spectatorrole`
but i want them to write in it as well
also cancel etc
that would probably be a staff role
cuz thats alot of control for a role
yeah the "specific role" is a staff role
Does one of the que types have captains pick teams from a list? I couldn't figure out which one
then /staffrole
yea, PUGs
and how can i delete the status button?
you cant, not with anonymousqueue on
oh kk
hello
i cant report win
guys
i cant report
i cant report my win
in this server
https://discord.gg/rankedleague
dont worry, talking to admin for your server
the issue is that the bot couldnt store any info for the server, too many games played to store
ok thankyou
how long till it will be sorted do you guys know?
i cant fix the matches that are broken, only ensure next matches work
thats up to the admins
ah ok mate
<@145305657237700608> why can‚Äôt I report my win
read the chat numpty
I need elo
how can i change the queue message to a different channel?
<@145305657237700608>
you cant
do i need to redo the setup?
<@145305657237700608>  im getting interactions failed?
<@145305657237700608> has it been sorted yet in ranked league? i cant join another queue cus cant report result
bot was restarting
whats it say
no option to report at all
no when u try to queue
think u need to overide the bot and report the result somehow
idek
get a staff member to try /outcome
the bot keeps randomly resetting people's mmr and the leaderboard
like people queued a game and their mmr got reset but the people who havent queued still have normal
also it keeps making the channels private so other people in the server cant see theres games going on idk how to fix
<@145305657237700608>
do you have monthly leaderboard enabled
change the perms for the category
How do I vote for a que or reset we accidentally didn't vote on it before it got deleted
It was a test and got busy after playing around with it now it won't let me join a que
I'm dumb
Nvm I fixxed it
is there a way to remove the timeout it gives you if you don't get into the lobby fast enough
no but you can change the timer
however long lobby timers are at risk of having the match cancelled when the bot needs to restart
~~any configs for other games?~~ Actually, can you run multiple/different queues in the same server with the bot? Example, one Val and another OW
In different channels yes
<@188103205199020032>
thank you!
Aight NeatZ I had a wild idea, hear me out
It started off as:

What if we had a queue VC everyone goes in, deafened and no perms to speak.
Then when a queue pops it auto moves the first people in VC to a lobby
And it could even play sounds then like "Match Found"
Then I realized, that wouldn't work for anonymous mode
Then I thought something else
THEN I thought
We keep the button "Join Queue", but when someone joins the queue the bot makes a custom voice channel just for that person in queue. Only the person in queue could see it, and there'd be one VC for everyone in queue (this would only work for smaller servers). The person can optionally join that VC while waiting in queue, when the queue pops, it moves them from that VC into the lobby VC and can maybe even play a "Match Found" sound once everyone waiting in VC was moved
anyways, just a random idea LOL
idk how possible the idea is
that is a possible idea, i would just worry about discord worst limit ever
you can only create 500 channels per day in a server
oh :/
i would just need a way to reuse channels, which i need to do anyways
either way it'd only work for small channels
there was a suggestion to have a waiting room channel, but yea that is hard with anonymous queues
yeah :/
but like, if you are automatically moved, you can still be AFK
yeah, but at least for tarik's discord usually people are at their PC but afk
oh you mean they could be in VC but afk and we'd have no way of knowing
its the same function of making voice channels optional
sure it makes matches start faster, but also people can just stall a game
anyone got cod configs?
Do you know how the /tts command works?
does it only work if you have the channel focused?
i have no clue honestly
that would be so funny, tts Match Found
Match Found
i imagine you need the channel open
im mad I heard that
LMFAO
yeah probably need the channel open
That was timing
probs should disable that üòÑ
yeah sorry LOL
I wonder if we could just have it run in a set channel
like just tell everyone to sit in our general chat and it'll announce when a queue pops
that'd honestly be a nice feature if you could add that
probably kinda niche
but then everyone gets the message
Could have it in the queue channel?
yeaaa but thats like the same thing
Sure, but I imagine anyone in the queue channel cares if a queue is found
twitch bot that spams chat
actually not a terrible idea
I was thinking we could have a bot that uses the Valorant internal API and sends in-game messages
yeah a Twitch bot could work
but not everyone streams
bouta just send a SMS LOL
you could jerry rig a bot running valorant but probably against TOS
meh who needs TOS
is there a way to make it so more people can join the voice channel without increasing the team size?
people just want to watch in discord stream but I don't wanna keep dragging them in
yes!
spectator role
we set it up with our server for the exact reason
use /spectatorrole add role:(your chosen role)
great ty
yep and then just add that to people
soon enough `/spectatorrole` won't be needed cuz you can just add the spectator role to the categories permission's but not yet
spectator role also changes how private channels are created though, instead of being locked to 5 people they're unlimited and private ya?
right yea
hmmm never mind i guess
still needed in that sense
although, the 5 player limit isnt actually needed since the only people with perms for the channel are the players
its more just a visual
ye, could be removed entirely
Yo guys, has there been a bot update where players cant see the other voice channels that pop?
by default now, the created channels inherit the view_channel permission set for @ everyone
you probably had the permission disabled, but the bot was overriding it, now the bot will follow that permission
oh i see
Can i revert it back so everyone can see?
you just have to go into the category permissions
i assume you have `@everyone: View Channel = Deny`
Honestly im lost üòÖ
The category the channels are in decide who can view it
For example, in the Discord here, the "General" and "Support" voice channels are in the "General" category
so if you want anyone to be able to view the voice channels, make sure that everyone can view the "General" category
or whatever category applies to you
oh yes yes
I thought it was a bot command haha
legends
trying to move most permission things away from commands
just gives more customization that way
Any update on the channel stats? Like the server here has?
no rush, just curious
üòÑ no havent touched it
currently fixing the issue of the top server exceeding the document size of 16mb for a mongodb collection, which is wild
for match history
mongodb things
curse my design decisions
any reason why you used mongo? curious
mostly cuz when I first started the bot just for a single server, it just used a json file
so most the data was just json structured
ngl i used json files for at least 100 servers
hey neatz, the 500 channel hard limit. is there any way to get around or avoid it? We might reach that once we open applications if games continuously run throughout the day
nobody has hit it yet so it hasn't been a high priority, my plan is just to stop deleting channels around ~450 for the day, and start reusing them for the rest of the day
put the inactive channels in a hidden channel pool category
gotcha okay. then maybe 500 is farther than I am estimating
cross that bridge if we get there then
yea basically, idk how close anyone has gotten but haven't hit it yet
just an annoying thing to have to add
G'day NeatZ
<a:vollSTEER:815816922179305492>
I got a small question for this command
"/timer matchcleanup"
default is 5.4k sec
it means after 5.4k sec the match will force end?
yep exactly, after 5400 seconds, whichever team has the most votes will get the win
but what if match over 5.4k sec and there is still no result?
itll mark as a tie
and also end the temporary voice channel?
like I got a match yesterday. It lasted over 90mins
and all the players got kicked out from the temporary VC all of sudden
yep, it ends the match as if people voted for the result
roger
Hey Neat
you do know that Pro player Tarik is currently using your bot
huge congrats on that
<:FeelsAmazingVoll:816416991111413762>
LOL yes i do, him and the admins are in here
yeah
I saw the chat history
hope more and more ppl will discover this treasure and make it big
thanks for your dedication
sorry
I got one more
Emptying queue due to 60 minutes of inactivity.
what if I want to disable this function or longer the timer?
is this "/timer afk" command reference to this?
thanks for the nice comments ‚ù§Ô∏è
`/timer afk` is the individual AFK timer per player, that timer you are talking about is
`/timer queuereset`
thanks
sorry It ain't much
but your bot truly helped me a lot
thanks so much! glad the bot could help you out !
How to reset the MMR for all participants to the initial elo
The person that will miss a queue even though it says they're in queue got a screenshot of what it looks like
/resetstats mmr
Is that how it should be? it's been 5 minutes
And everything is already gone. How long will the reset last
hi <@145305657237700608>, Thanks for the bot. Do u have any idea why the channel is hidden? it wasnt hidden yesterday. Any commands I can use to unhide it? thanks!
Alright so I‚Äôm gonna try and do a draft league tourny and I would love to use the bot for it , trying to figure out the best way to optimize it, simple and stupid I want to hand select captains and I can do this without using the the bot for ease of use because people dumb, but I like the idea of using it for ease of party chats and it will tell people to make it to the next party ?
<@145305657237700608>
Smite doesn‚Äôt have many people using this bot except for double a wich I know knows the creator of the bot
hmm alright i‚Äôll check it out
maybe the status isn‚Äôt waiting for a confirmation of getting in queue
looks fine, guess it followed up in the wrong message
change the category perms, the bot now follows the perms for view channel
there isn‚Äôt really a way to ‚Äúmanually‚Äù select a captain, the whole point is that it‚Äôs interactive for the users
I gotcha it let me select myself as a captain so I didn‚Äôt exactly understand what was going on
wdym select yourself
Don‚Äôt quite understand what a party captain is , I think it‚Äôs the captain of the whole thing now that I‚Äôve thought about it more
parties are just ways to group up with players in a queue
the party captain is the one who queues the party
do u mean category for @/everyone?
but then it will make it as everyone can see and join the call right?
I gotcha so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the best to use for a tournament? I still want to know what would be the best way, full team vs full team, without captains
And do the team captains prior
View channel lets them see, Connect lets them join
It‚Äôs a unique situation I‚Äôm in I think and I‚Äôm new to using the bot
But want to use it
if you do Full Team vs Full Team, players need to create a full team party to queue
They have to do it individually
if you have team size 4, with queuetype Full Team vs Full Team, in order to join the queue you must be a captain of a party of 4
Right
<@145305657237700608> is there anyway, management can see which player's have joined queue?
*while anonymous queue is on*
currently, no not easily
Damn ok
<@145305657237700608> How do i activate captains only vote?
`/captainselection` and `/teamselection`
this needs to be added though
thanks
U mean, ya'll will be working or it or?
yea ill add it
.suggest Show current queue players in `/info`
Your suggestion has been submitted to the server staff for review!
Thanks, How do i change to only captains vote during veto?
`/map voting`
Thanks Man <@145305657237700608>
Sorry for bothering you
no prob!
when i create a lobby, then the teams are decided, the opposite team VC dissapears from my view, how do i stop this
that only happens if nobody is in the channel
deletes cuz its not needed
nah theres 2 people in lobby, we sort into teams and then i cant see their team
i can show photo if youd like
you can update the category to let everyone see the channel
but also i should change it to give view channel perms to all players in the match
you mean from discord?
i am a mod... XD HAHA
i cant see the team once its sorted its strange
you must not have view channel perms
if there are actually people in the channel
hey neat!
sorry to bother
ppl got banned after joining queue vc but some1 didn't show up
and all the other 9 players got banned for 3 mins
is this normal?
uhh no, the 1 person should have gotten banned
the one who didn't show up?
thanks
did they leave the voice channel
I was afk at that moment
so I don't actually know the real situation
probably some ppl also left
alright, when a queue is cancelled from someone not joining, anyone NOT in the voice channel at the time of cancellation is banned for 3 mins
is there any command to set the time shorter?
or it's forcefully?
`/player autoban`
thanks
our voting system is gone
you need an admin to manually select the outcome, im still making a fix for the server
how we contact teh admin
<@145305657237700608> 

In a b03 when the Match was about to start [Map 3] the temp channels got vanished?
how do i keep them active until a winner is voted
JHNWQ
was anyone in the channel
They were
but were deafened
are you sure they didnt leave the channel?
yes They did not
u can check the config
Mass switch happened
<@145305657237700608> any idea why it happened?
no thats very weird
Damnn
I was in another VC
players who were in VC
came to me and said
Bro VC's got deleted
we were about to play Match 3
can you check who deleted the channel
should be in the audit log
Ok wait
<@145305657237700608>
did the match cancel or soemthing?
the bot only moves to the lobbychannel upon match cancel or match completion,
No Man
<@145305657237700608> any idea>
How does it decide match completion?
is it the winner message timer?
either people vote, or the matchcleanup timer happens
which is 90 mins by default
ahh thats why
mystery solved
i should probably just increase the default to like 3 hours
ahahahaha
i just fdid, put it to 3 and a half
<@145305657237700608> Also anyway that i can Combine leaderboards of all Queue's
<@862441990247284736> fact
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
<@145305657237700608> thanks
This is the result
This is LB
Why is it empty?
you have to refresh it
i did
multiple times
i  even changed queue name now
that leaderboard you sent wasnt refreshed
if you did /queuename, that also doesn't copy stats over
sorted.
<@145305657237700608> how do i remove a loss?
or a win
`/add`
<@145305657237700608> is there a cooldown on add command?
I just added mmr to 5 player, now i have to add losses to losing team
its not showing the pop up
probably just ur discord bugging, i cant control that
Sadge, i had to restart DC
also LMK when u do the Info thingy
where can i buy premium
to play more than 50 games
the website is not loading
true, weird
one min
back
why a cant pay with pp
the payments are through stripe
i have no bank account
i only have paypal
is it a abo?
abo?
that i have to pay it monthly
the credits are withdrawn monthly, but you dont need to actually buy them monthly
can only the owner of the discord credit buy?
anyone with manage_channels perms should be able to view the server's dashboard
I don't see the join or leave que button on my android phone.
So I have todo it on pc instead
make sure your discord is up to date
When subbing someone in, the timer doesn't reset so if there's only 10 seconds left and someone subs in, if the new person doesn't join in 10 seconds it gets cancelled
yea they two things are kinda asynchronous of each other, but also i feel like it maybe shouldnt extend the timer
cuz anyone can try to sub, it would make people wait
potentially timer only gets bumped when someone accepts sub?
cause yeah you could just spam sub and have timer go up and up
yea, getting subbed in should give you some time atleast
otherwise if u get subbed in with 5 seconds left, you're gonna get the ban LOL
ye my bad I meant when they accept the sub
at the end of map bans there is always a duplicate of 1 map
is there a way to avoid this
you probably added the map twice
is there a command to view active map pool
its in /info
fixed
thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
hey NeatZ
the queue
is like frozen
know how to fix it
its saying interaction failed
same, did the bot crash?
hey guys is the bot down for maintenance ?
<@145305657237700608> halp <:PepeHands:443899749771509760>
Same here üò¶
Bot got some problems
Just wait for <@145305657237700608>
On strike
Same as here

Basically neatQueue is crushing and unavailable for any users atm
Just wait for NeatZ
<:Sadge:857951164037201933>

gotta wait
Ahhh Shucks Mann, troubles
<@145305657237700608>Ping us when the issue is solved
ü•∫ still broken I assume
Why is the bot not working?
No one can enter the queue
<@145305657237700608>
<@145305657237700608> ü•∫ 

Give some update m8
i assume he's working at it üëç don't gotta spam him

Bots working in my server
```its fixed```
<a:LETSFUCKINGGO:842555369636888587>
Thanks <@145305657237700608>
<@145305657237700608> Thanks bro ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanks <@145305657237700608> just saved us
nah, thats really annoying that happened, hasnt happened before
why is the website always down
Hey Neat is there any way to only show mmr on the queue, like if me <@152476694505062400> - 987 elo joins the queue to show a 987
how do I add a side peak?
whats that
like in anonymous queue?
I mean if it‚Äôs Anonymus you just don‚Äôt see anything
And if it‚Äôs not you see the whole nickname
Would it be a way to only display the elo of the user looking for a match ?
i feel like that wouldnt be too helpful
Well, the peak of the parties, for example, so that the participants in the queue, distributed which team they will be in, in Red or in blue
<@145305657237700608>
i dont understand
thanks for the fix neatz
np, working on a fix to prevent in the future
apparently its just something that happens
<@145305657237700608> Anyway the NQ can record the veto as well?
and show it in Queue results
here
sure i can add that
Please Do ‚ù§Ô∏è Would be Awesome
<@145305657237700608> how do i find total number of matches hosted
It's be nice if bot shows the match number in queue results and also input of a command
`/serverstats`
was thinking of changing queue numbers to be specific per server
<@145305657237700608> do you mind if I get the access as well? If for whatever reason sirhype is offline, etc
sure
That'd be great
appreciate it
I think I need #logs as well still
<@145305657237700608> quick question what is the point of the (balance by roles/mmr) when captains pick the teams or is there a way to disable captains
its useless unless you are using the Balanced team selection
im using the balance by role mode rn
should I turn on the beta matchmaking
matchmaking currently does not obey the balance by roles (fully)
it does to an extent
ill note it down to fix though
alrighty thanks
btw since we can set auto roles based on mmr
is there a way to assign roles manually which have a custom starting mmr in the system
or is that not a thing
when players queue, they will get the autoroles that they are within the range
if that answers
no I know it does that however lets say I had a new player join and I know there avg rank alr instead of me setting the mmr manually to the player so they get the auto role I could do the inverse and set the role of the player and when they queue they would be given the initial mmr to be in that role
if this were possible you wouldn't need to change the beta matchmaking
ya feel me
ah yes
`/startingmmr`
i can set that for each role?
ok thank you
how do I set games to auto draft captains
you can force captain selection /teamselection, and force the captain selection mode wit h /captainselection
I saw it eariler and cant find it now how to enable only the captain of each team voting for maps
<@145305657237700608> yo any idea how many mins the maintenance might last?
Worst case scenario
Bcoz players in our HUB are the most active during the 7-12 period
well the maintenance will only be about 1 minute, but if there are issues I would need to revert to a backup of the database
not anticipating issues obviously, been testing everything and seems aight
most updates i don‚Äôt even announce cuz i can just kinda quickly do them
GOD ü´°
<@145305657237700608> if i made 2 same name queues just now, their leaderboard will be automatically combined right? or will i have to link again
yes, queues with the same name share the same leaderboard
doing /link does nothing to link leaderboards, it just links channels to other channels for using commands
Ahh Nice ‚ù§Ô∏è
Ohhhhhh i see thanks
<@145305657237700608> Also what if i put Vote for result off?
Is it possible to change the mmr for an individual player?
yes, use `/add mmr`
or /set
there won‚Äôt be any chance to vote for a winner
it‚Äôll just make teams and delete channels after
HHow will the results be updated then?
manual?
no there are no results
no winners or losers
ohh fk ok
can i make voteforresults to captain only?
interesting idea, but no
the purpose of voteforresults Disabled is if you don‚Äôt want, or don‚Äôt care about results
but maybe a way to change who can vote for the winner
Hmm, My players are forgetting to vote for results and the mmr doesnt update as they dont decide the winner
i was just thinking if there could be an alternative
the match will automatically resolve a winner after the match cleanup timer, you can always have staff select the winner too
how will it automatically resolve? üëÄ
also, how do i hide MMR to only visible when a player is in queue
<@145305657237700608>
It should pick the team with the most votes, if I remember correctly
yea ik, i am talking bout, if i remove winner voting, how will it decide a winner? or will i have to manually choose winenrs
hello guys
Ah I'm not sure, I imagine you'll have to manually choose winners. But NeatZ can reply when awake
how can i make everyone able to create a queue not only admins?
ye ye ‚ù§Ô∏è
everyone shouldn't be able to create queue
admins create, players join and play no?
i get it
thank u for helping me‚ô•
It is possible to make it so that the elo is not deducted from the players in case of defeats , but only added in case of victories
in MMR loss leaving it empty should work ig
<@145305657237700608> is the best man tho
<@145305657237700608> Is there anyway we can put auto refresh to leaderboard?
no winner vote = no winners
you can‚Äôt select a winner, it won‚Äôt let you
yes, /mmr change set loser_mmr
you can override the loser mmr change
is the bot down again? <@145305657237700608>
<#919709100114346076>
nvm i saw the announcement my bad
sry for the ping
its going slooooow
about 1/4 the way done
<@145305657237700608> the premium site is not opening
whats the problem.. i have to upgrade
the bot is down for maintenance
Can i buy it from you?
might as well just wait, i cant give you anything manually until the bot comes online
probs another 10 minutes
bot down?
83,000 out of 130,000 done
Almost
100,000
sheesh
i may have underestimated how long it would take lol
locally it takes a few seconds, but since the database is on a different server its gotta go back and forth alot
120,000...
done
bot coming online
DOne
Unexpected error occured
Join the Support Server for more information!
Error code: MUDHX
Bot down ?
one sec
no, somehow that server still has too many matches stored
queue 166832 with error code  MUDHX still open withoute a possibility to vote or leave for play
which team won
ill see if we can still vote for a winner
specgru
is that team 1 or team 2
2 i think
if its the right hand side one ,yes
lets see what happens
work?
yess
thank you appreciate ‚ù§Ô∏è
<@145305657237700608> how do i disabel sub command for players?
what command
Hey NeatZ, is it possible to transfer a leaderboard from one server to a different server?
Or are the leaderboards server specific
i can help you out with it
Oh yeah that'd be appreciated!
you can share leaderboards by using global queues, but that wont help if you already have stats since it creates a new shared leaderboard
Gotcha, I think we're ok with starting fresh but it would be fun to have our stats carry over üòÖ
msg me in DMs and we can do it real quick
anyone able to help me setup the leaderboard in my server?
what are you stuck on
well i have the queue running and weve played a match, but the leaderboard isnt linked properly
and the ./leaderboard command goes to a blank page
which server is this?
UW-Madison Valorant
looks like you dont have any stats under the queue name "10 Mans"
i see stats under the name "Queue"
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
so i just need to change the name of the queue to "Queue"?
no, your queue is named "Queue" you should change your leaderboard
unless, did you play a game, then rename the queue?
yea they mustve
do this
`/queuename Queue`
`/rename 10 Mans`
first command changes the name to point to the existing stats, second command renames all stats to the new name
the second command didnt respond
it should work, try the steps again and see
if not i can join
the application still did not respond to the second command
looks like it worked though
ok, ill try this next game rn and let you know if i still have any issues
thanks for the help!
Substitute Command
how do i disable
goto your server's Integrations tab
well the leaderboard still isnt linked for me unfortunately
what do you see
any chance you could join the server and help me fix this? theres some additional issues now after this last game too
if neatz isn't free, I can try and help you dm me an invite
o i see he offered, neatz is dope
sure i can join
I'm settin' em up with my valo cfg, it looks like some things were just not configured all the way
sick, thx
Is the bot restarting?
shouldn't be?
yes it is
silly Kotri <:zamKappa:910320944386547743>
I didn't see a message
oh well
bug identified
Anyone have a few minutes to hop in my server help me out I just purchased premium (not sure if I need it even XD) but I'm trying to get a basic overwatch PUGs queue going and I'm having trouble ‚ù§Ô∏è
<@145305657237700608> can you confirm we're already hitting the 500 player ceiling on our server ? (ID: 317207764227325952)
i can help you mate
you do have 500 players in the database, but seems like many of them havent queued
i should update how it counts
oh, nvm the counting is right
ok all g, 1 sec
hey, if spectators join a queue it looks like they count as the player joining and the queue will pop
***the channel for prelobby, after a queue pops
uh let me explain that better.
queue popped, 9/10 people joined the channel, 1 spectator joined and then the game counted it as the 10th and started even though 1 person never actually connected
true! i wrote that code like 1.5 years ago before spectators, thats a good catch
would never have caught it without this happening lmao
it just checks the number of people in the channel
cool, itll be fixed tomorrow
also changed so that if people set their IGN, it will show up no matter if /requireign is enabled
nice !
If you do the /substitute and it gets an error of "did not agree to be subbed in!"
what are some troubleshooting things I could do?
did the other player accept the substitution?
sooooooooooooooo, remember how you transferred over the stats for the month on tarik server
well, the peoples were talking and monthly reset is probably good :( sorry for making you do extra work
Currently though, it doesn't seem to be tracking the monthly stats, it reset properly but nothing is populating
wdym its not tracking the monthly stats
I switched over the stats to monthly, then we played 2 games after and nothing has updated on the leaderboard
https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/317207764227325952/1068275882977918977
just is empty
hmm only january stats
so its currently on monthly
its showing you dont have any matches played this month
correct
so for your account, you dont have any stats in the database
it does look like mmr is being recorded though
https://getrekt.cc/Ldk9Gl.png
oh actually
did you change the settings after the match was made?
no, changed settings then queued after
actually maybe it just took a game or two, mmr is showing 1000
the last match of yours was tracked in the monthly bucket
2023-02-4 03:17 was 5 mins ago
gotcha okay
yep, just me being paranoid
i think
MMR is showing 1000 now so, let me do this match then I'll update
you don't have to agree with me being paranoid
no i agreed with that time being 5 mins ago LOL
unexpected error occurred Error code: OFVVB
bot missing permissions to create a channel
oh ok
how can I change the starting MMR after a queue is created
I fixed it
Thank you for updating VC perms so it's not visible to everyone! I just wanted to let you know it's still not pulling permissions of the category - only adding mod admins (and obviously server admins) and the people in the q. Would there be a way to vet for an option to add a role that would be able to view the VC's without the ability to join? OR just completely copy the perms of the category? Having some complaints that they can't see if a q is going on
if not totally understandable and I'm happy that it can be hidden by non-verified members
it should be possible to copy all permissions, was having some issues with it that one day, but i should be able to figure it out
how to disable "substitute" command for Players
hi <@145305657237700608> is there any way we can have the old option where ppl in the server that doesnt have a specific role to see people in the "game call", we would love to have that feature as it would show that our server is actually "alive". Thanks!
you just need to have view access for "@Everyone"
<@145305657237700608>
your servers integration tab
ok where do i find it?
server settings
<@145305657237700608> Check Dm's ‚ù§Ô∏è
So currently im having an issue where the created channels arent being made with some roles, so they are in effect private and unseeable for people wondering if theres a game going on
yea, currently created channels don‚Äôt inherit the permissions of the category, but they inherit the view channels perm you set for @ everyone
are there any plans to implement that as a feature at some point?
yes, it was implemented but reverted due to permission issues
Every server has its own data base right? Is there anyway to combine data of 2 servers?
neatqueue has a single database, but data is by server
the data can be combined, just not by you
is there a way i can only unlock specific queues or does it just unlock all of them no matter what
lock and unlock only affect a specific queue, unless you specify `all`
ah okay thank you i wasnt sure if it just defaulted
so do i need to be in that queue channel and type unlock to unlock or can i just type "/unlock (queue name)" in another channel to unlock that said queue?
you will need to be in the channel, the command doesn't have a queue name argument
or in a linked channel
okay thanks!
<@748423487571492925>
Sban pls?
Huh? What?
Does /resetstats all wipe out all the bot info for the server, or only the player stats for all?
only player stats
kk ty
how do I make a leaderboard of the mmr on the server to list highest mmr on top and whatnot and update itself
You can set what options show on the leaderboard
And it updates automatically
but where? can I make a channel just for teh leaderboard?
like what command do I use
i got it nvm
se puede hacer que al momento q la party se una a la queue les de un rol?
`/autoroles ingame set`
Hello <@145305657237700608> 
Is it possible to add voting menu that will start after map veto?
And I need that Team 1 always vote first in new voting menu (planning to add side pick)
all custom voting menus happen after map bans, gamemode selection, and map selection
and Team 1 will start first,right?
if you set the vote as per_team yes
i have strange bug with leaderboard
any way to fix?
oh... all leaderboards look like that
i see the bug, will fix
why cant i change the outcome of the game?
it says interaction failed
is bot down?
<@145305657237700608>
Nvm its working
how do you reset elo
`/resetstats`
this is now fixed
say if i wanted to change the text to something else how would I go about that
currently not supported, unless you are talking about translations to other languages
oh I thought u could cause I saw this ss
oh thats /map add
different voting menu
<@145305657237700608> is it possible if u can come in my server an put the leaderboard up? idk how to get it
wdym
is there a command to give elo
`/add mmr`
Is there any way to make that players with specified roles always become captains?
And if no players with role in lobby, 2 highest rated players become captains
like for the pro city q
thing
that is not a thing currently
`/leaderboard`
is there a way to have it in a certain channel
oh, it would be great addition
you can just type it in a different channel
so we can give roles to streamers and they are always captains
sure i can add that
it would be nice, also add like method priority
so 1st priority - roles
2nd priority - 2 highest rated
or 1st priority - roles
2nd priority - captains pick
my idea was just specify a captain role in `/captains`
when selecting captains, the bot prioritizes people with the role, but if there aren't enough with the role then everyone is viable for the second other captain slots
so all the captain selection modes would still work
Looks like the "In Queue" breaks when someone joins and leaves, it doesn't go back to 0. It stays at 1
hmm seems to work fine for me, maybe its just delayed?
ohh you mean the new thing
channel names are only updated every 5 minutes
blame the discord API LOL, 2 edits per 10 minutes
Oh damn okay lol
it will update, just takes time
Hm I think I'm doing something wrong - the vc channel isn't updating with how many players are in game
have the numbers updated since you set them?
no not yet
I just took the screenshot
i mean like has anyone joined queue since then
yes, when I set those commands, those players were still in waiting room
so the q popped around 9:52?
hmm looks like it didnt try to rename
oh the asc+ q popped and it updated
thank you i'll keep my eye out on the other one
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
For some reason, our other queues (named the same) when I switched to monthly, didn't carry over the stats of the EU/SEA queues and haven't been updating the leaderboard with their wins as far as I can tell
could be my side, going to watch to confirm more
maybe there is something I messed up nvrm, I'll figure it out or if not bring back evidence of it happening
that would be very strange if new stats weren‚Äôt counting
i would assume it was an issue with settings changing mid match, any old match would use the old settings
Just had a weird bug
we subbed someone in, everyone joined VC, but the match didn't start
ughhhh
it‚Äôs cuz of the change to how the players are counted in VC
the list of player ids is created once and reused, so the substituted person isn‚Äôt included
easy fix though
üôè so any subbing is broken rn?
you would need the person to join the voice channel after subbing
or sub after everyone joins
so yea not great
ah okay
will let folks know
actually
i can reload that portion of the bot
one second
thank you üôÇ
ok, technically should be fixed
thank you!
<@133022759159726081> ^
although its very hard for me to test
if the change was reloaded
it's okay, if we do another sub tonight i'll confirm for you
thank you for all of your help you're a real one
can someone join a voice channel to test real quick
nvm, confirmed it works
fix one bug, cause another, painful cycle
The ingame has been at 10 for over 30 minutes
hmmmm
i‚Äôll have to check if it‚Äôs set to refresh when a match ends
i have a feeling not
might only refresh when a match starts
Did you ping me <@145305657237700608>? Or was that a while ago
was a while ago for this^ i subbed you in
all g now
Ah gotcha
Idk why I only just got the notification
> bot isn't moving ppl into channels randomly
> dc's everyone after teams + map is picked
report from tarik
^ im having the same issue now
Bot are not putting queue as a last message in channel + not moving people in voice channels
<@145305657237700608> Can u make `/need` visible to only the user and can be dismissed
It crowds the channel
same here
Let <@145305657237700608> wake up
Haha then he will save us as always
Ye I can‚Äôt do anything so just gotta wait for him
I assume it will be a few hours but no promises
np, he's always helping us, he needs to have some breaks and we let him his time cause he deserve it üòå
you could‚Äôve restarted bot probably
So, for solve that issue...?
Me too, not working
strange that these two issues happened at the same time
Same here, bot not moving people + queue message is not resending into queue channel
It looks like this
send a message, still?
Still like this
Oh nvm it worked from 2nd try
Thanks!
strange issue though
And voice chat is fixed as well? Can't test it rn
yea i tried and it was fine
Got it, thanks!
It‚Äôs working for me now. I didn‚Äôt change nothing üòÇ
yep, restarting the bot fixed it
i dont think that makes sense,  the whole point of `/need` is that its public for everyone to see
if it was only visible to the person who sent it, they probably already know how many are needed
how does the `balanced` option pick captains ?
itll pick two captains who are relatively close in MMR
is it possible to set the win/lose mmr amount based on the current role/mmr of the player ? So for example `Rookies` lose less mmr for a game lost then say a `Master` would.
does /clearqueue deletes the queue config?
not currently, mmr change is not role specific, that can be added though
no, clearqueue just removes all players from queue
okay ty
ive got a running queue, is there any way to reset the leaderboard without ending the queue?
`/resetstats` all or mmr
or just change the queue name
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
okay ty
the predictions in my queue are not working i did the /prediction channel command but the predictions aren't popping up in that channel and when you try and use /predict it says predictions are disabled
`/predictions toggle `
thank you
I am trynna bvuy 5 creds
for 5$
from India
<@145305657237700608>
having issues can ya halp
sure whats up
you can DM if u want
My bad, things seemed to be working fine for us again so I ended up not restarting
np, seems like nothing crucial wasn't working, just some annoyance
lol, so i enabled `/test` mode and joined the queue several times to trigger a game to be started and Im getting DMs from the bot saying im banned from queueing ?
i got a message for each time i queued
you get autobanned if you dont join the voice channel when a match starts
ok, it seemed like it didnt even give me much time to join anything
i think its 10 seconds
just unban yourself `/player unban`
no way to change to allow for more time for players to join a voice channel, i mean 10 seconds seems a little low.
its for testing
oh i see
thanks i was like holy cow
yea that would be wild, its 5 mins by default, change with `/lobbychannel timer`
thanks that helps
the bot is very feature rich, appreciate the hard work you've put into it
how do i set the initial mmr to start everyone at ?
`/startingmmr set`
thats what i figured, but im confused by the `role` option
So if you have a default role that everyone has for example a role called player
you would do ./starting mmr set @player 1000
just use the @ everyone role
for everyone
or that ^^
gotcha
thats what the bot by defualt
does by default*
so i did the `/startingmmr set ...` and used a custom role and set it at `100` then I did a `/resetstats all` and then i checked with `/stats` and it still shows my starting mmr at `1000` ?
nvm, i figured it out
had to do it for `@everyone` as you suggested
yea the bot has that role with a starting mmr of 1000
you need to override it or delete it
gotcha
when i try to start a queue it says "The application did not respond"
make sure the bot has permissions for the channel
i can see it did not have perms to send anything
yeah it was a role problem thanks :)
<@145305657237700608> Anyway i can get all player stats in One Go?
im assuming that when in `test mode` that the `captains selection` menu is only there because of test mode ? Like when not testing it should do what you specify for `/captains selection [type]` ?
no test mode shouldnt affect that
hmm ok
oh i see, i needed to do `/teamselection`
Recently the server I use the bot in had an issue where the bot acknowledged that the game happened and was completed but didnt update the mmr for everyone involved. I can send some screenshots if necessary I'm not sure if it was just a weird bug or if I did something wrong?
these two games were back to back but you can see that some of the players mmr is not what it should be like Noodles is at 1419 gets +24 for winning but goes to 1473 and then Owen doesn't lose any mmr from the second game despite losing
need some help with this
bot doesnt have permissions to create a channel
could you verify the MMRs on the leaderboard? it might just be a weird visual thing if they joined queue before their MMR was delegated
the mmr's were wrong on the leaderboard
they were consistent with the end of the second game but not at the number they should've been
I'm not sure how to recreate the issue for you so I can explain it better cause we basically just queued up the game ended but the mmr got changed incorrectly or not at all
could u give me Noodle's ID
i can check their history and see if the MMR lines up
this has been resolved, not a bug, just a match was reverted after the fact so it looks confusing in chat üòÑ
Very helpful thank you
how Do I remove a role for the game I accidentally set
whenever someone joins the queue it makes them pick a role and i dont want that
`/roles`
I tried that üò¶
what did you try
https://gyazo.com/70c71a422d958896e35d3b1c94ff8846
it looks stupid lmaoo
I did /roles
dont provide any roles
just `/roles `
it said it was invalid
when i tried that
ill go try it again
nvm I see what you meant
Thank you
does 0/2 mean only 2 people can join the queue
how would I fix that if thats the case üôÇ
yes `/teamsize`
is the individual queue the one that gives you the option to pick captains at the end?
for queue types
okay ty
if we chose to have mmr shown in nickname, how does that work with multiple queues that have different stats for each queue ?
it will be the most recent queue, or you can specify `/ratinginname queuenames`
but i am correct in saying that mmr is not a global number but is indeed tied to the queue so you could have different mmr's ?
correct
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
ok, so my setup will not work when setting up mmr restricted queues ... ü§î
wdym
well actually, i could do it based on roles since i have auto roles setup
well actually
so the role is based on mmr also, and that can change depending on the queue
but the idea was to have say 2 different lobbies one for lower skilled players and one for higher skilled players. but the higher skilled players wont be able to get into the queue without being able to earn more mmr in that same queue
not sure how that works
do you offer premium support, like i can pay you to help me get things setup and configured the way i want it ?
like hands on
i dont mind helping, with setting up multiple queues you need to consider if you want the leaderboards to be shared
i would like them to be shared, but i understand that the queue names need to match, but I also want the queues to still behave differently ... overall i would like a single mmr rating
Okay, then what about the queues do you want to behave differently
if you mean the queue configuration, that is independent per channel
for example the mmr restrictions, different maps, different modes, different voting settings for example.
yup, that is all separate per queue
the queues have different settings, but share the leaderboard
oh nice, so literally only the stats are tied to the name
awesome that helps me a ton
thanks
btw, i think there might be a bug in `/info` .. it wont let you traverse forward by a single page, but going to last page, and traversing backwards by a single page works.
there was an issue with displaying the Balanced captain selection mode in /info, itll be fixed when i update next though
is there a way to disable the DMs when roles are added or removed due to mmr thresholds ?
no not currently
<@145305657237700608> can i have 2 different staff channels for 2 different queue's?
yea, there is an optional `serverwide` argument
is there a way to change the timer or even disable the `auto pick` for team selections ?
Thanks
`/timer votes`
<@145305657237700608> Where to enable `serverwide`?
you can make it whatever you want, just note that the bot might cancel the match if it needs to restart and doesn't want to keep waiting
wrong command, it `/staffchannel`
ahhhh ok ok ,mb
<@145305657237700608> can premium be setup on a recuring subscription or do i need to set a reminder every 30 days ?
The auto forcestart vote does not seem to be showing up, despite having forcestartsize conditions set up.  Any guess why the forcestart vote may not be appearing for a Matchmaking queue?
hmm not sure why it says `anonymous user` ... but i donated üòâ
appreciate it! probably didnt select your discord name in the top, oh well
let me check
which server and channel
Sent via DM
i set the stats type to `Image` and it still showing the embed ?
itll always show an embed
doesn't look like an image tho ? Maybe I expected something different
thats a leaderboard config
thats an image
its an image embedded in an embed
gotcha
but also there is no text config for /stats
Is there a way for players to be able to see people in game channels?
like discord members who arent actively in the game just be able to view the voice channels, not join.
if you change the view channels permission for @ everyone, that should handle it
for the category
can you end a specific queue?
a channel can only have 0 or 1 queues, the old message is just the result of loading a config or something
you can just delete it
ok bet
<@145305657237700608> Idk if ur still available
but I could use ur help
so my teams are set to 8 players total I have 8 people but the match wont start
bot missing perms
how do i fix that
I gave it admin perms
admin perms will fix it
ill try again
wait which queue allows you to pick captains again
at the end
PUGS
or matchmaking
can you make captains random
`/captains selection`
<@145305657237700608> how to remove a player from lb?
Is there any way to start team selection at a specific time? (rather than when lobby is full)
so I think that `map bans` should be based on the Map/Mode combined (*If the mode exists*) vs just banning the Map itself.
in my setup I have the same Map that has several different modes
if a leaderboard is configured to edit only by staff, what exactly does that mean ?
like who can use the buttons on the leaderboard I assume ? Will this also disable switching the type of leaderboard shown via the dropdown ?
reset their stats
exactly
thanks
thnx man
is there a way to "initialize" all players with their initial mmr based on a given role ?
only via `/startingmmr`
is there a way to have an auto role setup based on how many games the player has played ?
not currently, although its on the planned-features https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/954499196629692486/1039664466226323462
sounds good
with the name format, is it always appended ? can it be prepended to the nickname ?
not currently, good to add to planned features though
And the bot can count kills and deaths, according to screenshots?
no, the bot has no way of doing that
Is it possible to add it somehow in the future?
not sure if i missed a reply on this one
probably not, it would have to be manually inputted
no not really, matches start when the queue fills
im not sure why you wouldnt want that
the mmr behind the name dont refresh after a win/lose
why?
Sorry - I should really give some context. Say I'm hosting a 10man for a particular time but want the available players to join queue similar to a 'check-in' status. Sure, I can start early or late, but was just curious if it could run on scheduled time.
any info, seems to work fine
you can schedule the queue to unlock at a certain time, maybe that?
I'll try it out, thanks
Oh I did have one other thing - is there a way to set up so teams are autoforced into voice channels before the map ban phase?
not currently, everyone is moved after all setup finished
but maybe that could be an optional argument for `/voicechannels`
can you create a channel on your server and have a description of each command there, what does it do?
could u give an example
well, for example 
/set mmr is a command so that administrators can set a certain mmr to players
right so whats the suggestion with it?
you can view all commands on  the docs
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/
is the leaderboard bugged? it didnt reset but its just plain blank when we type /leaderboard queue_name
dont type the queue_name, you have monthly set up and currently it won't show the correct data
oh, so does it reset monthly or depends on what i set it to?
which server is this
Hey <@145305657237700608> can I have 2 queues sharing mmr but not mixing player from one to other?
wdym mixing player from one to other
Like let‚Äôs say I have queue 1 and queue 2
I want if someone queues in 1 to not play with someone queueing on 2
oh, yea separate queues are different players
Yeah but do they share mmr?
if the queues have the same name, yes
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
So if I setup another queue but matching name
They will share mmr?
I understand that yes
Okay thank you so much!
Is this actually setting the IGN or just a broken feedback message?
are u using a different language? but yes it worked, just the message isnt right
Nope, should be on English
my server for valo 10 mans
ah, right
yea it‚Äôs messed up for showing the new ign, but it still updates
i‚Äôll fix that
why does it say the match has been canceled when i use /outcome selectwinner ?
the match probably didnt start
it put us in the VC Team chats ?
what are you trying exactly
like we went through the whole ban/voting and everything, then when i do `/outcome selectwinner [game #] [team #]` it says its been canceled ? ... im using the #'s that on the queue channels that the bot created after the game started ... is that not correct ?
you have vote for result disabled
like we selected the teams and everything, it created the team VC's and moved us to them, we played our games, and when i tried to do the `/outcome` command thats what i get
ill admit the description is currently misleading
vote for result disabled = no winners
wait what
i thought that meant that the players got to vote who won or something
the purpose of the option is if you dont care about winners it skips the whole thing
ok, so how can i go back and try and report that game ? is that possible ?
üò¨ no the match isnt saved at all
damn ok so i need to make `/voteforresult True` correct ?
then i'll be able to use the `/outcome ...` command
is there a way to make the created channels at least visible by `@everyone` ?
my players like to see that the games are active
yea you can modify the category perms
oh ok
well, my perms already has the specific role that i want set to `view channels` set to `True`, it isn't `@everyone` though .. but when the bot created the channels they was not visible to the players
yea, currently the bot only copies over the @ everyone perms
gotcha, I guess I can set it up that way
let me work on that rn
lmao i was just about the ask the same thing
it seems to be working on my beta bot, so im not too sure what went wrong last time
anyone wanna invite the beta bot and try it <a:TE_monkaSTEER:797886659039199252>
i might tomorrow
is it possible to have the created VC's show up *under* any manually created VC's ... like right now when the bot creates VCs it pushes my VCs to the bottom
might wanna make a separate queue category
im just trying to figure out the default permissions
most people don't want @ everyone to be able to send messages in the created channel, but if I disable that perm, then you can't override it
yea i dont want them to send messages, simply want them to see the created VCs so that people can see there are active games going on
should they see the text channels?
not necessary in my case, but as long as they can't interact with voting or send messages or anything then i guess it wouldnt hurt
annoying that you cant have separate view channel perms for voice/text
visible VCs are most important in my case
right
i think hiding text channel is better
otherwise its confusing to know which is yours
yea i agree
ill probably do this:

Text Channels:
    - inherit perms for category
    - @ everyone has view_channel perms denied
Voice Channels:
    - inherit perms for category
    - @ everyone has connect perms denied

so for voice channels, you can toggle if people see them or not via the category perms
but for text, people cant see them
sounds reasonable & sane
telling you man, make me core dev üòâ
so now its showing this
i really dont want this, just want to report the game winner via command manually .. is that possible ?
currently not supported
probably can extend the `voteforresults` command so it has 3 options instead of just 2
but also games shouldnt need staff to resolve them
yea i mean in my case it might make sense, what happens if there is a dispute in the votes ?
games can;t end in a tie for me
its a majority vote by default
split vote is pretty uncommon cuz there is usually an actual winner, and they are just holding the match hostage
just ban them
yea i get it but sometimes its possible that a team will claim that the other team should had been disqualified for x,y,z ... and maybe that team thinks they shouldn;t be disqualified and there for the teams just vote for themselves as winner. which then becomes a dispute that must be handled by staff
well in that case, no team got majority so it sits at a tied vote
so you would need staff to resolve
and then both teams will get MMR ? Or will MMR not be issued until Staff resolves ?
if the vote is tied, then it will just sit until staff resolves or someone switches vote
for (by default) there is a 3 hour timer that will auto resolve
`/timer matchcleanup`
ok, so something weird, I was in queue for a game, but after the game started it like removed me from the queue or something ...
but like they have full teams now though
wdym, so you were in a queue
and what happened
idk, it was like the game started but it didn't include me in the game ... maybe im tripping .. i'll keep an eye on it next time
so you were in queue, a match started without you, but you also got kicked from queue?
idk, i'll see whats up next match .. they started a game and I could had swore I was in the queue but apparently i wasn't or some reason I was excluded from the match and someone else took my place
lol alright
this is PUGs, not matchmaking right
page 2
yup PUGs
ok thats what i want i assume
yea probably
Also, can you explain to me what a lobby is ? And how multiple lobbies could be useful ?
kinda dumb feature from a long time ago
say you have 3v3, and you set number of lobbies to 2, the queue size will be 12
and once 12 queue up, itll create two 3v3s
split as fairly as possible
oh, yea i dont need that
its useful if you are doing like tryouts
right
We play Competitive CoD, I'm sure a lot of your users probably use NeatQueue for CoD 8s
yea the server with most players, Ranked League, is cod
3000 players and 9000 games
ignore the <#935731235790139422>, tried something out but it counted invalid players
how do you add mmr manually ?
for players that earn MVP points
oh `/set mmr`
actually, that will set it to a value
smart to use this for cod 8s and money 8s
`/add`
especially since he added anon queue
that was like a year ago !
oh ig tarik meant they just enabled it then lmao. i was watching and he mentioned anon
yeeee
has this been implemented yet?
tomorrow
sick. appreciate all that u do
lets say i used the pro city na queue config, can i get rid of captains buut keep the map voting?
`/teamselection`
i understand more about this bot thanks for the help
how to make the bot auto drag after queueing @here
`/lobbychannel`
Is there a way to limit who can do /stats or /leaderbord and which channel can they do it?
Is there a settings where I give people role upon using the /register command? Please reply asap :)
And the bot can put the number of mmr in the player's nickname on the server
<@145305657237700608> Does LB automatically update?
the /rename command will not complete
your servers integration tab will let you manage perms for commands, and you can do /hidestats to hide.
no but you can give them a role when they get their initial mmr using autoroles
no you just refresh it
does it just say thinking
yes <@145305657237700608>
okas
It would be nice to have `serverwide` option on most *if not all* configuration commands
`/ratinginname`
For some reason it doesn't work
did you `/ratinginname toggle`?
I wrote it but it doesn't work equally
Is it possible to do this?
hard for me to tell what the bot is saying in response
but yes, it should work
it wont initialize the name updates until the player has queued for the first time or they `/register ...` .. correct ?
not if you specify queuenames, it will start updating everyone's nickname
yes, but it will be suffixed to the name, not prefixed `nickname [0]`
oh really ?
will it only affect those users with the specified role ?
no it will rename everyone
but in my case im using a single queue name to share stats across all queues so i dont need to specify any queuenames correct ?
right, but if you wanted everyone in the server to immediately show their rating in name, you could specify the queuenames
gotcha, i dont want to do that, Only ones that are active players
question
so if I wanted to have multiple diff queues
but all linked to same elo system
(3 queues)
What would the best way go about that be?
Ive been toying with a few things, but idk if im just missing something
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
in my case i have 3 queues all with the same name, and that makes them share the same leaderboard/mmr ... but you can configure the channels differently
<@917344499699679242>
<@145305657237700608> can you explain how the streaks work ?
smart. ty.
win streaks give you slightly more MMR, loss streaks make you lose slightly less MMR
how about placement streaks ?
formula is `(0.4 * (1.2**-num_played_games) + 1)` if your num_played_games is <= 10
ok, i think i want that disabled ... appreciate it
can be helpful, most games do some sort of placement multiplier
its been super helpful tbh
that and the queue time lock
how does tournaments work, do they share the same leaderboards based on queue names ? or is it a totally different system ?
yes same thing, you can use the queue name to seed the bracket based on current MMRs
will players signup as teams or individual players ?
currently its only teams, but you just have to make a team of 1 for individual
i need it to be 2 teams of 4 .. so yea i might have a play with that setup
i may have questions as I play around with it
trying to set up R6 10 mans and had gotta error code LMDCP
how many people were in the match?
i was just trying to text it myself does it have to be a full 10?
*test
for captain selection it breaks when its just 1 cuz you need at least 1 captain per team, need to fix that issue
you can use /test
and join many times
ok thank you
is it possible to get alltime stats?
for a player?
i created a tournament but its not showing the "signup buttons"
try /clearqueue ?
hi, i can't read the messages that your bot sends, any solution? <@145305657237700608>
maybe i'm thinking about this the wrong way. i created a new category and new channel `register` and sent the `/tournament create ...` command in that channel. I did `/clearqueue` in that same channel and says it was cleared, but no buttons still.

For me I want it to be separate from my other queues and have the tournament on a separate leaderboard.
it will be a separate leaderboard if you give it a different name
try creating the tournament again
i see an error saying it cant be found for some reason
the name i specify through `/tournament create ..` ? do i have to /setup a queue first ?
no itll create a "queue" from the tournament name
end the tournament first
hi, i can't read the messages that your bot sends, any solution? <@145305657237700608>
do you just not see any messages, or any error message ?
any, just the buttons
oh, its an issue with your Discord client
try force quiting and letting it update
<@145305657237700608> seems to be working now.
how can i restart the disc client? i can't find nothing
<@493723501023330304> you may have turned off embeds ?
ahhh true forgot thats an option
i'll check
got it
can a player only be in a single `party` at a time ?
so if a player tries to create/join a party, and is already in a party it should alert them and prompt them to leave their current party before joining a new party ?
also in the tournament queue embed `Teams0/16` ... missing a [space] after `Teams` üòâ
you can have any number of parties, and you can be in any number of parties, but you can only be in the tournament registration once
and oops, common issue after making everything translatable
would be cool to see a "Create Team/Party" button with the tournament queue.
what if the Party the user selects to queue for the tournament has more then the number of players per team allowed ? will it ask you who is participating ? or will it have you remove members or create a different party ?
im just thinking about the "edge cases" here
you can only join with a party that is the correct size
same with teamqueues
ok, thanks
i know i have a lot of questions, but your bot is very robust and I want to know everything I can possibly know because I am building everything around it now at this point.
totally fair, tournaments havent been used often either so they arent tested as much
yea im gonna test the hell out of it üòâ
i'll let you know my suggestions as we work through our hiccups
i can treat a tournament queue just like every other queue correct, as far as its configurations ?
yea everything is configurable the same
a tournament will not start unless its manually started correct ? Or once the queue size hits the number of teams it will start automatically ?
im just going to create some teams and test everything out
hmm so the tournaments is still a MMR based system
still always needs to be manually started
yes seeding is based on MMR
how do the leaderboards play out in a tournament, is it still players or teams ?
still players, but the bracket is more important
i guess for me it probably doesnt matter, because I will be deleting the tournament after its finished
the leaderboard is kinda just a side product that still exists
right
map bans per team, is that also per match ?
per team means that team 1 will ban, then team 2, etc
right and that happens every match ? Im assuming that after a winner of a match is determined a new match will be created for the next round correct ?
yea every match is individual
the way tournaments work, once both teams queue up, itll just start a match between them
so the order of the matches dont really matter, its just if the bracket has a match with you in it, it will let you queue for it
it would be cool for `team queues` to have their own ladder based on team wins ... i'd be really interested in that
https://prnt.sc/D88aiM8CN04r
how can we fix the prefix , we want it behind the username
o_o that should have been the default...
how can i change it
one sec
yes sir
https://prnt.sc/UuTkXF8bFE1O
EVERYTIME someone joins q they got new elo prefix
yea restarting
when adding it default to prefix, when removing it default to suffix, oops
but you can do `/ratinginname format`
you broke it .. lol
and then?
choose suffix
and what format?
Invalid command, try again?
Invalid command, try again?
whatever you want
default is - ($)
`$` is replaced with the players MMR
can i reset all names
for example my format is `[$]` and I chose `Suffix`
nothing change it üòÑ
yea you probs have to `/ratinginname removeallnicknames`
cuz it messed it all up
or the ones that are messed up have them manually change their nickname on your server and the bot will fix it
just restarted, should hopefully work now
now the elo is like that yasha 1340 but i want yasha (1340)
im confused
then for the format do `($)` and chose `Suffix`
yea you need the () then
What should I do to show the MMR Results. We already queued and played yet still the mmr is not showing up.
make sure the bot has perms for the leaderboard channel
<@145305657237700608>
Is it something with the bot or my server setting?
all mmr's suddenly became prefix
yea, my fault, i added the ability to make mmrs prefixed, but it became the default when renaming people
its been fixed, but anyone who got renamed is still messed up
you will need to `/ratinginname removeallnicknames` or manually delete their nicknames
Will that add nicknames again?
no, it will remove everyone's nickname, thats it
probably easier to just remove the people that got messed up
cant be that many
Uff ok
Hey, when players vote for captains, who will become captain for Team 1 and who will be captain for Team 2?
Is it random selection between 2 most voted players?
Team 1 will be the lower rated
lower mmr or lower votes?
got it,thanks
And what if 3 players have similar vote count, how captain will be chosen?
if its a tie, its just whoever is closer to the top of the vote
E.g.
Player 1 - 10 votes
Player 2 - 5 votes
Player 3 - 5 votes
1 and 2
you mean who closer to number 1 here?
im saying if there is a tie, then whoever is closer to 1, yes
and players randomly placed in this message, right?
so when its tie, its basically random
would be cool if we can change it
so if its tie, higher rated players is captain
meh, i think random is fine, since this vote doesn't involve MMR at all
or you can just put players in this message sorted by mmr
so when its a tie, it will select higher mmr player
also it will be useful just to know who is more skilled player when voting for captain when its sorted by mmr
so if new player is in lobby, he know that 2 highest players in capt pick is the highest mmr players in lobby
i can get on board with that
Hello,
I'm having a problem with my queues at the moment. I would love to have my voice channels (created by the bot) to be limited to a certain number of users (3 in my case). That's because at the moment I set channel restrictions enabled but the voice channels get created without any restrictions and any player of the same rank can actually join in the voice channels while the players of that queue are playing, and that's not what should happen.
you will need to modify the category permissions
if in the category perms, you say a role can join any voice channel, then yes the created channels will obey that
this is a new change, previously the bot didnt care about the category perms
But that's with the disabled permissions, or am i wrong?
what do the voice channel perms look like
cause at the moment it feels like there's no difference between enabled and disabled permissions, since it still takes category permissions
People with a certain role can see and text/speak in the voice channels
yea, so the created voice channels will follow that
yeah, but that's the actual problem. This way if I have 30 people with that role, they can all join the team voice channel created just for the 3 people i have in the queue
right?
right, so just disable the permission that specifically gives that role permissions
what do you mean? xD
im assuming you have a role that looks like this
for the category
yeah
but if i disable that, the players can't join the queue voice channel that gets created before choosing teams
dont disable, just put it in the middle
the bot grants explicit access for players
at least it should
nope, that voice channel is still locked
The fact is, in case of people crashing, they can never join the voice channels again anyway
That's why I'm saying enabled and disabled restrictions looks the same atm
Yesterday it was good with restrictions enabled, the only problem was that the "everyone" role had everything on ‚ùå , while they should have been just able to see the rooms
otherwise the best way would be just being able to manage the voice channels restrictions by ourselves if there's a way
you have something else blocking it then
that is why its copying from the category now
so what's the difference between enabled and disabled restrictions after today's update?
<@145305657237700608> Why can other people with same role as the queue role view and access queue channels?
it was not like that before
something from the bot's end?
<#919709100114346076>
<@145305657237700608> why sudden changes tho?
not really sudden, been talking about it for days
the bot is just obeying the permissions you have set
you were relying on the fact that the bot didnt care before, but your perms were not correctly set
the problem is that yesterday with the restrictions enabled the only problem was that nobody could see the voice channels apart from the people in the queue. Today if you have the restrictions active or deactivated, there is no difference, both modes take the permissions from the category..
thats the default discord behavior though, channels created in a category get the permissions of the category
Breh Nice, Blame it on me
just saying, you now have more control over how channels are created
Still the queue voice channel is impossible to join for me
no offense, yesterday by turning off the restrictions you could do the same things as today, but you could choose whether to make the voice channels private with team size. Today with active or deactivated restrictions nothing changes.
I understand the changes made with restriction channels off, but I don't understand why now with restriction channels enabled there are no changes.
it does change things though, for example, previously, you were unable to hide the voice channels completely for the @ everyone role since by default the bot did not touch that when creating voice channels
it should be a pretty minor change to get it working for you all
yesterday, with restriction on, voice channels were invisible for @everyone..
that was due to a temporary change with specifically copying that permission
now, it copies all the permissions
but a week ago, it was not possible
Unfortunately my English is bad, I try to explain myself better.
Yesterday, with restriction on, the bot created private voice channels only for players who had started the queue, and this was perfect, as it should be.
The problem was that no one else could see those channels, the only fix in my opinion was just to allow everyone to see those channels.
when the bot creates a channel, it gives explicit Connect, Speak, and View Channel permissions for the players
Now as you say the bot follows the permissions of the category, but following these permissions allows all those who have the role dedicated to that queue to join the voice channels, because they are no longer private for players who have joined the queue and are not they have the entry limit as they had yesterday.
A solution could be that the bot creates the voice channels with the input limit equal to the team size set in the queue.
you should be able to remove the permission that lets the role join the voice channel, no?
also the created voice channels will have a limit matching the number of players
if you dont have staff/spectator roles
you should be able to remove the permission that lets the role join the voice channel, no? ---> if i remove the permission people cant join at the first voice queue channel that the bot create for start the queue.
also the created voice channels will have a limit matching the number of players --> Today he creates them without limits
and if they crash they cant come back in the channels
the first voice channel explicitly gives all players connect permissions though
it doesnt
also
it does have a player limit
you have channel restrictions on?
if i put on or off nothing changes
channel restriction i mean
that is not true, having it enabled will grant explicit access
yesterday everything worked, as I wrote before. Today if I put restrictions channel on or off nothing changes
just turn them on and try
you wont see player limits due to having staff roles like I said before
I have already tried at least 10 times
Man I'm not stupid üòÑ , I tried with players without staff permission
no, if you have a staff role added, there will never be a channel limit
otherwise they can't join the voice channel
you have staff roles added
do you mean in the category?
or do you mean if I have staff roles?
you have `/staffrole`s
yes i have but i tested it with players and they couldnt see any limits in the channel
^^^^^^^^^
*never*
So should we remove all roles from /staffroles to make it work or what?
no staffroles just changes the limit
Then why my players can't see the limits? XD
if they don't have the staffrole
brother
idk how else to put it lol
<@145305657237700608> can u put user limit to vc's bot creates as a team
and lock them at 5
yes that is the default behavior
except for the comment above
that isn't locking
how do i lock>?
wdym
when the bot is makiong VC's for teams
it is not locking
and due to the category perms
other people with the same role are able to join
its creating a mess
2) have you updated the perms?
dont get it
what perms do i need to update specifically>
since you have a staff role added, the bot does not add a user limit to channels
cuz how would the staff member join
connect
Then how should we have mods that moderate those queues if no one has that staffrole?
i can disable connect? will the players in queue be able to connect?
I was taking that staffrole as something essential
staff should over ride right?
no, cuz the `/staffrole` does not require any special discord perms
so they cant join special voice channels
but if i set category perms
and give overrides to the staff role
they will connect to vc?
bcoz category perms will be inherited
all you need to do is this
- goto the category, disable Connect for @ everyone, or whatever your special queue role is
created channels will copy the category perms, but override for the players
AHH UNDERSTOOD
Thanks

np, best of luck
how do i put?
`/channel restrictions`
its on by default
now it doesnt really make sense cuz it copies
i guess I can update it so it just gives @ everyone Connect, Speak, View, and Send messages perms
Ok i'll do tests tomorrow, but I think it should work like this
Thanks for your help, it just wasn't clear to me this whole staffrole thing
overall the staff role shouldnt matter, since the only people that should  get perms for the channel are the players
the channel limit is (should be) basically irrelevant
yeah that's true, then what's the point of that staffrole command if I can still manage queues by the /staffchannel set command? that's what i don't get it
I understood that command as: you can manage queues if something goes wrong or if you have to manually assign winners
staff role gives you perms to use all NeatQueue commands, as well as modify outcomes
even if someone can see the staff channel, they need the staff role to use the buttons
So if you want someone to have full control over the bot, either you can give them the `manage_channels` perm, or give them the staff role
is this good to go?
i already voted
if you retry it should work
is there a way to ping the discord when a certain number of people join the queue like when 7 people get in the queue it pings everyone and says we need 3 more
you can setup `/autoping` to do that, but it wont say how many are needed
`/need` does  that, but its not automatic
sounds good thanks
Is there a command to schedule when the queue will be available to join? Like the queue doesn't accept people till 6pm and then keeps going till like 6am.
`/lock` and `/unlock`
manual im assuming then
you can schedule the time, make sure to specify `auto_lock`
oh ok
is there a way to make peoples nicknames what they register as?
no not currently
is there a way to increase how long the captains have to pick players
is it just the same as the menu voting time
yea its just the same
`/timer votes`
Hey I was wondering if someone could help me with the initial setup
how do I go about removing a lock time set
just /unlock?
have u tried `/setup`?
uhhhhhhhh
one sec
Yeah so after I do the setup and everything 

1. Do I have to start a new queue once one is filled up

2. I think I have it so it'll make its own channel but I'm not sure. Is there a way to test it without making the discord public
1) no
2) yes do `/test`
okay tyty, idk if you guys have a config for Call of Duty stuff, but I have one I just made
This bot is amazing btw, it has everything
1 final question, how do I make it so this is auto enabled
`/mmr change allow_disable allow_disable:False `
Thank you!
anything on this
not gonna lie, i dont think you can
i also dont remember why auto_lock is an optional argument
okay
lets say I wanted to extend queue another hour or 2 past lock time
whats the best strat for that
for now you will just have to manually unlock it
i need to add a way to disable the auto lock
ah thats why auto_lock is there
ill just make it so if you retype the command with auto_lock False, then it will cancel
ah kk
tyyy
does this mean anythin' ?
https://getrekt.cc/TBOq05.png
adding roles, don't have it required or teams set by role
but it gave me that message
oh it changed my queue size
https://getrekt.cc/5krHhO.png
fixed by specifying false instead of omitting that Boolean
Hey, is there any way of showing the number of players in queue but hiding the names?
yes /anonymousqueue mode:Enabled
but that also hides the number of players right?
kinda shows up like this
https://getrekt.cc/C1cxmg.png
follow up to this, are roles server wide? i.e. work in multiple queues
what command is that?
<@145305657237700608> Why does NQ create so many q messages ?
its cluttering
Hey how does the Most Daily PLayers work?
does it track last 30 days?
para meternos en el top de Mas players
let me know when you are up NeatZ
It‚Äôs daily
Then its weird
My server has far more daily players that all of the ones taht are on the top
I will check if it pops up sometime
it has like 235 players in 4 or 5 days
weird
yes but you just have to set them up (as staff) in each queue
sometimes it happens with like one stale message but it shouldn‚Äôt be very often
it increments your daily player count when someone clicks queue for the first time
maybe this is a dumb counter though
if people would wanna see how many unique people clicked queue, instead of how many new people
its happens often üò¶
I mean, daily for me it is more like
matches that have happened today
Or unique players that have had a match today
The other one feels more like a All time Players
if you feel me
yea, i think unique players makes more sense
But well I think making it into the charts on day 2 feels pretty amazing
Kinda crazy
ignore the total player counts
some of those servers are old and the player were counted different
but i fixed it for today
I think i have it figured out, I added a new voting menu and I want basically all players to vote on it, but only be able to vote once and not be able to change their vote. My team selection is based on captain picks.

This is how I created the voting menu:
`/votingmenu add title:Allow Snipers options:Yes,No key:Allow Snipers team_voting:All Teams show_numbers:True number_of_votes:1 eligible_voters:All`
currently you can‚Äôt restrict them from changing votes
but yea looks good
ok thanks
does this vote finalize after all players have voted ? so it'll wait till all players have submitted a vote ? Is there a timeout for this if a player does not vote ?
it has the normal voting length
but it‚Äôll end if a vote gets majority
what happens if the votes are tied ?
have to wait for the timer to end
right, but when it ends, how will it choose a result ?
what is the default for "The average MMR change for wins and losses."
I think it is set to 50
the current default is 25
it would just be the one closer to the top
ok thanks
thanks
oops my bad sorry
np, it used to be 50 so maybe thats why
i changed it a few months ago
ah, okay dope
<@145305657237700608> if you do Best of 3 or Best of 5 is there a way to report each map or is it just the series
nah its just the series
The matchmaking change and the leaderboard are amazing changes BtW
thanks!
I guess this is intended + I have not tried to do anything wrong to it but
The api get can be called from any computer and will work
I have not tried to post
Just to not mess around with things
Like I got the CSV for my server by just calling the api from an api tester
thats fine, a decent amount of the API endpoints have no authorization, they all have rate limits though
the endpoints that let you interact with your server are behind authorization though, and require your auth token to be linked to a staff account
Oh yeah I saw the endpoint in the docu
It is just that I wanted to know all the games that were played on the server and could not find it so I just pulled the csv
which endpoint are we talking about
Like the api
yea which one
I‚Äôm the docu is there a section that explain how to set up and use the api is there not?
but theres a few endpoints, which did u use
idk, the mmr behind the name dont update after a match
Is there a way to turn off the temp channel creation that happens during rematches?
It tends to be a repeated source of confusion for users
no, but when you start a rematch it would block all the people in queue from playing
idk, i guess i can just make it follow the tempchannels setting
Got it.  Thought that might be the case
Would be nice to disable it if possible
have the option, i mean
yea i guess doesn't hurt to make it follow the setting, tempchannels off isnt a great thing to have usually
it only works in small servers
The problem we found with temp channels was that it gets confusing when people get yanked out of the larger lobby
expecially in 1v1s
it makes sense in your case cuz you don't have team setup, or voice channels
in 1v1s folks generally like to communicate together.  So temp channel would work if the two teams could both be brought to the same temp channel
tempchannel refers to the text channel
ah, got it. thought it also referred to voice.  realize now that is a separate config
yeah, the text channel is the issue in this case tho
when a user has `parties` and tries to join a standard queue based on Team Captain Picks it prompts them to select a party to join the queue, is there a way to disable that ?
and instead just make them join the queue solo
`/partyqueue Disabled`
thank you
<@145305657237700608>
Can I remove register requirement for a specific queue
yea just `/requireregister` None
how do i remove designated roles from a queue? I just read the doc and it says something about Omit but when i tried it my self it didn't work. Please help thx
are u talking about `/rolerequirement` ?
``/roles``
yea just type /role, dont select the optional argument
/roles *
alright ill give it a shot
thanks
whats the best way to run through a test for a Tournament  ?
just enable /test and join a bunch
but dont i have to join with a party ?
of the correct number of players
you will
either get another person or just make the teamsize 1
gotcha
if i delete a tournament will that literally remove all configuration for said tournament ?
i guess thats a dumb ass question
can i change the tournament size after its been created ?
you should just be able to do `/numberofteams`
but also if  you make a 128 team tournament, you can start with any number of teams
bug found
dont prefix the name with a $
oh ok
stupid mongo
can i use it in the title ?
at all
you think its ok to use pipes ? like `|`
yea, just the first char cant be $
dumb design by me, i stored the tournament name as a mongo field, which you cant really do
ill fix it at some point
hmm still can't seem to test
what did you name it
wait now its working,hang tight
im a little confused, does it not create VCs and voting menus and all the same as other queues ?
it should if its configured
also, how do a set the winner for the final round ?
wdym
yea idk, when i start a tournament its not creating any channels
oh nevermind, i see whats happening here
the queue text channel did throw an unexpected error though
yea so it only creates channels when the teams queue up
says you‚Äôre still trying with a $ prefixed name
oh idk
it just popped up again
oh i know
yea, it worked this time, though
it put that bad tournament name in your playerdata so it can‚Äôt save that to the database now lol
ok so im a little confused, if the seeding is based on mmr, but the tournament stats get deleted with the tournament then mmr would reset every tournament right ?
that‚Äôs why you would name the tournament the same as your normal queue
so it can pull stats from there
or in your normal queue, do /rename to copy the stats to a new name
i dont want to do that though really
i really want the 2 systems to work independently
then it wont know how to seed since the stats systems are seperate
but it would just randomly seed right ?
that would be ok i suppose
yea, i didnt imagine people would care about leaderboards in a tournament
cuz its just the bracket thats important
What about the tournament configurations ? Once a tournament concludes it basically ends the "queue" and then I would simply "create" a new tournament correct ? In this case all configuration would have to be setup again ? If so, I'd probably would want to keep a base configuration "code" to `/load ...` ? 

I dont care about a leaderboard, but your tournament system is basically another queue type which is very tightly coupled to your "queue system" which IMO tournament system probably should be its on implementation, possibly even a totally different bot entirely ... but thats just me
yea there is a super popular tournament bot, which is why im not too hung up on the tournament system
but yes, tournament matches hook right into the same pipeline that normal queues use
also yes, tournaments should be able to be loaded and saved
you basically can, it just would have the same name
but then i could use `/rename` to rename it, and `/teamsize`, `/numberofteams` ... and that should be all i need to change, all other configurations should remain the same basically
right, those things would work
currently changing the name wouldn't work, but thats an easy fix
once its fixed though, you can just load/save pretty easily
also im removing /rename in favor of a new command /migratestats
would you mind sharing the bot you know about for tournaments ? you can share it in private if you prefer. I've looked around and most seem to be overly complicated and I need something simple and clean. I really like your setup, just wish it was separate from the MMR system
sure just did, but you can decouple from the MMR system if you just turn off MMR for the tournament
im going to continue to play around with it and see if i cant get it to work for me.
another rub I have is that the created channels for the tournament is inheriting the staff roles for the other queues, for example I have separate staff that handles tournaments.
i mean i guess its not really a big deal
yea staff role is a server wide config, would be strange for it to be different imo
yea you right, just trying to think this through
Not sure if this is a right spot, but i'd just like to ask how the bot calculates how much mmr is lost or gained after a win / loss
and if that is changeable or not
you can change the base MMR chance and the MMR variance, there is a calculator on the docs
having issue with elo linked to role, it will not change from 5000 no matter how I set it
Ive deleted the role, tried others and still will not change
wdym, if the role is gone it will no longer be a starting mmr
check the /info, i think page 3
nono, so I have 2500 - 3499 elo being rank A right, and 3500+ Rank S
every time I try to set rank S to be 3500+ it goes to 5k
oh autoroles
what does /info show
How would i go about Disabling MMR Completely?
fixed it, my keyboard put 2 zeros on a number <:kekw:645440310503145496>
my bad
oops!
just set the mmr change to 0
thanks!
can u explain in simple terms üòÖ how the mmr change variance works and how it effects the Elo given out and taken from players? I think I kind of have an idea, but am not sure
hey <@145305657237700608> bot isn't put the queue message at the first place
any idea?
Is bugged i think cause the queue message is bugged again and in my case the temporary channels aren't inside of any category
just a weird bug
on the docs there is a calculator link, search for desmos
Ik I saw it, i still don‚Äôt understand how the variance effects the mmr tbh
its rocket science man
as the variance value increases, it decreases the output MMR variance
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to refresh roles after a reset
so everyone loses them?
or is that a manual thing
hmm it should do that automatically probably
but if you do `/autoroles set`, even if its the same config as before, it will recalculate everyone
so on reset
so when I go to adjust the autoroles
it says 0
like 0 players adjusted
do people still fit the criteria then?
I swear man
So would you generally recommend to have higher settings or lower than default?
i think the default is pretty good
but the calculator shows pretty well wht changing the value does
they do, im just going through carlbot and taking roles away from humans
easy work around <:kekw:645440310503145496>
if they still fit the criteria it wont remove the roles then
Im gonna be honest, the calculator confuses me a ton
But I‚Äôll just stick to default if that‚Äôs what u recommend to have the most skillfull and competitive settings
a 1100 MMR player beating a 1000 MMR player with an MMR change of 50, and variance of 1600 will gain 46 MMR
raise the variance value to 2400, and they would gain 47.6 instead
How many games are reset? I just have a limit of 50 games
it resets every 24 hours
Namely how many? At 00:00?
its at 00:00 UTC
everything resets
What time is it UTC now? So that I can orient myself
uhh i think 16:00
Ohhhh ok tysm
I have set the MMR Variance at default, what does that mean?
Sorry i am NOT a maths guy üò¶
default is 2400 iirc
I have an issue where using the Valorant config in <#1068605714098049054> we get no map bans option, it's just they pick 1 map and thats the map they play, /map voting is set to true and captains, and map selection is set to vote
did you modify the number of map bans?
i changed map selection to random rather than voting but it didnt change it
what does the /info say on page 4
I believe so, iirc i set it to 3 bans per team
will double check
Does anyone know how i add stats channels like these
when i try and do it i do /serverstat inqueue and put in the channel i want it to be and it says this then nothing happens
Question. I setup a que in a channel but I actually want it in another channel. Trying to figure out how to do this but not sure
did you join the queue after?
also does the bot have perms to edit that channel name
you can just `/save` the channel and `/load` the config in a new channel
config codes are globally shared
Thank you
I didn't actually start the que so I think I'm good anyways. Just gonna remake in correct channel.
i made sure it has perms and joined the queue and its did this
oh its a text channel
text channels are all lower case, with hypens instead of spaces
so In Queue: $ looks like in-queue-$
oh i need to make it a voice?
do i lock the vc myself ?
dont have to but i probably would
okay thank you for your help
save your config and post it here
OCKTQ
that code had each team do map bans
i changed it to random twice but it didnt do it
BECMG
new code
you have so many map bans that there is no map selection
if i sent it to 0 would it work?
like this
how can i disable map voting or rand selection ? I want to build my own voting menu for maps
remove all the maps
thanks
How do I setup my maps and modes?
<https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=maps>
Sheesh I've been reading all the documentation and still missed that. lol thanks
This bot is dope. Glad I found it
when i finally make videos, a video on maps and stuff would be good
I'm also working on some short clips highlighting features. I'll be sure to send them your way so that you can post them in some official capacity
So I've got just about everything I can think of setup (for now). I enabled test mode and que myself 4 times in a 2v2 que and it opens the text and voice channels for me but then just times me out. Is there a way I can get past that? I want to see the voting options and maps that I've setup, etc. Or is that not possible?
you have to join the voice channel
hello quick question: I‚Äôm the owner and the bot has perms and role above mine but won‚Äôt add my mmr to my name. Any reason?
it‚Äôs not possible for bots to nickname the server owner
ahhh unlucky
thank you tho!
you can only nickname people with less perms, nobody has more perms than the server owner
yea, a bit strange, no
Gotchu gotchu yea
it‚Äôs ok! hahah
I do join the VC but it still bans me
I'll try again
It worked that time idk but all good
hey yall, im typing in my ign with the tag but its still telling me my account is formatted incorrectly
<@145305657237700608> Dms When free yo
what did you input
Why hasn't the bot updated the games?
What?
idk what you mean
more context
I don't understand you, I'm just Russian and I communicate through a translator
Why didn't I update it?
<@145305657237700608>
it should've, ill just manually reset them
Well, as soon as you reset, let me know
done
Thank you
Hey!
I wanna ask question about /autoroles mmr set
I wanna make that all players that played in queue have this role.
So, i put lowest mmr to 0, highest to 10000 (so they wont lose it)
And when player finish his first match, he will get the role, right?
they would get the role immediately when they queue for the first time
so when player press "join queue" - he get role, right?
if its their first time queuing yes
when you click queue for the first time, you get your starting MMR
thanks for help!
when i reset mmr, roles will be deleted from users?
currently no, but if you modify the autoroles again, it will re calculate everyone
nice, thanks
Also, when limit per games resets?
0:00 UTC
<t:1676264400:R>
<@145305657237700608> is it possible for you to make an update for leaderboard? It would be nice if we can sort leaderboard, so i can check how players with "role" doing in leaderboard
wdym?
oh i see
hmmm im not sure how useful that is
Look for example
We have 2 hubs - open (for everyone) and pro (for top ranked players)
We want to let PRO players play in Open hub, but PRO players will have higher starting mmr so bot can balance teams properly
So PRO players, who played in Open hub, will occupy leaderboard and it will be hard for open players to find their correct place in leaderboard
Maybe you can make settings, that some roles do not appear in leaderboard at all
if you have a role requirement set, only people with the role will show on the leaderboard
But if I put role requirement, players with PRO HUB role cant join Open queue
Right now we have like this:
OPEN HUB - no role requirements, everyone on server can join
PRO HUB - PRO and TRIAL role can join
I can create new role for OPEN HUB, but then PRO and TRIAL cant play there
maybe you can create setting for leaderboard config, that will remove players with "role" from leaderboard
Is there a way to view the maps that I have already added?
/info page 5
<@145305657237700608> any thoughts on this?
<@145305657237700608> hoiiiii
what doe **(n/a)** mean?
yea i guess that could be added
ah, i guess those were subs?
Ahh Right
nah i see the issue
but yes its with subs
i hope it will be added soon üôÇ
<@145305657237700608> ayyo, whats "points?"
Please check ‚ù§Ô∏è
points are earned +100 for each match, theyre used in predictions
Ohh Okay
Can I edit an existing map/mode or do I have to just removed and the add as new
what's the correct formula to setup something similar to tarik's procity (queue system)?
you have to remove and re add
there is a config posted in <#1068605714098049054>
kotri posted it and they set up the bot in pro city
ahhh
thank you
Will a voice channel be created once 10 players have joined the queue?
or will I have to use the command /startfromvc
I wanna make it so when queue pops the players are required to join vc and talk out what maps they want for example. I already did /voicechannel mode required
yep that‚Äôs the right command
thank you
i appreciate the quick responses
whats the trick to reaction roles giving queue roles?
I can't seem to get it to set, I think you added that previously right?
yes, you can provide the queue role when you add the reaction role
is there anything for crosschecking a users registered name?
https://getrekt.cc/LzXwvk.png
just like this? I shoulda just tried it
tyty
yea just make sure the roles are the exact same names
got it all set, then realized I didn't set roles to be singular
any fast way to do this after the face or do I just have to add them all back again with that flag
<@145305657237700608>
Why is it showing the message again
Here it did not
Is there any setting?
Something like a sticky message or something????
Yo! <@145305657237700608>
I was wondering
I set my captain selection to highest mmr players to be
but usually the highest mmr player set to be the team 2 captain
is there any possible to change this setting?
like I want the highest mmr player to be the captain of team 1
And second highest player to be the cap of team 2
any commands to change?
and also seems like the /captains automute is not working for me
Idk is the permission problem
or the bot bugged
for example
the highest mmr player always 100% set to be the team 2 cap
so I was wonder if I can change
<a:vollSTEER:815816922179305492>
Hi, yesterday it was fine but now whenever a match is supposed to start only the text channel is made and it doesn't ping anyone (and no match result vote screen either)
i hope its due to /test :(
is it possible to give different permissions to a role for example i only want a certain role to only have access to cancel the queue and also ban people from the queue
the lower mmr of the captains gets first pick to be a bit more fair
yes I know
seems like a perms issue
lower mmr can pick one players
higher can pick 2
you can add a staff role, otherwise no you can‚Äôt get that much control of the perms
Yeah sorry, it was my mistake. thank you
so....No way to change the captain?
not currently
thanks boss man
<@145305657237700608> 
Could be cool feature - bot sends message in queue channel how many matches is ongoing
So it looks like:
1st message - queue
2nd message - matches ongoing
And bot always resend this 2 messages
How i can give permission for someone to see all voice channels?
you can give a /spectatorrole
I want them to see voice and text chats that bot created for match, but not be able to join them and write in them
And how to reset the mmr and statistics to a person who left the discord server?
Hi, i'm not sure if its the right channel to ask in, but whats the deal with /numberoflobbies? If I have a queue that normally starts when 10 players join, and I do "/numberoflobbies 2", will it require 20 players instead? (and start 2 different matches at the same time?)
you can modify the view channel permissions for the category then
iirc you can mention them still like `<@id>`
like this <@1313213213>
that is correct
it will split the lobbies based on the skill
Thanks, I understand its pretty niche compared to what‚Äôs available now, but what if the Matchmaking queue could start a match when the queue is X amount of players? (X being a number above 1 lobby size, obviously) /numberoflobbies is great as is, especially for smaller lobbies like 1v1, but I‚Äôd rather have an option to wait for extra people to come and have the bot put them in if its better for balance, instead of waiting for an amount of players _double_ the size of one lobby. I understand its very niche, since Matchmaking already waits for a set MMR range that widens over time, but It would eliminate a situation where the bot starts the game anyway because its taken too long
tl;dr option for Matchmaking to just wait for X amount of players (instead of the mmr range increasing OR waiting indefinitely) to start a match, X being above one lobby size. So If the queue hits X amount of players, it will just ignore the appropriate MMR range and make a match anyway
can you tell me how to do it? Im kinda noob in discord
Hey <@857633321064595466> can I remove the messages sent when the autoroles are being given
Anyway i can hide the MMR on the nick names? <@145305657237700608> ??

And only visible in LB and stats
i would say that seems pretty unnecessary, the new matchmaking system does basically the same thing, you can just config the settings the better match what you want
right click the category and hit edit channel
i know its very redundant, just shooting my shot üòÖ
example?
no not really, leaderboard and stats just reflect the discord user's name
ohhhhhhhhhh
I wanna do like this:
Players from OPEN queue can see only OPEN HUB matches
Players from PRO queue can see all ongoing matches
Is it possible?
Both queues in same category
you would need different categories
i just need to change this setting to "/", and they will see ongoing matches but cant join voice channels?
connect is not the same as view channel
No, why do you think that?
this setting, right?
they will see all new matches and cant join voice chat if they are not in that match
I took one look at the desmos calculator and said "mlosermmr and pwinnermmr must be multipliers!" in hindsight how did I even think of that
i guess the actual question now is, what does "loser_mmr" do in /mmr change set? Instead of losing whatever MMR you were supposed to lose, you always lose the amount set by "loser_mmr"?
yea it changes the base MMR for when you lose
still used in the calculation though
oh okay, thanks a lot
Any possibility to add map name to this voting menu?
probably not since its a custom voting menu, so its kinda not linked at all
sad üò¶
Ir should do it alone
It did on my server
Balancing feels very iffy
like balancing is just putting 1 high elo player w 4 more SUPER low elo players
and calculating that as balanced
is there anything we can do better w that?
balanced just means the teams average is as close as possible to fair
so that‚Äôs kinda the best we can get
Hi neat, can you check dms? thanks :)
the bot is having an error when pulling the mmr for one of my server members help please?
its saying unable to fetch user stats
however he is imputting his uplay correctly
Is there any way that I can set the bot up so that team captains are picked based on party captains? (Please reply to this message so I am pinged).
Where can I buy
https://www.neatqueue.com
<@145305657237700608> how do I include my serve name to <#935731235790139422>
Server*
you might be on it tomorrow
it‚Äôs automatic so we shall see
Ohhhh okai
anyone know how to add a line to the final queue message, where i can say something like "team 1 chooses side"?
Is there a way to close the queue and open it at another time?
Hello. Faced a problem that at input /test I receive an error.
Problem: Application not responding
can the bot see that channel?
you can do this as a message with:
/lobbydetails set message:
or with a vote: /votingmenu add
Hey can i have a ss where i can see how *lobby details* message looks like?
Ohhhhhhhh Ok Ok
So we're experiencing this
Last person can't join
i wonder what that means...
Ah I see
Just went offline xd
how to reset mmr for released players?
./resetstats player
writes an error because it is not on the server
which error
invalid user
you'll need to mention the user using their ID
`<@1312313123>` => <@3123123213>
I'll try now thanks
Give me tutorial please 


To have Lobby Details Message
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobbydetails-set
ü´Ç LY bo
has this been implemented?
Any ETA?
idk, i wanted to do this via a Modal Popup when you vote for winner, but currently modals don't support Dropdown menus
i guess could just be a normal message with a dropdown
ye ye, that'd work too
similar and attached to the winner message
can't only be there cuz that message is deleted when a winner is picked
but doesn't mean the MVP is picked
Hmm right
Have another message just below winner vote
or have the mvp option in the staff channel [staff access]
so we take mvp input from the players and manually add the MVP's
nah nothing will ever need manual input like that
its just gonna be attached to the winner message + the results message
so you can vote before and after a winner is picked
Ahh Awesome
when will the feature be out üëÄ
whenever im not busy, maybe this week
Ahh Awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks My G!!!
Hi there!! im setting de mmr for the matches...  how do i have to do if i want set the next:
- Win : 3 Points 
- lose: 0 Points
`/mmr change set amount:3 loser_mmr:0 static:True `
Hello hope everyone‚Äôs doing well. At the end of our 10 man, the wrong team was awarded the mmr. Is there any way to reverse this? Thanks
you mean people voted the wrong team? anyways you can modify results with /outcome
Oh perfect
Ima try it rn
Sorry where can I find the match number
I‚Äôm dumb
Found it
One last question sorry is there a way to check a said persons mmr? Thanks
either via the /leaderboard or /stats
Got it tysm!
is it possible to use /serverstats servername just to show stats from only specified queue?
also it doesnt rename channel, waiting for 6 minutes already
no there isnt queue specific stats like that
and has a match started since then?
i guess no
it only updates when a match is started
got it, thanks
you have the same description for both "games" and "ingame" stats
good catch, thx
Is there any way to make that new queue`s voice channels is higher than previous lobbys
currently its looking like this
and i want new channels appear on top of list
not currently, maybe that should be the default though
Speaking of which, how do you determine where the voice channels go when they're created?
Like if I want them to be underneath a channel in a certain category, how do I specify that?
you can specify the category via `/channel category`
the order is just default new channel order, which is at the bottom
what happens if you accidently delete the queue message ?
if you type in the channel it will come back
ok, that would had been nice to know, I just use the `/load ...` command and reloaded it from a save point
you can also just /clearqueue
gotcha
good to know
crap
now there are 2 queues in the same channel
how can i get rid of the one ?
<@145305657237700608>
delete the top message
can  you help me the bot is returning this error when multiple people try and register NeatQueue BOT  ‚Äî Today at 6:44 PM Error fetching your Rainbow 6 rating. Make sure the account is formatted correctly! Only you can see this ‚Ä¢ Dismiss message however they are imputting there name correctly
it works for some but not all of my server members
also sent an inv if needed im expecting that its needed because its doing the same thing with the mmr in the name for some people not all
what is their input and platform
`/register account:sckyo `
`/register account:lti2x `
`/register account: jaylo.-`
its wierd bc i could register with jaylo.- and it updated roles everything but he cant himself register it gives him the error
the other 2 cant register it gives them the error
`/register account:ClaspingWord255 `
https://r6stats.com/api/player-search/ClaspingWord255/pc
they dont have any stats
i just played with him
hes plat
im just saying, the API the bot uses doesn't have his stats tracked
so how does one fix that issue
bc my server members cant que if they dont register and they cant register
i have no clue really, thats just the best rainbow 6 API i found
<@917344499699679242> is the VC from a match older than 1.5 hours?
freshly created
happened 10 times today
did u check audit logs?
now created channels are not staying in assigned categories
the bot isnt even creating channels now for some games
might have just been cuz the match started before the bot fully restarted
would keep an eye on it
is it fully restarted now?
ill run a test
tabstats and tracker have eveyone that the current api doesnt
if they have a public API ill use it sure
i know tabstats has a dev program for just that
i think tracker has a public one too
hey im not sure if its a bug or im not looking correctly, but sometimes (very rare) players will randomly have their stats reset. I checked audit logs, neatq logs and cant see, that anyone manually reset the stats for given players. Is that a known bug or do you have any advise to figure out what happened or how to prevent this?
trying to figure this out myself atm and saw that if you reset someones stats it doesnt show up as an actual message, but as one only the person executing the command can see. That leaves so much room for abuse, cuz anyone with perms to commands can reset anyones stats without it showing up. And we need a lot of staff members in our server, bc we need to change teamsizes and other stuff often and want to always have someone online for queues. Just allowing someone to change teamsize without other commands isnt possible tho, so they will always have access to all the commands
the command would appear in the /logs
i can investigate more tomorrow if you wanna check things out
cuz if it‚Äôs not an issue with staff using commands, then it‚Äôs a major issue
it doesnt appear in my logs
well, i tested it and it showed up and then got deleted like 10 minutes later
im pretty sure it is an issue with staff using commands. The issue for me is, that somehow the last few days are somehow not appearing in logs
it skipped from commands someone used on 10th feb to the commands someone used like 20 minutes ago
everything in between isnt there
hmm that would be very strange cuz all commands should show in /logs and it‚Äôs not possible to delete them
thats why im confused
this is what it looks like and i can 100% say that commands have been used in that time
which server?
https://discord.gg/HV26V6zp
i see
i know why command logs are vanishing though
yeah why?
people cant queue
doesnt allow them to
./unlock
it didnt work
then idk
unlock is the correct fix
it didnt work
maybe you have a role requirement
to join queue
nah the greyed out button means they are disabled
right click the message and click Apps -> Toggle Buttons
maybe someone did that
okay i see
tysm
can u explain pls :3
well i think ik
its an issue with how server data is saved
recent change to save intermittently instead of after every command used
ill take a look tomorrow
k ty
also ill update the resetstats commands to not be hidden responses
at least then it will show in audit logs when the message is deleted
yeah that would help a lot tysm
Hey <@145305657237700608> 
On this screenshot you can see that new lobby is higher than old one
but now new lobby is lower than old one
how it works?
<@145305657237700608> how can i cancel a `/purge` command ...
u cant üòÑ
is there a hard limit set for how many msg's its gonna delete ?
nope
it'll literally delete *every* message in said channel ?
thats a feature you might want to set, should have some sort of hard limit, even if its a high number
also a command that can cancel the purge, should be as easy as batching out a number of messages to delete, and on every batch iteration it can check a DB value to see if a cancel has been requested and at that point you could break out of the loop.
maybe even add an optional `num_to_del` field
I think discord might have a hard limit ? The bot did not delete *All* messages
looks like the wrapper gives a 100 message limit
default
ok cool, thats good at least
Hi, i want to get premium in a new discord server, I invite the bot and purchase credits, but I can¬¥t get premium.
Is there any way to add message that shows what map will be played? I want this message to be sent right after map veto ends
the selected map shows up in the final  teams message
if you can purchase credits then the premium plans are on the same page, what are u seeing?
I see a message that I need to invite de bot, but is already invited
could you screenshot
also if you recently invited plz try again
Yeah, but this message is after my custom voting menu
I want it to look like this:
Map veto - message with map played - side peek (custom voting menu) - final team message
should work if you try again
I get the same message <@145305657237700608>
Hello. i dont know if this is the right channel to write my question. There is any config code for COD Competitive?
what server are you trying?
The discord server name?
so i did a `resetstats all` and the nicknames still reflect old mmr ?
im planning to refactor map bans/selection to reuse a single message and just keep editing it, so it will show the final maps picked in t here
yea its a bit weird rn since there isn't a direct connection between nicknames and specific queues
if you do a `/autoroles set` it will update all names, even if you dont change the config
thats not a command/sub command
oops `/autoroles mmr set`
used to be just autoroles set
and leave all options empty or am i supposed to add one ?
either add a temp one or just retype in one thats existing
i retyped one, but nicknames were not updated
whats the channel id
also ill add a command to just force refresh until i fix better
the channel i executed said command in ? `1072869246448717935`
from commands.mod.autoroles import AutoRoles
chn = client.get_channel(1072585015155752981)
queue = await NeatQueue.fetch(chn)
return await AutoRoles.recalculate_all_roles(queue)
whats the queue channel
`1072585015155752981`
it only modified 1 person?
lol ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
oh right thats not nicknames
how do you have ratinginnames set up
is it just the most recent queue
I only have 1 queue
well, 2 channels, but 1 leaderboard
LAN Pro City
yea it won't update until people queue again
cuz thats how your config is set, its just the most recent queue
i have a command I wrote on my bot that will allow me to just do it based on role
you don't have any credits in the server it seems
i'll just exec that right quick
hmm, so i was able to reset all names, but, the roles still remain
do they still meet the conditions
I buy $5 credits
Yo can see the image
what email did you use
you can DM me
any ETA when it will be done?
not currently
<@145305657237700608> any update on the tabstats or tracker api update?
could you link me an API
It‚Äôs something wrong
With the queue thing
It‚Äôs not auto refreshing
<@145305657237700608>
is there any problem with the bot? <@145305657237700608>
Yeah we have an issue in our channel
same
yea was adding more logs to help find this issue, restarting now
i appreciate the update u already made a ton, still I would love to be able to see the logs for commands complete. Do you have advice on how to fix this?
I can see if i can find it yea
Tabstats has a private api butbas the dev of a major bot you might get into the dev program and gain accses to there api here the contact link for tabstats where u can request accses to the api https://tabstats.com/contact
https://app.apitab.net/v1/auth/callback?code=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&state=RnVwZXh1cHBNQWdKUk9MM0lPTno0R05kdFFpZnZLWkI%3D
Thats the best link i got tho
the bot is having issue again?
Yes for me as well peluche
<@145305657237700608> it's throwing queues everywhere but the categories we have set
<@145305657237700608> how does mmr decay work specifically? I get that after a certain time the mmr starts decaying and i can configure the amount, but is it a one time thing or does it keep decaying? e.g. if i make it so mmr decay starts after 3 days and the amount is 10 mmr, how does that work
every 3 days they will decay 10 mmr
k ty
does the decay only happen if players dont play for the time or does it always happen
its 3 days of no games
perfect
<@145305657237700608>
WHAT should be my category perms, if i have my match channel being made under it?
We love making you reset the bot
<:kekw:645440310503145496>
Thank you neatz <:CB_catto_blush:418074330514325514>
some big underlying issue though
might be hitting the global rate limit ngl
Global rate limit?
yeee
For like amount of commands?
Or just amount of actions the bot does
ill have to check when it happens again
but the bot can only do 50 API things per second
Huh.
May have been on me, we just moved around 4000 players LOL
wdym moved
./autoroles mmr
Adjusted roles for like 4000ish. IDK if that would have caused anything
Didn't really think about it
no, its a global limit, servers have their own limits
Ah okay
so its kinda a combined issue if it an issue
<@145305657237700608> yeo
depends who you want to see channels
Only those who will play and A common role
common role should not be able to join/access any channels, only view them
<@145305657237700608>
<@748423487571492925> do u need help with roles?
<@145305657237700608>
the bot manages text channel perms, but you can manage voice
the bot will deny @ everyone "join" the voice channel
NeatZ 5525
Ahhh okai okai
Looks like youve been busy since tarik started using your bot for 10mans hahaha
very true, almost at 1,000 new servers in a month
crazy
Hey <@145305657237700608> 
Any way to get leaderboard fully copied to a sheet?
when i just copy, it pastes everything in 1 column, not too comfortable
player data is stored in nested json documents, so it will be a bit hard to flatten to a excel sheet
you'll need to use a json to csv converter
but it won't be pretty
only way i can use now is just copy every row from leaderboard one by one and manually format it so it looks like on site?
the leaderboard data shouldn't be too hard flatten out
its only nested 2-3 levels
i have 0 knowledge about it, maybe you can tell me how to do it or send youtube guide üôÇ
try https://www.convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm and see how far it gets you
<@145305657237700608> How do i stop this from changin
its a channel name with a queue
hmm currently /serverstats doesn't have a way to unmark a channel
you have to delete the channel, or switch it to a different channel
owww
/serverstats channel name players - shows how many unique players have queued on our server? And what is max for free users?
thanks
Was adding maps and changing the map voting stuff and it reset the leaderboard
Is that meant to happen and is there anyways to get the leaderboard back?
maybe you changed the name? maps are unrelated to the leaderboard
is it possible to remove all these buttoms except one?
for example  remove balanced random ecc and use only the captains buttom
yes, `/teamselection`
Ok thanks
can you set the map choice to random instead of picks
`/map selection`
found it thank you
asked 5 seconds before i found it üò∫
i changed map selection to random but it's still having us choose
whats ur config /save
WZVFY
sorry for late response i was in game
its cuz you dont have a map selection
you only have map bans
oh ok
map selection comes after map bans, but you ban until 1 map so its just auto selected
gotcha so if i turn off bans then we'll get random
thank you
hi! i got this error code üò¶
bot missing perms
although, you shouldn‚Äôt be seeing an error code for missing perms
unable to send the prediction message in the predictions channel
i‚Äôll update so it doesn‚Äôt interrupt the match setup
so if i delete the prediction channel, will it fix everything?
it should, or disable predictions, or give it perms
thank you
Yeah I did hahaha
You‚Äôre a genius
Hey <@145305657237700608> 
bot not resending message in queue channel
also bot giving afk for every player
<@145305657237700608> smth major here
<@862441990247284736> bro? Bot don‚Äôt go down in the message.
im not seeing the same issue
yeah but issue is still there
<@145305657237700608> bot down?
bot still not sending queue message
can u invite me
Me too, bot don‚Äôt send the massage
sent invite in dm
also bot just banned me, however i was in voice chat
oh now bot send queue message
restarting always fixes this, im not any closer to finding the reason though
again bot not sending queue message
<@145305657237700608> can you restart bot again?
Save the Config 
End the Queue 
Load it again
Might work üôÇ
nah im restarting
working again
thanks
<@145305657237700608> 

Lb got reset?
which server
and did you change the queue name
Dexplorer
Its back now
no no
if you have a role requirement, it could make sense if someone refreshed during bot startup
Hm Right
how do I turn this off?
players mmr is showing in their nicknames in the server
its off by default
`/ratinginname`
it just appear from nowhere on mine too
fixed with the command tho
<@145305657237700608> paying for premium but it says I have a registered player cap
The bot also automatically put ELO back in names, just FYI easy fix
did you turn it off, but it turned back on automatically?
Right after restart is what my staff told me
did they turn it off right before restart
It has been off
It's also saying we have a 1000 player register cap
Even tho we paid for premium
what premium tier do you have
what does it say
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1072014162873561099/1076233806027165707/IMG_5095.png?width=310&height=671
thats happening right now?
My staff is telling me it is
i see
and i know why
ty neatz <3
ughhhhh
should be fixed btw
<@145305657237700608> the rating keeps showing i dont know why
it should not be updating any new names
you can remove the current ones with /ratinginname
okok
I need help idk how to setting the q
I want to add map and others things but idk how
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=maps
is it not possible for the bot to change the server owners' nickname?
you can only nickname people with less perms, nobody has more perms than the server owner, so unfortunately not
<@145305657237700608> it keeps showing the rating and it says all names a renamed
could you change the format to ($)
and retry
Too much of stuff i dont understand‚Ä¶
Can you tell me what is number vote vote s√©lection
Hi, is there a way to kick people out of a queue?
whats the command for that? srry D;
`/player remove`
`/ratinginname format`
Whoa, the queue emptied itself before I could do that "Emptying queue due to 60 minutes of inactivity"
Does the queue kick everyone out if nobody else joins the queue in 60 minutes, or does it kick people individually (after they've been in the queue for 60 minutes)?
both
there is /timer afk and /timer queuereset
im not too sure what you are asking
I have a other question
How we fix point for if a tesm win and if a team lose
I have a question, is there a specific MMR range that I see that the bot will assign for specific ranks? (valorant)
I couldn't find it in the docs
thank you üôè
/outcome can be used to change match results
you can assign roles with /autoroles
Ye but i want to do auto
Yeah I have that set up but I want to know how /register determines the MMR
what is the range?
its the actual value from the valorant API
so whatever valorant has for an MMR range
by default players vote for the winner
K and if i want for at 200 mmr Its give auto a role how i do that (last question Im sorry üòê)
`/autoroles`
how do i force a vote for the win
not all the required votes voted
`/outcome`
you should add some kind of honor system like league of legends after the match people can vote for mvp <@145305657237700608>
yea adding an MVP is a planned feature
ETA ü§©
oh ty one more question, is there a way to make it so people can't type in the chat for the queue once the queue starts and it creates said chat?
<@145305657237700608>
my entire server just lost 5 games in a row
not entirely sure how this happened LOL
<@145305657237700608> if a player is substituted, the player is not getting access to the vc
How to reset mmr of all player
Not 1 by 1
Like all in same Time
<@145305657237700608>
if you mean the normal queue channel, just change the perms
everyone?
./resetstats
i‚Äôll check
everyone
Thats remove all player mmr?
Not only for 1 queue
I did
But dont world
Works
‚Ä¶did you type confirm
And its says i have not
could you give me a user ID as an example
I ended
accidentaly
anyway to restart it?
without creating it 0
when you end a queue it gives you a config code, which you can /load
i meant like once everyone has joined the queue and it moves everyone and creates a new chat for that said queue, do i just need to change the perms for that new chat manually?
oh in that case you cannot disable send messages perms automatically, at least not right now
ahh okok ty
its not a huge deal just when i did a game yesterday and we had to vote the winner afterwards someone would type and it would reset the vote thing and re send the message
wdym reset the vote?
the vote count shouldnt change
its just a new message
like it wouldn't actually reset the vote but it would show a message and say 0/8 for example and wouldn't update until someone voted again
and then it kinda bugged out the counter at one point
oh okay, thats a bug then
its nothing bad or crazy tho since i can manually select outcome i was just wondering about the perms thing just incase so people can't try to type and stuff in the chat, and they can only click the buttons
should be not as bad once its fixed though
yeah, great bot though.  Everyone I got to play yesterday really enjoyed the process and thought it was better than us all manually doing stuff so keep up the good work üôÇ
Ok thanks
Last question
Can i see how many ppl are in the q
assuming you have names hidden, its in /info
Thanks
How do i active names?
`/anonymousqueue`
Thank you so much
You did an amazing job
<@145305657237700608> what's going on? only 6 games have been played
plus donate link isn't working
maybe you had a bunch of matches get cancelled?
not a single match was cancelled
idk, i just reset the day counts
so should be good
its kinda weird that cancelled matches counts to daily limit
fair
im on premium right now, cause people is playing more than 250 games per day incredible. i got a question my premium sub is for 30 days but i had 12 left from the basic, there is any chance to add that to the count or its just 30 days from now on on premium?
<@145305657237700608>
whenever you modify your plan, it should refund you the difference before applying the new plan
so for example
if you have 15 days of basic left, that is equal 2.5 credits, so if you change plans to Professional which is 20 credits, it should decrease your credits by 17.5, and you should have 1 month of premium
hopefully my math was right for that
ooh thats nice
ty for the info
how do i set vote for side? like attack / def on val for example
Add a Voting Menu
word word
thank u !!
im a little confused about the whole key thing what do i put there?
Key is the Side Heading, Like what you want the SideHeading to be
SIDE:
Would be good üôÇ
okok
Cheers!! üçª
yea maybe the key should be optional and just default to the title
Hey, maybe I'm crazy but in a server I'm in using this system, there is a group of players that show grouped when voting teams, it lists "player and friends" and not listing them individually
is that a thing? what feature is it under? its kinda ruining the point of the 1-2-2-1 draft picks
it‚Äôs cuz they are grouped in a party, so they must be all selected together
you can disable with /partyqueue
thank you!
Is there any way to have have a log of who initiated a cancel?
the command would show in the /logs
<@145305657237700608> Can we have a command that will show number of matches a player played
after the last reset
<@145305657237700608> bot shows that we already played 250 games for the day, even though im pretty sure we didnt. Did it maybe not reset or sth?
Where can I see the paid plans? I could not find it on the website
they were reset yesterday at 7PM EST
you have to log in and view your server
there were like 20 matches played since then, maybe a couple cancelled. But surely not 250
let me see, which server?
https://discord.gg/HV26V6zp
What's the command to reset the outcome of a specific game?
I don't want to reset the "entire queue" but just one game b/c of toxicity/leaver
./outcome cancel
thanks that worked
it should be reset again
ill check out to see if its counting right
ty ‚ù§Ô∏è
oh hmm looks like yours wasnt reset
interesting
<@145305657237700608>
how can i fix this
its doesnt show me anything else
probably missing perms
what about right now
still not
ok, now
works now ty! another thing, I accidentally enabled /serverstats queuename thingy, how do i make it so the channel doesnt get renamed?
reminds me, you can‚Äôt, i need to add a way to disable them
for now change to a different channel or delete the channel
or change to a new channel + delete
k ty
Hi, how does /matchmaking leniency work? Does it start increasing the MMR range the moment someone joins the queue? Or does it start increasing when there are enough people, but their MMR range is too far apart?
the matchmaker only starts up when there are enough players for a match
so it starts increasing after the matchmaker started and failed to start a match
Hello
Guys
I need help if there is one person who would help me program the bot I would be grateful for help
check out `/setup` (should get you pretty far) and https://docs.neatqueue.com
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to remove a player from leaderboards that has been banned?
should be able to do `/resetstats player`
and use their discord ID like this `<@31213123>`
which looks like <@2131231313>
I'm curious, why the discord Id?
the discord ID is all that discord needs to identify a user fully
the name isnt enough
Ohhhhhhhhhhh Okay
<@145305657237700608> ü•∫
yea sure, that can be added somewhere
although there isnt an existing command to view player details besides /stats
wait, it shows in /stats
Total games it does
i am talking bout game/day
when i do mmr change hidden it stays hidden just for that queue right? and its hidden from match results?
also does mmr decay only apply to people who have been inactive? or does it just apply to everyone?
<@145305657237700608>  These people joined the Queue VC why does it take them inactive?
So basically if you disable vote for results; Is it possible to close the temporary channel?
Hi, usually the message to do q always go at the bottom when someone writes, in this q it doesn't happen, how can I fix it?
Figured it out.
Hey <@145305657237700608>
Bot is not moving people into channels
I think today there are some problems:
-bot no longer moves people to voice channels
-q's message doesn't move down the chat
-a guy didn't join the q room and the bot banned all players, even those who had joined.
<@145305657237700608>
Its getting hectic now
restarting
sad this issue comes up, it‚Äôs been a few days
Sheesh Man, You'll have to sort this else you have to restart again and again
also its not dragging people to team vc's
restarting should solve it?
yea should be fixed
we have to do something? i dont know like restart the q or?
no, you can't do anything to fix it
ok ty
<@145305657237700608>  Apologies for the ping; Please could you help me out here?
should be good now
how can i take the player id if he left the server?
Sorry if it's a banal question
should be able to search for them if they ever typed a message
he never typed a message üò¶
whats their name
it applies to everyone who hasn't played for the specified duration
okay thank you !
queue size is 12
but now i tooks 14 to start
anyway to fix ?
you are in matchmaking mode, it only creates a match when there are 12 people in a close enough range
switch the `/queuetype` to PUGs if you just want it to start at 12
and will it change the leaderboard/elo of the players?
nope
<@145305657237700608> If Staff wants to cancel a queue before the team picks and veto starts, i.e *When players are asked to join queue vc*, How do we do it?
/outcome cancel
i think its working at any time
yea both /cancel and /outcome cancel should work at any point
<@145305657237700608> What are these?
wdym
<@145305657237700608> there is any chance you can restart only the number of games on the leaderboard?
you want to reset the number of games for each player?
not currently no
ok ty
What does each heading define?
pretty much exactly what it says
first 2 are totals, second 2 are daily
Hey, good evening.

How can I enable Voice Channels for Team 1 and Team 2 after the queue has been fully set up? I disabled it when I did /setup
Ah I found it
How can j remove rm option
Rematch
`/rematches`
plz check docs first, should be easy to just search for it
Ye but its like hard to search what i want to know üò≠
idk if you search rematch it pops right up
Kk and for this
Enable mmr
Last question ._.
Nvm i found
Are the leaderboards / stats command delayed? I had to manually adjust a couple players' mmr but the change isn't reflected in the leaderboard/stats/autoroles
no it should be basically instant
except if its the website, it will be delayed by up to a minute
So far the change is only reflected in their nicknames
/set mmr and /add mmr are the appropriate commands right?
Oh, when I used the commands in the queue channel it changed instantly
There might be a problem with /set /add mmr when they are used in a linked channel (and not the actual queue channel)
linking should be fine since if the command succeeded, it found the linked channel
perhaps its linked to a different queue?
Maybe, relinked just in case <:blitzcrankThumbsUp:607349298849513472> (also the command succeeded, i guess we'll know somethings up if it happens again)
Hello, /ratinginname does not update my nickname after MMR change (I'm the server owner)
yea, bots cannot nickname the server owner, nobody can
Any thoughts on this in the <#911057745204105237> 

> A way to pause/unpause the queue cancel counter if someone isn't joining. So admins can find a sub and not remake the whole queue
Damn, all g
makes sense, would have to change how the bot waits though but shouldnt be too bad
Is there a way for /ratinginname to display a new member's mmr when they join the server before they join queue?
yes, if you do `/ratinginname queuenames`
you can specify the queue name to use for nicknaming everyone, and it should nickname new people
Hello! Are you planning to add "banned roles from leaderboard"? Cause we want to allow players from higher division play in lower one, but they have 1000 mmr at the beginning, same as new "low elo" player. So bot cannot balance lobby properly. The only option for us - give players from higher division higher starting mmr, but they will occupy whole leaderboard
Maybe not even the role, but allow us manually remove player from showing in leaderboard without deleting his mmr
<@145305657237700608>  Don't know how to describe this perfect but basically; I add MMR to people and their stats page is different from ours and they dont show up on the leaderboard. They show on the points but not on the mmr even though we're adding mmr
Aspect is the broken user and I'm the one who shows on the mmr leaderboard
<@145305657237700608>
is it possible to cap the amount of members allowed in a party?
like only allow duos / trios etc
/reset stats player >> and then another option to make it specific queue
There has to be atleast 1 Win for it to show on the leaderboard
if i use reset stats, mmr will stay?
I just figured that.
Thanks.
mmr wont
But what if you have vote for results
disabled.
that will reset
Umm I have no idea, ig u can change the outcome of the match via staff channel no?
It doesn't send when vote for results is off
Damnn, then it becomes a fun queue you know
you dont care bout results, thats the setting
I only turned it off cause of like
Its meant to be FFA.
And Theres custom PR Distribution
So basically its messed up
ahhh thats over my head ü´†
Sorry
How about resetting points
to reset mmr?
no like points
I have no idea üò¶
/reset stats should work?
i tried
try adding fake points to urself
i did reset stats akk
and rest
all*
worked?
It works
But then to do that to everyone in the server
is aghh
/reset stats all/server
Nope.
Demn
yes /partyqueue
to show on the leaderboard you need the games count to be at least 1
oh i see someone answered lol
the issue with resetting points is that points aren‚Äôt a queue stat, so they don‚Äôt get reset
i‚Äôll update the reset command
yea i can do that today
it would be really nice
/resetstats player remove mmr? Cause i tried it and it removed my mmr
wdym
someone here told that /resetstats player does not remove mmr
But i tried it and it started my mmr from 1000 again after i played game
nah they were talking about points
anyway, im just waiting for banning roles in leaderboard
will make my life so easier
which is better, banned role for leaderboard, or required role
i guess banned role
cause with required role you need to adjust every leaderboard i guess
true
or if there is no required role, then everyone will be on leaderboard?
i guess, no required roles - noone on leaderboard
no banned roles - everyone on leaderboard
so adding banned roles wont affect already created leaderboards
yea i figured without a requiredrole set, everyone shows
but ill just do banned
i have it working, but i will release it later along with MVPs if everything seems good
later today?
Lets Gooooo
Also add "Number of Matches in the Past 7 Days" Please ‚ù§Ô∏è
not rn, i dont really know where that would be added
any way to make stats that shown from stats button hidden?
`/hidestats`
thanks
mvp and banned roles will be released today?
maybe
neatz
sorry if I annoy you
is there a way to make those channels visible to everyone
yes, change the permission for the category and give @ everyone View Channels permission
you're right
didn't think about it before
in the stats only
like /stats?
ye ye
seems like a random stat to add
How do I delete a queue? Can I just delete the embed/message?
/endqueue
can I have multiple /resultschannels? As in, a result channel for each queue?
trying to think about how mvp should work
i guess just a majority vote for a single player?
or if everyone votes, its the player with most votes
when i set required votes does it set that for anything that requires votes?
bc i have my requiredvotes set to 6 for match result but its also 6 for when voting on a map
is there a way to change or is it just 6 bc idm 6 but if i could change it that would be dopee
yea all required votes are the same
i want know how put rank with the role
for example, gold, platinum, etc
and how start the match because only give me banned ¬¥cause i don¬¥t know run the 1v1 or 2v2
`/autoroles`
huh?
can you help me on my server?
you could just explain what you are confused about
i want that run without no join to voice channel
for the voice channel queue that's 10/10 how do i stop other people that aren't in the queue joining? or is there a way to increase capacity size?
`/voicechannels`
could you clarify, are you saying you want more people to join
no, I just want the match to start without joining the voice channel
yes, use that command
People that aren‚Äôt in the game are joining so the capacity gets full and the ppl in the game can‚Äôt join the vc
So I need to up the capacity in the vc or restrict it to only players somehow
check your category permissions
the voice channels copy the category permissions
and the bot will deny @ everyone, but grant the players
i have to make the VC not allow @ evryone?
its a public category tho
no im assuming your category grants Connect permissions to everyone
ya it does
what?
so i disable that?
this command
voicechannels mode?
oh, yes
he say that no find the queue?
did you start a queue?
yeah but that say is not
can you help me on my server?
no sorry
you must have a queue running to config it
how confi the leadrboard?
`/leaderboard` shows the leaderboard for a queue
i did that and now they cant join in general
wdym
who cant join
dopai !
if i have @ everyone can connect then everyone from the server can join the /voicechannels 10/10 channel

If i have it disabled then no one can join at all
dont disable it, just put it in the middle
Noted good comms
Yoo can I do 2 queue Channels for one mmr system ?
is everything right here?
looks good
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
What happens if player join queue and gets 1000 starting mmr, then he gets role that should give him 1200 starting mmr. His mmr will stay at 1000 or move to 1200?
stay at 1000
got it
my leaderboard is empty for one of my queues
like it got reset overnight üò¶
Hey <@145305657237700608> , for some reason delay voting menu is not working
i have it for 900 seconds, but players can vote instantly
thats just cuz the bot was restarting
got it
i see, strange
the causing error is the bot's connection to discord was reset, so ill have to check that out
did you change the queue name
i haven't done anything with it since setting it up
and i tried checking audit log to see if someone someone else did but it's the same
whats the server id
where can i find that
bot loading veto too long
now its like this, buttons not active for players
<@145305657237700608>
when i used outcome cancel, bot just did this
did their MMRs actually change
its still showing here, but i reset all stats
ok, with ctrl +f5 its gone
but it was like this before i reset stats
and whats wrong with map veto?
did the winner message pop up?
in that match? Yes
buttons for veto was not active, then its just skipped veto and went to winner message
like its randomly banned maps
yea it probably just kept going through the vote
probably something weird with it reusing the messages
can you test if everything ok?
i locked queue so i dont need to cancel matches
i see the issue with cancel, but i didnt touch voting menus
my guess is its something with clicking too fast
i  got this message when was trying in test mode
whats ur config /save
it always bug when 3 maps left
WMCGW
i cancelled match when winner vote message was in chat and got this again
got it
any way to fix voting menu?
Maybe new message everytime? And deleting old message
MVP and other new Features live?
server id as in my discord link?
right click on server name
ah thank you
Server ID in question: 1021498784670298152
i will try to check is everything okay with captains pick
i got one error "this interaction failed" but was able to keep picking and it didnt broke anything
map veto was also working fine
just a little bit slow reaction from bot
usually means the bot wasn't waiting for clicks yet
yeah but i had no problems with veto when i had captains pick
without captains pick map veto was broken
will try one more time
can you fix cancel problem?
nice
<@145305657237700608> Is the bot off or smth?
no pop-ups showing up
sorted now
<@145305657237700608> its bugged again
looking at your server now
even with captains pick
<@123229985791016961> i see you have stats still
ok its working again, just skipped 1 ban
its just visual bugs
but they shouldnt be happening
under the hood the bans are still registering
weird
any way to fix this?
yea its just how the current set up works
if you click buttons too fast, discord ratelimits editing the message
so when the new edit happens, it might be replaced by an old edit
cuz the old edit was delayed
so maybe you return to new ban - new message
for now at least
or make it an option
id rather just fix the editing version, no need for new messages cuz its cluttering
ok, will wait for fix then
any eta for this fix and cancel fix?
whenever the bot gets a second it will update itself
the bot waits for match setups to finish before restarting
im not forcing this update
oh so you fixed it
how many matches are ongoing?
its a bit better at least for now
oh btw, can you check how many unique players we have on server?
cause i think its not right
too big number
true
i guess reset stats doesn't currently reset that to 0
so it started counting duplicates
yeah probably
any way to fix?
yes yes, not right now
<@145305657237700608> players cant join queue, even if they r not in the match
it was match in different queue
oh lol
i set requeue condition to wait for match winner to be selected
yea i see
will also be fixed in update
also for mvp, anyone can vote after match? Or im able to do it cause im admin
cause i have this button active
can you push update? Cause players cant vote when its bugged
next map after bug is not removing
so you cant know what your enemy banned
update went through
button is visible to everyone
yeah but vote counts from everyone or only players that were in a match?
ok now i have this message
but earlier i was able to vote from dropdown menu
Somethings wrong about the database <@145305657237700608> ?
I cant see the leaderboard rn
don't know why
it's blank
I already link the channel
<@145305657237700608> Hey, how do i add for suppose 200 MMR to players with a specific role
at once
it only shows the point section
winrates/MMR/Games are gone
<@145305657237700608> look at your <#1006918522166837310>
it's also blank
<:monkaS:675256965936578563>
whats your config?
Hoi ü•∫
there isnt a way to bulk update players currently
ahh shittt
<@145305657237700608> Can we have something soon?
yea its in the planned features
wdym
Ahh Nice
not you, but whats your /save config
QGPUC
OSKXS
you mean the code
right?
yes thats good thanks
sure things
so what happened?
you have a role requirement set, does everyone have that role?
leaderboard will only show people with that role
I got 2 queues
and they are 2 different roles
I think yes
at least it's fine rn
tysm
its fine?
status?
it will show mvp only when everybody vote?
someone needs the majority
maybe you can add vote counter somewhere, so players can see how many votes has been done
sure i‚Äôll add that in the dropdown
maybe you can add it right to "vote mvp" button
so everyone can see it
leaderboard is working now! thanks <:peepolove:905515252232355880>
<@145305657237700608> /resetstats removing IGN?
it should be yes
Hello, are there any problems with the bot? It is no longer creating the room of the q
If I don‚Äôt have decay set
The month should not reset the leader true?
if decay is not enabled, then nobody will lose MMR
is there a way to make the bot post the leaderboard after a game ends?
not currently
thanks for the response
if i make variance 5000, players will get more mmr and lose more mmr if lobby is not balanced?
no you will have to decrease the value for that
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=mmr-change-variance
so the best value to get the most mmr from winning in lower rated team is variance "1"?
but if you use the calculator, you will see that is a bad idea
im stupid, i dont understand that calculator)
whats the best variance to punish bad captains pick
i think the default is fair
1600
if you want to punish a bit more, use 800
this will be released in the next update though
i liked the idea
<:sage:878678207115689984>
except it will not post a leaderboard, it will just update the most recent one
makes sense
so if i pin the leaderboard link will that not be the updated one?
cause that was my solution for now
no its just whatever the most recent leaderboard posted was
ok thanks when do you think that update will be out anyway
just curious cause that's when I'll pin the leaderboard then
tomorrow morning EST
with the / still people not in the queue can still join the vc D:
what am i doing wrong
check the permissions for the channel, what does it show?
I may just be missing something, is there a log for queues that get cancelled due to someone dodging? I have a logs channel that gets final match results but no messages for queues that cancel
also, im assuming you didnt turn off `/channel restrictions`?
not currently, only matches that reach the teams stage get logged to the channel
would be good to add logs for cancelled though
I will throw it in <#911057745204105237>
Thanks!
so when people go into their queue channels, they cant type in it but the channel perms are neutral / allows them to
only server boosters can type
what perm is missing?
players perms to type in the queue channel they are in
which role is being denied?
im assuming its your category permissions that deny send messages
like i have to manually enable send message one for each queue channel
somewhere you are denying the permission
but the category allows it
what are you manually changing then?
each send msg option
yea the bot will by default put the send messages perm in the middle option
so if people cant send messages, you have some override somewhere
cuz it means the bot isnt explicitly allowing/denying the perm
yeah but the category the queue is under allows it
sigh so confused
im not sure then sorry
ty for helping
its discord perms so something must be denying
ill see
maybe the role perm
i fixed it
tysm
what are points
and can i disable them?
https://i.imgur.com/vFuqXro.png
(bug report) I keep getting DM'd this despite not being in the queue for a while.
probably going to have to block the bot as a temporary solution...
enable what? i‚Äôm getting unsolicited DMs because the bot thinks i‚Äôm queue dodging
i‚Äôm not an admin nor developer‚Ä¶ you should probably check the docs
<@145305657237700608> Hey, I have around 100 + Players whose MMR has to be increased by a few hundreds
any way?
other than manually doing all the 100+ ü´†
Whats Total Players? Is it sum of players who've atleast 1 match? or?
<@145305657237700608> i just set my leaderboard to reset every month
I've lost all the data? Leaderboard has become blank now ü•≤
What does rolling do?
i just disabled, it workeddddddddddddd
changing to monthly gives a fresh slate for the month
are you saying you aren‚Äôt in that queue?
correct
i actually got DM'd twice more overnight
anyone in the system
likely someone is adding you to a queue manually
hmm ok
https://i.imgur.com/7kcpcDF.png
Owwwwww so the data wont erase?
data isn‚Äôt erased unless you reset stats
yea, someone added you to queue
üôå Jeeeeezzzzz
I doubt this is the case
why?
well, why would someone add me to the queue, do it in a private channel in the middle of the night, when no other players are in queue?
probably staff trying to test the queue
the afk kick message only starts when a player is added to the queue, and the bot only uses discord IDs to reference players so it‚Äôs not some random occurrence
anyway i can change the /startqueue to be one team instead of two?
one team of 5, instead of two teams of 5
yea, there is an optional argument in that command to set the number of teams
or just do `/numberofteams`
love that, thank you
do i have to do something to update the bot or turn this setting on or does it happen automatically?
and if I understand it correctly I can pin a leaderboard link and that leaderboard will be constantly updated?
it will be automatic, didn‚Äôt update today since i‚Äôm away for the weekend and don‚Äôt wanna have to fix anything
no worries totally understand
hope you have a good weekend
How do I change the names of the games? I want to make it NHL but it isn‚Äôt letting me I can only choose from the ones already on there, also can I have multiple games with multiple different leaderboards in a server and how do I set that up
wdym choose from the ones on there
Like Valorant
what are commands are you talking about
Queue name
just type the name you want
I tried to do make the Queue name nhl and it said no queue found
just reply with the name, don‚Äôt use the command
Can multiple people use the queue or do you need to purchase that?
the free tier lets you have 500 different people queue
Thank you!
i set my staff role as staff on the bot
but they can‚Äôt unlock the queue
what does it say
they said it says they don‚Äôt have perms but i set it again and ima see if it works now
<@145305657237700608> how do you turn off the "are captains valid?"
/reshuffle
for ppl that get kicked/banned from the discord doe sthe leaderboard update that automatically? or is that manual
and if it is manual, how can i do that?'
it does not delete the stats, you would have to do it manually
via /resetstats using the discord id
i‚Äôm thinking though, if you set the rolerequirement to @ everyone, then they won‚Äôt pop up
When you do /ping with anonymous mode on, it'll show everyone that is in queue
Also, is there a way to change teams after picking? If someone misclicks
<@145305657237700608>  i noticed the multiqueue command has dissapeared ..
this command does not exist in our server anymore
We had a guy that was playing his games from the first queue, but he was in another queue. So he couldn't join the new lobby cause he hadn't finished the game he first got into. It held up the lobby and the 2nd queue timed out......
hmmm
it shouldn‚Äôt be possible to be in a second queue while in a match
good catch
no not currently
Hey there, we are using your bot in our server but noticed that sometimes, users won‚Äôt be displayed by their discord names but rather a string of numbers. Is there a fix to this? There is no way to ping these people and you can‚Äôt click them to see who it is, so it just becomes a guessing game. Thank you
this is a discord mobile issue, those users are not in the apps internal cache, so it just shows numbers
if you go on desktop, or view a message from that user, it fixes
outside of my control though
Ty for quick reply
If a user queues in two queues and 1 queue pops, will they be removed from any other queues they are in?
is there a way to add a cooldown? like if someone joins the queue but then doesnt join the actual vc, is there a way for it to automatically put that person on like a 30 min cooldown or something
or is that already a thing sorry if it is and i just dont knowe
/player autoban
i can see the leaderboard
yes?
how?
i put /leaderboard and that put a link to top.gg
yes, did you read what it says you must do
what i should that?
yes follow what it says
<@145305657237700608>  Is there  a way to make Temporary channel transcripts. If not this would be a really cool addition for alot of reasons.
Getting these errors when /voicechannels mode is set to 'Required'.
do /teamselection and re select your options
are you using an old config?
currently the bot does not have access to read chat messages, but i could request that from discord if there is real interest
<@145305657237700608> can the Cancel command be modified to be used by Staff
you can always modify command permissions via your server's integrations tab
although staff commands cannot be modified to allow non-staff to use them
The thing is, when i try to use, it says you just be in queue to use it
but i am the staff
use `/outcome cancel` for the staff version
ahh okay
Thanks, okay will try that. Yes it is an old config.
The /teamselection worked! thanks.
<@145305657237700608> 

anyway i can change, it to 7/8 Votes needed to cancel a match?
not currently, all voting requirements are linked
ahh okay, can i change the voting req?
`/requiredvotes`
Thanks
<@145305657237700608> Can i add "roles" to an existing queue>
Like ingame roles > For ex: Intiator, Sentinel , Duelist, Controller
`/roles`
Thanks, Any restrictions on the number of in game roles?
no, but it will resize the team size to match
unless you set required to False
`/roles roles:Initiator,Sentinel,Duelist,Controller required:False `
Hi <@145305657237700608> , I saw that there is a command "/substitute [player], which allows a player to be replaced.
But if a player for some problem loses the connection and can no longer go back to discord, that command becomes useless because the one who needs to be replaced must do it.
So I ask, do we moderators have a command to replace a specific player with another?
yes `/player sub`
ok thanks, and i guess player 1 is the one who needs to be replaced right?
ty again
Hey <@145305657237700608> 
How can i remove enable/disable mmr?
`/mmr change allow_disable`
Thanks!
is there a way to remove options like example when picking captains there is an option to vote for random captains, can i remove that option?
or can i only have the default menu or just one
Never got around to making that fully customizable, so you are limited to all or just one
okok
ik this is prob like placebo but ppl keep saying its bugged, so just to confirm it even tho ik the answer bc i dont want anyone to bug me.  i am using the bot for like valorant scrims and we have the maps setup and when we vote random it always picks one map more than others
yea that is placebo. True randomness does not feel very random
would have to adjust so the "random" favors less picked maps
but, then its not random
yeah alright i figured i just wanted to proof from the dev incase someone wants to complain to me abt it LOL
yea that‚Äôs fair
<@145305657237700608> is it possible to make it so 7/10 are required to vote before you can requeue?
is there a way to permanently disable the /tempchannels?
also is there an option to extend the time for a queue before it gets cleared?
for inactivity
<@145305657237700608> there is any option where you NEED to be on the vc designated to join queue?
<@145305657237700608> hey
shouldn‚Äôt the vote have already ended?
it‚Äôs a majority vote
disabling will turn it off completely
/timer queuereset
no not right now
<@145305657237700608> 

When i put roles, >> Can the bot lock the particular role as soon as 2 slots of a role get filled?
no, but also over queuing a role just means they wont play next, they have to wait an extra match
Ahh Isee
<@145305657237700608> Rn it doesn't show the player roles in STAFF Channel 

anyway i can fix it or its only u who can do it 
 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/918387409153056819/1079847732820324533/image.png?width=1180&height=663
yea its not configured to show it there
Ahh I see, Can you configure it? üëÄ  Please ‚ù§Ô∏è
yea but not right now
Ahh sadge, Ok
is this a Discord restriction? or possible
depends which cooldown
NeatQueue has a custom 2 second cooldown for queue buttons to avoid spam, but it sends a message that you are on cooldown to the user
Hey <@145305657237700608> 
I got my queue set up like that (but just removed "everyone" from starting mmr)
Some players told me that they got 1000 starting mmr, however they got platinum(1300) and diamond (1600) roles
What could be the problem?
^this happened to me too
Maybe "everyone" somehow override one of custom roles?
Also I enabled streaks here's the config code FXBHU but it doesn't seem like the streaks have changed how much mmr someone gets when does the streak kick in after 3 wins, 5 wins?
also 1 player got 1600 starting mmr (diamond) instead of 1900 starting mmr(ascendant)
what could be the problem?
In this match
Kroops - got 1000 mmr instead of 1600
Fujy - got 1600 instead of 1900
–°—Ç–∞—Ä—ñ–π—à–∏–Ω–∞ - got 1000 instead of 1600
Manifest - got 1000 instead of 1300
queue: HVFTE
next match, and again 2 new players got wrong starting mmr
<@145305657237700608> how to fix?
it has nothing to do with the roles themselves, cause other players with same roles got correct starting mmr
that player must have had both the roles ig?
just trynna help mb
no, they could have only 1 role at a time
maybe they had it earlier
but i reset stats before assigning new roles
Ahhh I See
check your /info
oh nvm
this lobby was played after i removed "everyone" role from starting mmr
So for 2 players to get 1000mmr, they should have "gold" role
But they have "platinum" and "diamond"
they probably got their starting MMR before you removed it
but anyway, everyone role cant override other roles
right?
they cant join queue without one of rank roles
players will get the highest possible starting MMR given their roles
right yea
so how its working, like players queued with roles that higher than 1000 starting mmr, but got only 1000
it was only possible that everyone override their roles
i can try to reset stats one more time
and see if problem will happen without "everyone" role in queue
it should assign the starting MMR based on the highest role with a starting mmr
mmr assigns when player join queue for the first time after reset?
ok, i will check if everything fine one more time
could it be that discord give mmr for the roles, that were removed?
so like they had role with 1000 mmr earlier, but now they have role with 1600 mmr and joining queue for the first time since reset
it should only use their current roles
if i reset stats before match ends, match results will go to new stats?
Bringing this back got mixed in with another conversation
it should, yea
streak multiplier applies for 2 consecutive wins/losses
Doesn‚Äôt seem to be changing mmr gain then
its a pretty minor multiplier
Ok then maybe it is
I guess too big of a multiplier would unbalance games quickly so nvm
Thanks for the response
`0.04 * (streak - 1) + 1` is the calc
Ok makes sense
i have a channel for the leaderboard and it keeps spamming saying to vote
do i need to vote every month to make sure to keep the leaderboard command up?
its now march in UTC
Sorry <@145305657237700608>. It should be the mmr result always show +0
even thought I clicked the result
the mmr page still doesn't change
but players mmr/winrate/win/loss  do
and if I wanna change the result
the bot would said
"Could not find the match channel. Perhaps it was deleted?"
you shouldnt need to link to the queue channel
perhaps that is breaking it
wdym?
oh linking doesnt matter
I actually created a new staff channel
does the queue channel exist still?
I see
yeah
the bot cant seem to find it
you didnt delete/recreate the queue channel
I actually done that 5 mins ago
I ended my original queue
and crated a new queue
and new staff channel
now everything is fine
don't know why
but it works
what about MVP
like any requirements?
if I got 10 players
How many votes we should get to get a MVP
or 5?
by default, 6
THANKS
<@145305657237700608>  If I was correct, any role with manage channel perms is able to manipulate mmr?
Well I have a role I give to people handling mmr. And they have the permission to manage channels yet when they put in the command it says "You do not have the permission to run this command"
hi i can not cancel a match when i do /cancel in queue channel its not working and when i do in the match channel its not detecting the command
<@145305657237700608> I can link multiple Q channels? to a channel?>
and check stats?
Hey <@145305657237700608> 
Is it possible to make that win and loss mmr gain to be the same for everyone on the team (like on faceit)
So it not depend on each player mmr
I want everyone to receive +32.6 mmr (team 1), no matter what individual mmr is
How do I disable this?
itll check their perms for the current channel
wdymm
no, MMR calculation is done at the player level
you can change the display to be the average though
`/winnermessage format mode:Simple `
`/reshuffle`
it would be cool option though
so it calculates mmr gain from team avg mmr
not individual mmr
idk thats not very common
i know faceit do it in csgo
cause it makes sense, mmr scaling like "lowest mmr get highest mmr gain" could be abused
if low mmr player playing in party with 4 high mmr players, he will get to his teammates mmr faster
but we dont know if he deserve it
so when he get same mmr as everyone, he wont climb to his teammates mmr if he dont play solo games
the elo formula  takes into account the average MMR of your own team too
so if you are being carried, you don't get as much
Can the administrator cancel the game? If so, what is the command?
/outcome cancel match_number:
hi question, is there a way for me to add a 1.5x multiplier to q wins? I saw the /multiplier and i was able to do wins in general but I wasn't sure what that looked like
not exactly a multiplier, but you can change the base amount for wins/losses
example `/mmr change set amount:30 loser_mmr:20`
win = 30 MMR, lose = 20 MMR
ohh yes thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
can I make it so people dont go negative?
yes set an `/mmr floor mmr: 0`
Is there an Aduti Log Queue?
<@145305657237700608>
And is there a points system?
there is `/logs`, but its only for commands
there are points and MMR if that answers
But how do I add it?
channel
I want to transfer a member
the voice team
huh?
is there a way to make it so people don't show up on the leaderboard until they've played 5 games or any amount of games? I wanna hide people that have only played 1 or 2 games.
not currently, that could be a good config though
For some reason MMR isn't updating for the next queue, is that normal?
wdym next queue
Is the bot dead?
I am getting this message every time y try to do /stats
Hey there, I've got one of the leaderboards showing the months on top left of the site, while the other 2 leaderboards don't show it and just show the all-time rankings (while I decide when to reset). Is there a way to make it show all-time only and remove the monthly rankings without resetting the actual leaderboards? Or at least having "All Time" to be selected right when you open the rankings page?
I already used the /leaderboardconfig monthly toggle:Disabled mode:Reset command before March, but it still shows March in the leaderboards
hmm alright, that would be a bug then
ill see if i can replicate
what URL is this in reference to?
https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/1043184884212043848/1064542976417738802
fixed
thanks!
Hey I was also wondering, is there a way to have different queues, but every higher queue starts from a higher mmr? 
I mean, let's put for example that I have Rank A, Rank B and Rank C. I'd like Rank C to start at 500, Rank B at 800, Rank A at 1000 points. So if a player from Rank C reaches 800 points he gets promoted to rank B. (But every Rank can only queue for their rank)
Is it already possible to do that right now?
I was thinking about the universal queue, but if i didn't get it wrong every rank can just play together, correct me if i'm wrong
you can create different queues, add a `/rolerequirement`, set the starting MMR per role with `/startingmmr`, then use `/autoroles mmr` to let people rank up + down
Ok thank you, I'll try it tomorrow
<@145305657237700608> , Is there a way to disable the option for parties to be created before beng able to join a tournament?
not quite following, in order to join a tournament you must be in a party
Hi, in queues that require a party to join, each player's MMR gain/loss is calculated separately, yes? So if "party A" is disbanded, the players will keep their MMR if they join another party, yes?
<@145305657237700608> NQ underdoing update now?
it shows interaction failed
and then completes the action
Just to make sure, does this make higher mmr players to lose more points if they queue in a lower rank and lose? (and at the same time win less points if they win?)
yes, but with the role requirement they can‚Äôt queue in low ranks
Oh so if I want Rank A players to be able to queue in Rank B while risking more points to lose, it doesn't work if I set rolerequirement both to rank A and B?
it does in that case
Yo ! I've got 10 channels for queuing actually but previous channels were disabled because of premium feature and when i try to load them this is not working even if i've got 10 channels only actually. How can i put them working again without redoing all the setup for each ?
I've got this message and since i can't load them
Is there a way to regenerate them ?
i guess when queues are stopped like that, the config is not saved
so unless you have the config code, you would have to remake them
i got the config code but this is not working anyway
this is why i'm here
what is it saying?
nothing
i just can't interact with the queue after load
but the load works
can't interact, so you dont see any message pop up
did you modify channel perms?
nope
try `/mmrrequirement` again
also what is the config code?
something messed up with it
HPDBV
oh is that config code super old?
lol idk this is the previous code i've got why this has changed since ?
yea its too old to be used !
you might be able to get away with it if you do `/mmrrequirement` and `/teamselection`
to reconfigure those two settings
i've got maps configured too
i've got so many things configured on those queues
maps should be fine
its just those 2 configs were changed in the past
ok i'll try this
so the old config has old config data
leaderboards are counting like queue too ?
or it is different ?
wdym
because on leaderboards channels i've got the warning message too
it only counts channels with a queue running
<@145305657237700608> , Is there a possibility to add a specific time before VFR is done. If not this should be added as a command.
VFR?
how do i end a queue thats running when we dont have enough people in it even tho ppl joined
you can end a queue with /endqueue
or just leave it running
yeah we just left it running, one of my roles doesnt have access to join the queue. i can give it access by using "/roles" right and then adding it? or how can i add it so its able to join queue?
you must‚Äôve set a role requirement, all roles can queue by default
and /roles is meant to set in game roles, if that applies to the game
Hello, I got this situation
Any idea why does it happens?
how were teams created?
Balanced enable mmr
would not have expected it to be from balanced
you know if people are in parties?
HEy <@145305657237700608>
I just reset mmr for all queues in the server
But "RAIDERS" queue doesn't seem to eraze
Why so?
It just got erased, with quite some delay üòê
2 Different Numbers? ü§î 

Why does this Happen?
the server counts don‚Äôt get erased currently
something i need to fix
if you give me the server ID ill do it manually for now
in ur DM's
Yeah, full solo
What i'm doing is giving and resting the points manually when it happens
it happens frequently?
could you share the config code /save
Not really, this was the second time it happened
Sure, I do /save and then send it to u?
yes plz
TOPEO
Also it happens that doesnt unlock and lock at the time I put  it
Sometimes, not all the time
Hey <@145305657237700608> I am new to your bot but I'm trying to make a server for Valorant Customs with my friends but I am trying to figure out a map ban system and a captain select, could you please let me know what commands to use to set that up? Thank you
Actually, i used my brain and just searched for them the most basic way possible and figured it out xD Nvm
If I make bo3 match, is it possible to make veto like this :
Team 1 Ban
Team 2 Ban
Team 1 Pick
Team 2 Pick
Team 1 Ban
Team 2 Ban
Last map picked
the autounlock says the wrong time when i set it
and when i choose a timezone it always says invalid timezone
what time zone did you pick?
i tried US or CA
i wanna set it to 8pm to auto unlock and i tried setting it to 20:00 so it would unlock at 8 but it set it to 3pm instead
it‚Äôs using UTC by default
the timezones that pop up are categories
you need to type more in iirc
like America/New York
US and CA aren‚Äôt timezones themselves
ahh okay i wasn't sure how it worked thanks and yeah i just read that it says UTC by default alright thanks
yea they should be changed to show specific timezones
i have a error with the queue
no let me join to the queue
that say lost permissions
what error exactly
Hey, idk if it's another bug, but probably after this fix, one of my leaderboards is not showing anymore on the site. The leaderboard is this one: https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/1043184884212043848/1064551786607808512

It works normally if people use the command /leaderboard, but doesn't work on the site only
Ok nevermind, I had to use the monthly: disabled command otherwise it wouldn't show up on the site, might be useful to know for the future
it should show on the website no matter the monthly setting
and you are saying the leaderboard was showing in discord, but not online?
Got an issue where the bot is deleting the channels after five mins
<@145305657237700608> if you‚Äôre free
Immediately deletes after people leave vc^
is the channel empty?
As in?
It wasn‚Äôt doing this before, however now whenever 10 people join the vc the bot would create the room and after people leave the vc it auto deletes
the bot will auto delete empty channels
is what i‚Äôm referencing
How do I stop it from doing that?
currently you can‚Äôt disable that
<@544711857429282826> maybe you try explaining as it didn‚Äôt use to do this before
It was actually alright before. But in this past period it deletes those channels and doesn't actually register the queue
we‚Äôre probably talking about different things
Yes i believe so
could you give a step by step
Is it possible to actually show you in the server?
Rec the current one
Current queue
And send here
First all the people join the queue and the channels are created after all the process takes place in channels people are assigned the teams and soon the channels are deleted without any notice or anything
so people make it into the team channels
but it deletes them soon after
and the channels are not empty, right?
Nor the queue gets registered so the points are not given either
does the winner message pop up?
also, can you /save and send it here
Nope
We can't change the outcome or anything
No points are given
Nor does it show anything else
yea just send the config
so i can run it
How can i do that?
do /save
and post the code
Queue configuration saved as: MHHUF
ah, you have /voteforresult Disabled
enable that
Okay
We'll check it out and let you know
as for the voice channel thing, that is still weird
I believe once we leave the vc the bots deletes the channel figuring that the channel is empty
it shouldnt since it verifies the channel is actually empty
so im not quite sure
what default selection menu does?
it‚Äôll show a vote for all the options
thanks
Cool feature:
If player is captain for X games in a row, he cant be picked for Y next games
We have vote for captains, and some players become captains like 5-6 times in a row and its annoying for them'
Is it possible to make?
It would be really nice feature, hope you can add it <@145305657237700608>
is this "Queue into Teams" Released?
yea /queuetype
that‚Äôs like 1 year old
is there and way to contact you privat or in a ticket?
sure just shoot me a DM
i tried using the auto unlock and auto lock feature and i set everything properly but it didn‚Äôt unlock at the right time. i set it again to make sure and test it again later today.
alright i‚Äôll have to check it out then
i‚Äôm planning on retiring auto lock, and making all commands schedulable
using a new system
yeah ima test it again tonight to make sure. but i set it like,  auto unlock enabled, time zone america/ny , time 19:30 , repeat daily yes.
nice that sounds good
dunno how to set up a siege que, no one can join it, dunno how to fix this
what issue are you seeing?
i used the config from here for siege but have no join que button
i see, the bot is missing permissions in your channel then
and can‚Äôt send the message
its sending messages i just cant get it set up properly
can i just send a dm
sure
<@145305657237700608> Is there a way to reboot the bot ? I think it's frozen because I'm trying to setup my autoroles and all it says is: NeatQueue is thinking
no that is not the issue
when you set autoroles it will reconfigure the roles for every user that matches the new criteria
so depending on your server size, might take a bit
Oh well it just said The application did not respond on all the commands I sent. I'll try to send them 1 by 1
for autoroles?
Yeah
how many users are you modifying roles for?
100-150
is it actually modifying roles though?
It was, before I wanted to make changes
But the changes didn't work
All right, 1 role at a time it works sorry to for bothering you
auto roles is very slow when modifying a bunch of people
discord does not have a bulk update members API, so it goes 1 by 1
wont let me vote on top gg for leader boards
what‚Äôs the issue
global queues are, queues over multiple servers right?
so i could open a global queue for a 3v3 game with multiple roles and have that queue be joinable from different servers?
or do all players have share at least one server?
ok i set up a global queue but the leaderboard is empty, does the leaderboard reset every time a new server "joins the Queue"?
global queues just share the leaderboards
and no they don‚Äôt reset
how can I start a match without joining to the voice chat?
change /voicechannels
optional
Hello
i want to ask how to set admin command in #admin section and let user check leaderboard join queue in #user section?
for leaderboards, either let people type commands, or just type the command yourself and let them refresh
what do you mean set admin command
thank you
can i let queue join leave view in #queue only but people can command in #chat?
you can /link in #chat to the queue
if the commands don‚Äôt already work
not work
you need to use the command
i think this is the problem
i cannot link anything because i limit the channel permission
when i tried to add channels, the integrations cannot be edit
well yea if you manually edit the integration permissions, it‚Äôs different
you would need to enable commands in that channel
at least the commands you want
enable /link and then disable it
ok i try to disable the integration
It work
thanks
i remove the integration
and re invite neatqueue to server
nice
Is there any maximum players list on neatqueue free user?
yes it‚Äôs 500 players
how many users for basic premium?
1000
and it counts only unique users or duplicates as well?
it‚Äôs all unique player counts
cause /serverstats counts duplicates
the total count shouldn‚Äôt iirc
no way that my server have 730 unique players
100% someone duplicates
let me check
actually i‚Äôll do it later
yeah check it when you have time
What is going on with march history channels ?
Mine is not updating mmr changes
could you elaborate
Is there a way to delete queue data and restart on my setup?
ah i found it nevermind
To have the map veto do I have to do /map bans and set the amount of map bans each team gets?
Currently there‚Äôs a list of maps and first captain just gets to pick the map but I want to make it so each captain gets to remove a map till it‚Äôs one remaining
yes you need to add map bans
even if you add 100 map bans, it will ban down to 1 map
and the last map will be auto selected
Ahh cool
Thanks
Question: Can i make different leaderboard queue in 1 server?
Is it premium payment is one time payment or monthly payment sir?
Is there a way to ping everyone in a game? For example I want to ping everyone to vote for the winner at the end of the match but I don't want to ping the whole server
Just click ping in queue matchmaking
Easy
I love this bot
is there a setting to enable that? i dont see it
In default setting, ping is already enabled
yes if you name the queues different
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
it will only show if you have /voicechannels Required
there is no button to ping after everyone joins the voice channel
i follow the procedure of setting up the bot but for some reason when i did it myself, whenever people filled the queue, the bot would make the voice channel and text channel for it but never display a prompt for people to join the voice channel and it would be just stuck. any idea why?
Cool, last question I think

If I want the voice channels to be public so spectators can join, but the setup channel to be private so only players can see and type in it, is that possible?
how to setup?
probably missing permissions
either set a /spectatorrole, or modify the category permissions
just /queuename
if the names match, the stats will be shared
yes, missing perms, i see the error for your server
Yeah I have a spectator role, but they can see the text channels and voice channels. I'm wondering if its possible for them to only see voice channels
what perms if i may ask?
different queue=> accumulation with other queue or it count same queue server with 500 members?
not via /spectatorrole, you can do that with modifying category permissions
send messages, you probably have it denied in the category, so the created channels also has it denied
if you are talking about the player limit, it‚Äôs 500 unique players in the server
queues don‚Äôt matter
if i pay premium, is it 1 time payment?
or monthly?
im assuming its because i have it so @ everyone because they cant send messages but i made sure neatqueue the bot specifically had those, interference then
you buy credits, and then add 30 days to your premium counter
you can check the perms for the new channel and see what‚Äôs missing
i just enabled /lobbychannel pullall and it seemed to fix it, i made sure for it's role has the perms as well
that would be unrelated for sure
interesting
then idk, it fixed after i did those things, maybe im just lucky
thanks for the help btw, this bot that you made is really cool
keep up the great work!
thanks!
is there anyway to pause and continue queue?
it means all queue have active and incative time for playing ELO queue
Also actually when you pick captains, like 3 or 4 options come up like random captains vote for captains or 2 highest and lowest elo
Anyway I can make it so it‚Äôs only one of them?
Like just 2 highest elo in leaderboard
How to let admin choose winner dependes winner vote?
/lock and /unlock
/captainselection
just do /outcome
If someone making queue and vote fake/wrong result , is there any way to cancel the result/edit the result by admin?
yes, /outcome
for the [upper_rating] argument, does the player have to pass this mmr to get the role, or reach it? So if its set to 1500, and the player has 1500, does he get the role?

Same question for [lower_lose_rating], does the player have to pass below or just reach
Like all the games on the match history appear as +0 -0
i‚Äôll add to the docs, but upper ratings are exclusive, lower ratings are inclusive
1500 player would lose the role
there isn‚Äôt a match result
No I mean
All games have ended
And mmr have changed on player side
If you see the game they are from yesterday
So i should set it up like this?

./autoroles mmr set [lowerank] [0] [1500]
./autoroles mmr set [upperrank] [1501] [2000] [1501]
nope, the second one would be 1500 - 2000
otherwise 1500 would have no rank assigned
that would be strange if it‚Äôs not updating after a winner was selected
Okay cool got it now
./autoroles mmr set [upperrank] [1500] [2000] [1500]

Cool bot btw, my community loves it
Look
you don‚Äôt need the loser_lose_rating if it‚Äôs the same as the lower_rating, but looks good
Oh wait my internet is dying
You see same names same time
But one has the results
And the other one is not updating
i‚Äôll have to investigate more when i‚Äôm back home then, haven‚Äôt heard of this issue
Okay Ty!
If you need anything I will try to answer asap if not contact <@172355677136617482>
looks like your current count is 171
i need to make a fix to how players are counted
the server player count should not count dupes, and it should not reset
yeah thats what i was talking about
after /resetstats players start duplicate
does this command reset player stats?
yea, im making a change to fix it
no, but
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
changing queue name = stats are no longer visible for the old queue
is there a way to import it to the new queue name?
Like taking the stats from the old queue name and adding it to the new queue
/migratestats
also is it intended that canceled matches count towards daily limit?
Perfect thanks
Also I added the map bans
But the veto still doesn‚Äôt work
It does the same thing as before
It just lets captain 1 pick the map
Instead of going through captains ban by ban until 1 map is left
There‚Äôs a daily limit?
it‚Äôs sorta a side effect of the fact that matches receive the unique number upon creation, but it should probably be changed
what‚Äôs ur config (/save)
50 by default (free tier)
TEXMH
Queue configuration saved as: TEXMH
How does premium work? Or is there a place to read about it? Can't find anything on it
you can log into the website and give premium to your server
it just increases limits on players, daily games, and queues
free tier is 500 players, 50 daily games, 3 queues
What is 50 daily games?
It means 50 games per day?
And are the player limitations reset at some point? Or like once we reach 500 players on the leaderboard no new players can join
once 500 unique people queue, the next player will be blocked from queuing
Ahh 50 games / day?
I know premium is 1000 players but what is the daily games increase and queue increase to
Anyway why neatq still not allow payment subscription with paypal?
i just never set up subscriptions
250 games, 10 queues
Couple more questions on this, I know I'll very likely need to purchase premium so want to make sure I understand everything

- Are these restrictions queue based or server based? So each queue can have 50 games a day etc
- Does ./resetstats all reset these limitations? Specifically the max player limit, since it resets the leaderboard

And last thing is there a command for completely deleting a queue? I have a couple test queues that I no longer need
1) Restrictions are server based
2) Technically resetting stats will wipe the player limit (this is unintended and will change), but the games limit does not reset
you can use /endqueue to delete a queue
uhmm
how to paid premium anyway?
im not found on neatq web
log in at https://www.neatqueue.com , goto Dashboard, and select your server
So no matter what I do, eventually I'll have to spend 30 credits a month? I'm running the bot in a community so we'll eventually reach 5000 players, even if we play 5-10 games a day
Plan on resetting the leaderboard every couple months, kind of unfortunate that people who play one game now and don't play ever again will count towards that number
Can i do multi auto ping when it reach 3, 6 , and 9 player queue?
Hey, can somebody help me with one question
I have roles in the discord, and why another roles can't see the details of the message in the bot
I can see this
But, conor is who create the queue only see that
We have the same roles
go to permission settings and follow my setting for your player roles
No work <@401639382567878656> üò¶
Turn this on in your discord settings, image and text menu
<@145305657237700608>
that config doesn‚Äôt have any maps?
How?
How do you get an Authorization token if i want to use the api?
errr, no you cannot
/webhooks generatetoken
thanks
how large is the server?
perhaps the player count should be fixed to not reflect duplicates, but the premium limit should only count players who have queued
where resetting would reset the premium limit
all in all, if you are actively entertaining 5000 players, you should have to pay quite a bit more than the current $30 a month
i‚Äôll have to think about it
is there a command to check how many daily queue i use today?
top of /serverstats info
Hey there I was trying what you said, but I just thought something. If I do like you said, I will have the same player having a different MMR between the 2 queues I want them to queue for, right? For example If Rank A is 1500 mmr, after some games in his rank he gets to 1600 mmr, the problem is he will have 1500 mmr (starting mmr) in another queue, right?
So is there a possibility to have that player from Rank A to be able to queue in another queue with his Rank A mmr?
what timezone 00:00 daily reset followed by bot?
you should have all the queues be named the same if you want their MMR to be the same
so if they hit 1600 MMR, they are 1600 in both queues
but can only queue in the 1600 queue
the daily reset is at 12:00 EST
when the bot posts in <#935731235790139422>
Yeah but then it's all the same queue, isn't it possible to have a way to make a player play in another queue while using the same mmr?
Is there a game you play so I can make an example of what i mean with the ranks? xD
no, when the queue names are different, the MMR systems are totally separate
if you want a system where you can rank up/down between queues, they should be named the same
Mmh okay I get it then
I was just hoping for some elite players of my top rank to be able to queue in the second higher rank while still risking to lose points, since it's just a few people in the "elite" rank and I wanted them to play more
why not just let them queue in the lower rank?
i'm doing it, but the fact is they don't play seriously because they can't lose points in their actual rank
since the mmr is different
they would if you named them the same
it would be their actual mmr
Currently the server that is using the bot is quite small, just over 100 members. But this is a competitive subcommunity of the much larger Polygon game community, 9000 members in the discord. I manage both of these, and soon once we finish setting up the competitive server, where we have this ranked system and we're also getting a team league going, I'll be announcing the whole thing to the entire community. Currently advertising is just word of mouth. 

I understand why you have these packages for player count + games + queue, it makes sense. But for me it does suck needing to pay for stuff I don't need at all. The likelihood of the community playing more than 250 games in a day is very low, but since the community is large I imagine a lot of different players coming in and playing a game or two then never touching it again. Atleast if I cleared stats it should clear from your database as well to not take up space, thus removing from my player count limit
But then can I make people of their rank to be only able to queue in their queue?
you can restrict queues with /rolerequirement
can I send you a pm with a screenshot of how I have them right now? Cause I think there's something i'm missing about the queue names
sure
i think i will go with the route of resetting stats will wipe the premium player count
i just want to ensure that the servers visible player count does not reset
Yeah I got you, so in that case having any of the premium subscriptions would allow me to use the /resetstats all command to reset that player count? Thats fair
Do you know how I can pause a queue, not end, pause?
you can disable queuing with /lock
or when you end the queue, it will give you a config code, which you can /load
And if i create a new queue with the code, the leadership will be saved?
all config will be saved, yes
is there any way to disable /cancel command?
sent you some pms
It does
Like the maps come up
not for that code at least
Queue configuration saved as: AQAJQ
What about this one?
You know what I think might be the problem
I have a linked channel for the current q
And I probably did the map bans command in the linked channel I thought that‚Äôd work but they seem to have different saves
same thing
Does that one have maps though?
nope
What
you can check via /info
page 4
They come up on the actual q though
Like when the q pops the maps come up
As a list
Suggestions on how to fix?
i‚Äôm assuming you configured the map bans for the queue you are linking me
try /unlink in the queue channel
you can‚Äôt /link in a queue channel, but perhaps it was already linked
This channel is not linked!
That‚Äôs what it said
Apparently it‚Äôs not
Must‚Äôve changed it somehow by accident
i need help with queue keep kicking
people for inactivity
Also does the bot add the links? <@145305657237700608>
i will take a look at what‚Äôs up
/timer queuereset
or /timer afk
One of the queues work
We have 2 queues
the image will be shown when the map is picked
First one works with the veto
Yeah but I didn‚Äôt add those links xD
No idea how they got there lmao
someone did, or you loaded a config from someone
Maybe someone else
Pretty cool tho tbf
got it thanks
and how do i add a map selection when doing random team selections
or does map selection happen only in captains?
nevermind i got it
just had to manually enter maps in
which server?
Hi, i wanted to setup the MMR variance in order to avoid boosting but idk if it is possible to do for example : 0 MMR won if between 2 players they are separated by too much MMR like 100 MMR ?
Another question : The age of the account for the anti-cheat system, is about his creation on discord or the time passed after he joined the server ?
Fixed it
All good
you could increase the variance value, check out the calculator to see the effect
discord account creation
where can i find this calculator ?
on the website ?
Another question : the translation project is in progress or some languages are finished to be used ?
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3qtwvlrw8q yes it is in the docs
and yes the translation project is fully working, new languages are easy to add
+ fix translations
Also, the MMR variance cannot be under 100 on your tool so is that means that it is useless below?
you can adjust the calculator ranges
is there anyway to see a list of the queues?
server im operating only has 2 queues but saying it has 3
yes /serverstats info
how do you tell which queues are active?
it would have a channel mentioned next to the name
how do you make one queue use the same mmr leaderboard as another?
Hi, how can we modify points for all users at same time instead of specific players ?
make them have the same queue name
currently you can‚Äôt, best you can do is reset everyone‚Äôs stats with /resetstats
Oh ok
i just wanted to delete points from leaderboards personnal stats
because i don't use it
yea, currently there isn‚Äôt a way to do that
Is there a way to list all players with a specific rank?
Like, discord role?
Yeah, some players want to have a command to see everyone in the roles that are given out for ranks
as an admin you can see, but not as a user currently
<@145305657237700608>
my mmr is 1000 but it wont go down
to what i want it to be
check your /info page 3
wheres this?
i found it
i have them set as 200 starting but theyre 1000 rn
so ihave to reset them all or
how od i do tghat
i tried to reset
it doesnt work tho
js stays the sameunlessi gotta refresh somehing
or somehing with leaderboard?
you need to refresh to see
i been
its just at 1000 on leaderboard
i did /startingmmr set
and refreshed
didnt work
did you reset the players
i gotta do them all individual??
either one at a time, or everyone
idk how to do everyone
i did indiv
/resetstats
okay
and how to remove smeone from leaderboard
that left server
you will need to use their user id to mention them in the command
'<@123>'
ah okay
Hey there, everything works good after our talk! I have another question now tho. I'm planning some sort of soft-reset on my queues after each month, which consists in a -50 points for every player in the queue. Is there a command already which does this, or maybe can you add it?
it‚Äôs in the planned features, i do want to add bulk updating of players, currently you cannot do it
what command
to do it
/resetstats player <@12345>
says a user id specified is ivalid
invalid*
about to get on a flight so i‚Äôll push through the easier features in <#954499196629692486>
that might be one of them
make sure it‚Äôs formatted like `<@12345>`
okay
Thank you so much
do you think you can make it by the end of March? Just want to know so I plan some alternatives meanwhile
not working
and its also asking for queue name option after
queue name is optional
yea it‚Äôll be done
after 10 players join queue it doesnt auto put us in the vc how do i do that
Also, if I use the command /leaderboardconfig monthly toggle:Disabled mode:Rolling, the players stay at their actual mmr and the leaderboard doesn't change monthly, right?
just making sure
also after the queue is done how do i make it so it auto puts everyone back into previous vc
if monthly is disabled, then yes nothing changes
/lobbychannel pullall
and /lobbychannel return
tyyyy
and the kids who left
still not working
someone js joined and it still 1000 mmr when he joined
plz hlep <@145305657237700608>
thank you
how to set starting mmr
it says 200 set
but someone js joined and its 1000
ok last things how to change team names after teams get sorted after we picked all our stuff we wanted it just says our discord names
and the leaderboard thing aint working too
the leaderboard thing isnt working
and for the team thing  still wont work
when you use `/startingmmr` is that a server wide thing or do I have to do that in each queue
<@145305657237700608>
Is there a command to remove a specific number of mmr?
like at the end of a game or just to take 10 mmr from someone outside of a game
if you want to keep the mmr change static you can do `/mmr change set` and then pick a number and set it to static it'll be one of the optional arguments
<@544711857429282826>
Yeah I'm just doing /setmmr it's working
yeah that's the best way to just remove mmr from someone
`/teamnames set`
command to
command to end game and pick winner
you vote for the team in the queue channel that you voted for the map on assuming you voted for map idk what game you're playing
should be above your voice channels
i got it
that‚Äôs a queue config
you can do /set or /add
thanks
Anyone have sample webhook response for when a lobby is created (and when a lobby is completed)? üôÇ
i can send it in a bit
or just use https://www.webhook.site
and test it
Mostly I don't have a test queue setup lol
which I could, but I'd probably wanna just make a separate discord and I'm lazy
https://webhook.site/#!/695c599b-fc6d-4a23-aaee-ce170e355fb3/7051d907-b47b-4b05-acc8-96464fa6c565/1
thank you so much
did you add the "Twitch" field at one point? or am I forgetting
oh wait I'm trolling, ignore me
ok hear me out, would it be a PITA if you added the "twitch" field that included the twitch id/username (from connected accounts for a user)? If it is, that's ok
TL;DR I was planning on using that to call the Twitch API and see if they're live
but I can do it myself spinning up my own bot
remember, neatqueue has presence disabled to lessen the amount of requests
so that info is not available
i do /mmr ceiling to remove the mmr ceiling but it's not removing
and players at or above 2000 are not receiving mmr
its removing when I try it
could it be because the game had already started?
so that part of the process had been started and the player with 2000 mmr had already been decided they would receive 0
yes, when a match starts it gets a snapshot of the queue‚Äôs config
thank you
oh I didn't think presence was needed for that, I think it's only needed if you want to tell if they're "live"
Hi, i didn‚Äôt test it yet but when a queue start, if a player leave after seeing the name of another player that he dont want to play with or against for any reasons when they have to join vocals, is this player lose MMR ? So my question is: Can we forbiden leaving a queue, if not we lose MMR ?
You can make ban for dodge longer, it could help
nah you need presence to check account connections
how are they leaving the match?
you can‚Äôt just leave a match normally
he meant like people dodge match when they see players in queue vc and he wants to add mmr loss for queue dodge
<@145305657237700608> LB chart is empty all of sudden
bot was restarting, still?
it also needed a min to calculate the peak MMR and Streaks
By never joining voice channel when they see others players names
And i wanted to know if we could do MMR loose if a player never join a voice channel
ah makes sense
How can you find the cofig code for your queue
<@145305657237700608>
`/save`
so how can we solve this problem ?
because players can chose players against playing by this way and without losing any MMR
even if i put anonymous queue
<@145305657237700608> is there any problem with the bot? Suddenly we only see 3 players on each leaderboard
Thanks
what queue name
ill think of something
Will this interfere with the queue
now it's fixed
Another question : Is this possible to put specific map when there are 2vs2 players and when its 3vs3 another map but in 1 queue and without asking votes ?
If 2vs2 = specific map 
if 3vs3 = another specific map
etc
This happened few minutes ago when i was testing not joining voicechannel
it can be a way to avoid players to do this but MMR losing is much better imo
and btw time to joining a voicechannel is so fast and idk how to change it
its just cuz you are in test mode
oh ok
without test mode the time to join a voicechannel is around how many actually ?
5 mins default
`/lobbychannel timer`
hi <@145305657237700608> another thing, Many players are complaining that the team random mode doesn't work very well, if the same 6 players make another queue, most of the time the bot forms the same 2 teams, I checked and it happens really often.
Can anything be changed to make the bot less chance to reform the same two teams?
maybe, but then it wouldn't be Random
true
if you have /reshuffle enabled, they can just reshuffle
no i disabled that feature
but if you tell me it's totally random that's okay, I'll tell him it's just bad luck haha
yes, it is random
i think i've found a solution to remove MMR for players non joining voicechannels
i was thinking of putting a long time for players to join voicechannels to avoid queue cancel
and forbiden players joining another queue until they joined the voicechannel
but idk if there is a command multiqueue
i remember there was a command for that before but i don't see it anymore
like this the votes will be available to confirm the winner team
even if the player leave the voicechannel directly after joining
the only thing that can be frustrating is if the player wait for a long time before finally joining
So the fair player will wait too without the possibility to play
yea that would be annoying
i would just auto ban them for a bit
yeah i saw it but this is not enough imo
even if u just increase the timer?
mmhh
but i think the player will do it again even if he knows he'll be banned again for 5 or 10 min whatever
because he doesn't lose any MMR so its free in his mind
he'll prefer wait instead of losing his MMR ranks
but i like the ban idea too
why do not putting both at same time ?
or letting us choose
yea that makes sense
<@145305657237700608> So basically, my suggestion is to make points working the same as mmr + add customization to winstreak: how many games needed and how much mmr/points bonus player will receive
Cause in current state Points are useless
except predictions !
do you have stats how many servers use predictions?
Do i make a feature request or it is fine?
about 33%
oh ok, so maybe you make new stat like mmr and call it like "queue points"
it can reuse the same points system
we have new season starting on Thursday, would be nice if new points + winstreak will be added till that day
Cause for now i need to get json from site, convert to excel, manually copy all i need and use formula to calculate
Hey how do you make it so other people can just scroll through the leaderboard
cuz they cant
`/leaderboardconfig edits`
what is the command to forbidden multiqueue ?
```
/multiqueue will be removed. By default, it is impossible to be in more than 1 match at a time.
However, players are now always allowed to be in more than 1 queue at a time, in case they just want the first match available

```
ohhh
And what happened if we are in a full queue starting ? We disappear on the waiting list of the other queue ?
ok nice
is there a command to adjust the time of banned players from non joining voicechannels or this is a new feature not added yet ?
`/player autoban`
will be changed to `/dodge autoban` when i update
nice ty
How the bot do when there is a tie at voting maps ?
it does a random pick between both choices ?
forcestartsize command cannot be tested in test mode ?
i don't see a vote request appearing
it will after some time if the conditions are met, and auto_start is enabled
Hey is there way to config the queue so that it will only start if at least one player has some role
For context, only some players are able to create lobbies, I'd like the queue only to pop if at least one player with the "lobby_maker" role is in the queue
not currently, no
do you think there is a way to incorporate this concept with the current bot commands?
like some kind of loophole?
there are role requirement possibilities, but nothing that would require only 1 person to have it
Hi, i've tested forcestartsize with all conditions met (auto_start enabled, etc) but it doesn't work in test mode after 5 min so my question is how the vote looks like ? It is supposed to appear automatically like vote maps ? And another question, it is possible to forcestartsize only appear if the number in each side is equal ?
Hey Neatz. Is it possible to kick someone in queue?
or limit amount of special role to join queue?
it appears like a normal vote in chat
and that stuff is configurable by you
you might not even have it enabled
/player remove
i got it well configured
i've checked twice in a row
maybe it is because of test mode
i‚Äôll double check it‚Äôs still working
how much time i've to wait to see it appear ?
5 minutes
which channel ID?
958102196036202616
auto force start is working fine
you have 2 people in the queue?
none actually, but when i tried i was 2 on Team 1 vs 2 on Team 2
in test mode
i retry now
i wait 5 min
yep nothing happened
and in test mode isn't it faster ?
how can we change the time for this vote appear btw ?
save your config and ill try /save
you can't currently, its a static cooldown
because 5 min is quite long to wait
for testing
but its ok when queuing
The config code is : ZMXKE
weird
i've putted between 2 ans 4 players
but on my side i got nothing
i've putted points at 0 with /points startingvalue but i still have 1100 points on my stats on the leaderboard after reset all the server btw
dont specify a queue name
points are not related to queues, so it wont reset
oh so i can reset stats without specify a queue name
yes it will wipe stats for all queues
nice
or just do `/set points`
oh and it works for votes too !
and btw the leaderboard is not traduced yet ?
traduced?
language that still in english
translated?
ah yes
which part is not translated
on the screen all seems to be in english yet
oh the /stats?
Hey <@145305657237700608> 
1) This points will be removed after /resetstats
2) Is it possible to make separate points for each queue?
oh yea forgot about that, it‚Äôs a template image that is used, i‚Äôll need to have it generate the text on the fly
what is the first question? and no, points are a serverwide stat
oh btw, leaderboard ignore roles not removing players from points table
first question was, if i use /resetstats, all points will be removed?
or there is another way to reset points?
so rn i need 3 things:
1) Reset all points
2) Ignore roles work on points leaderboard
3) Customizable winstreak for mmr and points
yea, points are not a queue config so it doesnt ignore
or do /set points
btw i don't get the importance of points ? It's not like MMR ?
points are a separate system used for predictions
oooh
it will be expanded to include other stuff
ok !
is it possible to add "ignore points"?
yea maybe it should obey that
it would be nice
next update it will obey the normal queue leaderboard config
why im getting this error?
try again?
same
im trying this
maybe cause a lot of users?
yea thats why
ill fix
thanks
the command still works
its just the response is too slow
Hey NeatZ could you check why this leaderboard link is not working, please? https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/1043184884212043848/1083057695315198012
does it work in discord?
yeah it does
Hi, idk what /leaderboardconfig shorturl does?
Can we put ratinginname for only a specific role? Like when players reach the last role and continue to win some MMR but there are no more roles to see differences
The command /channel category has a limit of 50 channels created by the bot at same time?
discord categories are limited to 50 channels
creates a short URL like https://www.neatqueue.com/lb/MyLeaderboard
And so if we hit it how can i tell to the bot to go on another one category?
currently it doesn't have an option to switch like that
Mmhh ok so at 50 channels, new players will have to wait to play ?
currently it will just spill out of the category
Oh ok
not a great solution though
Yup but at least players can continue to play
So its just to visualize the leaderboard on website?
it just shortens the url
but yes
normal URL is like https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/1043184884212043848/1083057695315198012
Because i already have an url like this one when i check my stats with statsbutton
Thats why i was confused
the short url isnt visible anywhere in discord iirc
The short url is not visible yes but i‚Äôve got the button to access at it thats what i would saying
I think i didnt get the meaning of the leaderboardconfig short url command yet but anyway xD
could you /save your config and post it
its just a link to the leaderboard
The leaderboardconfig monthly reset all stats every month but can it save up at same time all data to have a historic ?
the normal leaderboard link is very long and ugly
here is an example https://www.neatqueue.com/lb/ProCity
It is reset every first of each month at midnight or something?
And historic has no limit of months on website ?
new month in UTC time
yes no limits to this
Nice
Matchmaking is only for 1vs1 matches ? Or it works too with teams?
any number of teams/team sizes
What can we do against smurf ? I mean is there a way to avoid them ? Or its like impossible to do something to counter it ?
depends on your setup
can use the anticheat to flag them
Yup i was thinking at that idea but even like this i will dont know if those players were legit or not
Maybe if i put the streak at more than 5
smurfing in any game is pretty hard to detect
even harder with neatqueue since it has barely any data
Yeah
Queue configuration saved as: SNZSD
yep its a bug
is there anyway to make it so people dont get banned if they miss queue i get it for bigger servers but mine is just me and my friends
nevermind i found it
it was the player autoban thing
is there a way to set it up so only one player bans out maps instead of all the players but with captains disabled
like i have a random queue but i want only one person on each team to have to ban the maps
no, that wouldnt really make sense outside the context of a small group
ok is there anyway to make it so only the captain bans the maps in a captain queue
yes `/map voting`
this is fixed btw
How i can set be default captain selection?
/teamselection
Can we change the bot pfp? I couldn't find if it was a premium feature. Thank you for your help in advance.
Hi, is there a webhook url example anywhere ?
i've tried leaderboardconfig monthly command to enable it but when i go on the page of them (because i've got 2 leaderboard different) i can see that i've historic to the left but only for one of them, it is normal ? How can we link the command for all leaderboards ?
first one is ok
second one nok
btw i've got month choice on both on discord but not on site
So i can suppose that is a bug on website ?
no its not possible to change a bot's profile pic, the only way would be to host a private instance
the docs have examples of webhooks data
im not following
i've got historic on discord but not on website for both of my leaderboards but only for one
<@145305657237700608> Hey, I'm having trouble removing one of the voting menus. Its not showing up when I attempt to remove it, and I believe it might possibly be a bug. I have screenshots but maybe i'm just doing it wrong.
yea i see you've been hitting an error, its cuz the voting menu title is too long to display in the command, lol
ill have to add a work around, i can remove it manually for now
should be fixed?
Uhh you may be removing the wrong one
oh yea wrong channel
now?
Ayee Fixed tysm! We've had one other issue with the leaderboard link not appearing on the web link idk if you have a fix for that
<@145305657237700608> Thank you so much , I'm the owner on that server , let me just say I love your bot by the way.. I was literally in my head thinking I mistyped something when I tried removing the voting menu haa
what link?
The leaderboard.. basically isn't loading stats for each player.
https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/1077608053492424704/1077612767793655868
It used to before , in all the other queues , and now It's not loading , I'm not sure lol.. It's totally cool though If it can't be fixed I made a channel with the stats button for people to check there too but maybe It's an API issue?
maybe this is a bad choice by me but
you have `/mmr change hidden`
YES I DO LOLOLOLOL
THATS THE REASON ?
I thought It would just hide it from the Queue Configuration Temp Channel only.
Because I didn't want people to judge based on there MMRs lol
nah it will toggle it for the queue
I didn't know It applied towards the leaderboard page
although i realize it doesn't even hide the discord leaderboard?
oops
No It doesn't
Let me show you
It works here
yea i figured that
but it probably should
sadge
Also another bug is that when you Click on the option for Captain Selection as Random , It changes it to vote instead.. It doesn't do randomize.
The weird thing is It works for another queue I have running to test things in -
It's just empty because of no games played or anything.
could you /save your config so i can see this
that config doesnt have the captains vote
For some reason now the options aren't showing now hm
But usually when I select Randomize captains , It enables the vote for captain option Instead.
you have to send the command
Also for some reason now anybody can join the Team Voice Channels.
I don't know what happened loll
check channel perms
But those channels get created randomly after the match setup.
And noone had perms to join , now for some reason they do , Is it because I changed the default name for both teams.
voice channels inherit the perms of the category
Hey!
For players to lose points, i need to write like this?
yes negative values should work fine
Thank you <@145305657237700608> VCs are now private.
Also how do I make it where It shows the captains name as voice channels instead.
`/teamnames captains toggle:Enabled `
the channel names are named after the team always
Thank you!
Also the MVP reward , Was not giving MMR to the player that was selected as MVP at the end of the match for some reason.
I have it turned off now , since I gave up so I toggled mvp off
was it showing them as the MVP in the winner message?
Nope
It just showed the winning team and losing team
probably didnt have enough votes
It does show it in here.
ah, it wont show in that winner message
For example cZ was chosen multiple times but was never given the Extra MMR.
it should still give the MMR though
depending on the configured mvp reward
I even changed the number to 100
To test it out cause usually the mmr set is at 20-30 If you win.
But he only got around the same still lol
Is this actually possible to put /forcestartsize with pair or impair arguments ? Because min and max means that the vote can appear when queue is in 3 vs 2 or something else and thats not fair so the vote shouldn't appear when its impair number of players
It is possible to do role and team queue + balanced by MMR ?
there is an optional only_fair arg
this one doesnt have an MVP yet
hmm it says the MMR was given
Really?
Where does it say that
on my side
since u have mmr changes hidden it wont show in a message
Well there is a game running right now once Its over Ill update u to see if it s good or now
Wait is there a seperate command for mmr changes hidden or is the hide mmr thing the same thing
How can i modify my queue by adding roles ?
its the same
well idk what the other thing is lol
its just `/mmr change hidden`
like /autoroles ?
like that
Damn, people in my queues already found a way to take advantage of the Unfair stuff. The 3 higher mmr players are voting unfair while the others are choosing other team selections, so they always get the best team and win every time üòÖ  Is there a way to create an option for the bot to choose "random" if a team selection doesn't get the majority of votes, or should I just remove the Unfair from it?
`/roles`
ok ! And does it work with matchmaking ?
lol if the vote is 3 - 3, it should randomly pick one option
but yea that is kinda messed up
(it should)
also, the vote should need 4 votes by default, not 3
i think /role is not the right command to do the same queue as above on the screen
sorry /roles
actually i think im wrong
since all the votes are in, it randomly picks
ops sry xD
Ok so it works but the bot says that i've to create a party. It means that we cannot do a roles and team queue where players can join randomly and where they are putted on some roles available until complete ate least a forcestart size vote team or full team <@145305657237700608> ?
Are you sure right now it's not like, for example 3 players vote for "unfair", 2 vote "captains" and 1 votes "random", it actually chooses unfair cause it has the majority?
that would happen, yes
team queue means you have a party that is the full team size
isn't it possible to have the 4 votes option somehow? With the random choice if they're 3-3
even though i'm already thinking about disabling the unfair xD
<@145305657237700608> Can you remove the voting menu in this queue channel aswell
since the vote is at a stalemate, it just randomly picks one
Thank you.
done
I've seen something which could be interesting to add : Roles next to player's name in order to check it up for staff because actually we see nothing about this information after the game is finished even in resultschannel and so we can't compare anything about it with in game roles. So roles can be not respected by some players between what they've chose while queuing and in game.
is there any way to check cancelled matches?
<@145305657237700608> it would be nice if we could check cancelled games somehow and even change their result
<@145305657237700608> is there any way to increase how many votes needed to cancel match?
how its possible? Players tell me that they played this match today, but bot shows yesterday for some reason...
time travel
no, the bot used the old queue message and put the results in there, instead of having to delete the old queue message, send the results, and then resend the queue message
but that is a bit confusing since it does say it was yesterday
got it, thanks!
maybe ill update it to only do this special edit if the message is from today
or include a timestamp at the bottom
yeah would be nice to have actual time of the match at the bottom
The mvp did not show
it hasnt been picked
neat is there a toggle that disables queueing until outcome is picked for a match?
I think I recall this being added but can't find it
`/requeue condition`
<@145305657237700608> do you guys have a rng feature for like agent select
could u explain more
like i would type "/agent" and it would random select a valorant agent
no, but there is /roles and /role
no random option though
what does role and roles do
like in <#915811627855646730>
would that work for champs can we customize it?
yes you can customize via /roles
players can either click Join Queue and pick a role, or use /role
ok up to how many slots?
there isnt really a limit
could i do all 140 champs in league haha
no that wouldn't work
for league, the roles would be more like "Top, Mid, Jungle, ..."
(idk if those terms are right, never played league)
that way each team would have the correct number of each role
ok do you know if they is any bot or if its possible to create somethign like that for league
where if we are 5 stacking
and want to randomly roll for champs
and we can do a command like /champ
it goes and gives us a random one to play
you can use neatqueue to let 5 people queue up for a match if you set /numberofteams 1
only way I can think of doing the random champs is like this
`/lobbydetails set message: Player1: RANDOM[Champ1, Champ2, Champ3, Champ4, ...} \n Player2: RANDOM[Champ1, Champ2, Champ3, Champ4, ...}`
although that would be incredibly verbose
Hello! Any updates about winstreak customization?
Hi, the command /serverstats channelnames players show the total number of players on the server or only those who queued once ?
Hey <@145305657237700608> 
Ignore roles is working on points now?
only who queued once, but it can count duplicates
it should no longer count duplicates
i‚Äôm not sure on a good way to make that a command
wdym?
I need everyone to start with 200 points, +15 win -10 loss
It will work if i do like this?
/points startingvalue value:200
/points change win value:15
/points change loss value:-10
the streak multiplier is a formula, not some value
maybe you can add another command, that will work as value
so if players made X wins in a row, from next game he gains Y mmr\points bonus, until he lose
you can make both winrate like that:
/winrate mmrvalue enabled/disabled
/winrate mmrvalue wins needed
/winrate mmrvalue mmr bonus
/winrate pointsvalue enabled/disabled
/winrate pointsvalue wins needed
/winrate pointsvalue mmr bonus
/winrate formula enabled/disabled
or you can combine both mmr and points
/winrate value enabled/disabled
/winrate value wins needed
/winrate value mmr bonus
/winrate formula enabled/disabled
<@145305657237700608> is there any way to check how many matches were played in queue after stat reset?
Ok, but what ur opinion on winstreak value?
maybe you can even name it bonus mmr/points, so there will be no confusion
i dont think a static value makes sense
This is how FACEIT works (Screenshot from FPL)
i just want smth similar
I keep trying to get the bot to join my server and it wont.
oh btw, bot have tiebreakers for points and mmr?
what do you mean?
in what sense
if 2 or more players have exact same points or mmr, how bot decide who will be higher?
on what, leaderboard?
not positive but its sorta random
random to me, im sure there is a reason
its just however the database indexes the data, whichever is first
is it possible to add tiebreakers?
so whoever won more matches, he will be higher
if they won same amount of matches, then who played more matches will be higher
nah, thats just an arbitrary choice
its not really better in that case
maybe just add this as option in leaderboard config
it just adds useless complexity really, why should more matches mean higher?
first one is more important
Just for example
MMR is 500 starting, 15 for win, -10 for loss. MMR values are static
So player 1 should be higher then player 2 imo
id argue player2 should be higher, they have a better winrate lol
could be
but it should not be random
You can just choose whatever tiebreaker you like more and add it, + add info in docs so everyone know that
I want tiebreakers, cause im giving money prizes in hubs using this bot
So i want to be sure, that if tiebreaker situation happens, i know what the tiebreaker is
If you can add tiebreaker for points and mmr, it would be awesome
im gonna leave it
the odds of there being a tiebreaker are super low
MMR is only rounded when its displayed, in reality it looks like 540.13213131341414515125412512
How do i fix leaderboard showing up blank
when i do /leaderboard
you have matches played?
yea we do
7 matches it was workin but the last game we played we checked the leardboard and its showin up blank screen now
did you change queue names?
even when i have static mmr change?
well no
we did by accident cause diff ques were opening we didnt know wha we was doing
but we stoppped all teh ques made a new one to reset
played  agmae
and when we did leaderboard after it was still blank
so now we just stuck
do `/serverstats info`
the bottom will tell you the queue name
how do i delete all ques that were made
to start freshj
`/outcome cancel` or just delete the channels
hey uh, may I ask for help?
thanks you, the problem is, we accidentally used the /endqueue command and turns out we can't bring it back I guess
the question is, are statistics cancelled by now, and how could I make the same queue as above?
when you end it a queue it should give you a config code
yeah I figured I could use it but I guess someone's deleted it, or it did by itself idk
is it possible to find the config code somewhere else?
no i dont think so
is that your code, WDOMY ?
nope
nah, it didn't work with /load command, it's just a name
yea not the config then
you are out of luck if someone deleted the message\
okay uh
what commands shall I use to create an exact same queue if I may ask?
go through /setup again
when a queue is ended it shows the config code in case you want to same exact settings, other than that its lost
the code is saved, but there are 15,000 codes
so who knows which one it is
are these saved in some kinda logs I could access or you're the only person to see them?
I mean as long as I know the exact time the endqueue command was used
it won‚Äôt show up in the logs :/
the logs just show the command used, by who, at what time
<@145305657237700608> heads up you might get a lot of traffic to leaderboard... starting now üôÇ
link?
and uh oh
Hey <@145305657237700608> 
I have bug, bot doesnt change previous queue message to match result
he just sending new queue message
does it happen always
i assume it‚Äôs kinda rare
first time
players started new match, will check if it happens one more time
but any way to get results from previous match? I dont have stuff channel
or i can just delete previous queue message?
hmm i think I could see it happening if someone joins queue immediately when the message is being updated
your last completed match was 205379, and team 2 won
its possible to fix?
and i can delete prev queue message, right?
yes and yes
great, thanks!
i think i might have a fix at least
it looks nicer too, itll send the new queue message at the same time as editing in the match result
so it looks like the match result is posted above the queue
results in staff channel will be sent even if this bug happens?
correct
<@145305657237700608> same bug happened
also bot didnt send results in staff channel
does it have perms?
added now as separate user, will check
btw i dont think its correct, look at match number that started rn
i dont think 20k matches was added in 1 hour
previous 2 matches that bugged also had number "22...."
leaderboard working fine
it will update after match ends, right?
just tested another queue, bug not happened
what if i add /requeue cooldown, it could help?
probably not
but maybe
ok, i will wait for your fix
btw, /serverstats channelname players still have duplicates
whats that channel's id?
i created new one
1085948111496691772
i updated for you
thanks!
it will not count duplicates, right?
not anymore
you just had an old count
it will update when new player queue, right?
Hi, is that normal than the staffchannel set command well configured do nothing on the channel that i've chosen ?
it will show matches that are played
make sure it has perms
nice one ty ^^
Hey <@145305657237700608> , is there any way to check if i have auto lock enabled?And if its enabled, how to disable it?
hmm looks like its not in /info
which channel
1062402560293621780
it is enabled
Oh, and can you tell me how winstreak formula works?
How i can disable it?
`/lock auto_lock:False `
same with unlock
Thanks
Is there a way to get rid of people on the leaderboard if they‚Äôre no longer in the server?
It‚Äôs just for one person
Triedto reset his mmr to 0 with his disc id but says he‚Äôs not found
you can set @ everyone as a /rolerequirement
or use their ID like `<@132313>`
Second part doesn‚Äôt work
What does the first one do?
Ohh so if they don‚Äôt have @everyone they won‚Äôt be on the leaderboard
Interesting
Yeah that worked ty
Hi <@145305657237700608> , are you restarting the bot? Right now all leaderboards have only 2 players.
yea the bot just restarted, if you have any sort of leaderboard roles/ role requirement, it will need to wait until the bot's internal cache is fully populated
yes we have role requirement, so i wait üòÑ
^ probs just this
restarted for a small bug fix
darn
mbmb
thanks
And how can I see commands in Russian?
currently commands are not translated
<@145305657237700608>
... yes?
How do I do the point system
game
huh?
I appreciate your help in advance. I've looked just about everywhere before coming here, and I'm sure I've just kept looking over it.
**Is there a way to disable the timer before it kicks players out of the queue for inactivity? 
As well as a way to allow players to queue while offline**
Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this feature in Pubobot; while your bot is superior, they still miss a few of those creature comforts. 
Thank you again for the help, love the design of NeatQueue.
there is /timer afk and /timer queuereset
what do you mean queue while offline?
Using PuboBot as an example, you can type: /allow_offline
This will cause players to stay in queue even after the close out of discord.
I believe this should be fixed with /timer command
I must have looked over it as I'm complicating the search using words like, inactivity or offlinemode, etc.
that is the default behavior
NeatQueue does not receive updates for user statuses to save resources
new to using the bot and its telling me "You must vote for Queue#225895 to enter a new queue!" why is that and how do i vote for it
that is the default `/requeue condition`, that in order to join a new match, you need to vote
the winner message is in whatever channel the match was
didnt know that and was testing if the bot worked and deleted the voting option when i cleared the channel
either use /outcome or delete the channel
when the captain selection is set to random
is there a way to get the "are the captains valid" question away?
yes, disable /reshuffle
hi <@145305657237700608> we cannot vote for the winning team, if I press nothing happens
nothing?
nothing
all the queue cant vote
even we (moderators) can't pick the winner
im reverting my last update to fix
trying to decrease the amount of RAM used by the bot, so it doesn't cache all the servers upon startup, only when needed
but seems it got ratelimited in doing so, and your server is waiting
ok, can you let me know when I can try again?
okay, it works
I guess the leaderboards will come back up to date in a bit, right?
yea, that was fixed, but had to revert
i have a better idea tho
trying again üòÑ
excuse me <@145305657237700608> , i already setting my config team pick only balanced and captain mode but it still show this
you need to modify /teamselection
Excuse me
I have this problem when i set the elo in two different channels, the map veto only appear in one channel. What should i do ?
two different queues?
Yes its a separate queues
each queue has its own config
about this issue, i set the queue on channel on other
but in this section always keep showing the queue
huh?
I want to delete queue message in admin-ivcl section and keep it queue message on queue-ivcl
i'm worried if i use delete queue message, queue message would be delete in all sections
no, queues are channel specific
just /endqueue
is will be affect to queue-ivcl?
no, thats a different queue
getting a permission error suddenly, had no issues before

neatqueue has all perms in server channel & also has a "bot" role that has all perms.
and in the category where the neatqueue bot is in, it has all the perms
it must be missing it somewhere
the queue that's made in the category isn't "synced" with it's parent
but that's most likely by design, so that people who aren't part of the queue cant join it
is there a way i can add a "bot" role to that?
what do you mean?
it's not synced with the 10mans category, and it doesn't include neatqueue or the bot role
is there a way to include that when this channel is made?
this is a channel the bot made?
the text channel specifically where players vote on maps/bans etc
that is strange
the bot specifically gives itself perms for the new channel
these are the 2 only 2 perms it has set for it self
and it's not even the "neatqueue" role it's the "neatqueue" bot itself
i mean
user
yea it wouldnt be the role
those are the perms I expect to see
the other perms should be Bot perms
so maybe the category has them disabled or something
I have ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù marked as ‚Äúx‚Äù on manage channels
But I have ‚Äúneat queue‚Äù role set on green checks for every perm
And it was working fine last week
Someone pinged me saying it stopped working yesterday
hmmm well i havent changed anything regarding these perm checks
If I remove ‚Äúbot‚Äù and ‚Äúneatqueue‚Äù roles from the channel category will it follow server permissions?
would this work on paper?
i've removed the bot & neatqueue role from the channel category as an attempt to make it follow server perms
Im not totally sure, discord perms are confusing to me as well
When starting a match, the bot will check that it has all the perms that it should have
ok thanks, i'll try this
D: stil broken
you can try impersonating the bots role and see if you can create channels in that category ?
i can
but it seems like roles don't matter
i readded the permissions to the channel category
and it was able to make the text channel btu not the voice channel
i gave up
gave neatqueue admin perms
and it works now
idk what happened, bc it was working perfectly be4. maybe one of my mods did something
yea, perms are frustrating for sure
thanks for the responses tho
amazing bot, love this thing
appreciate it!
hey so i just recently downloaded this bot and i used the /startqueue command and did it all
is there a way to properly test it without people, or start a queue without making me do it all over again
like how do i queue, once ive set up all the settings, for example made it 5v5 with 2 teams only
to test you can use /test
also im guessing theres a way to make it so people dont vote, which is the more specific/customizable option when first setting it up
for like captain being random or picked
and stuff like that
yes you can do /teamselection and /captains selection
what commad shoud i use for transfer statistic's from a user to hes new discord account?
currently there is no command for that
is there a way to make a leaderboard for two different queues?
cause i have two different queues just want to make separate leaderboards for each
yes, just name the queues different
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
aah ok thanks youre so helpful btw
is there any feature to ban agent/hero vote?
is there anychance we can fix this i'm having trouble on this
you'll have to either fix the category perms or give the bot admin
tysm
thank you!
hello, i just intalled NQ to my server, can everyone start a que with a trigger command? if yes where i can set it up?
no, only staff can create a queue
when you start a queue, its runs forever in the channel
Has the bot been a bit slow for anyone else the past few days?
what have you noticed?
Its taking a bit to take players in and out of VCs and set up channels when queue pops
Once it even deleted the channel after canceling a match before it could move everyone out, I think its a 15 second timer for when a match is canceled right?
now that im looking at it, seems like it always deletes before moving people out?
let me reorder those steps
Thats not the behavior that I've seen in the past, it would always move everyone out to the original channel, then delete
But even then, it takes sometimes like 30 seconds or more for the bot to create the voice and text channels and move everyone in
Its not too bad, but slower than before
nothing really intensive happens when a match starts, so it must be at the mercy of discord's rate limit
im not too sure
is there a way to disable map selection? i just want it to be based on map voting and not selection
you mean based on map bans?
yea i want it to be based solely on map bans
just add more map bans
if you add 100 map bans, itll stop when it hits 1 map left
Would we be able to get it so we can limit the leaderboard to people that have a minimum of 5 games played?
How come this pops up after the map veto is done?
Like the choice between ascent, ascent and random. Just shouldn‚Äôt be there
you probably added ascent twice
Nope
Like in the map bans it‚Äôs all perfect
But then map selection comes up for some reason
Like you can see it‚Äôs fine in map bans as they banned down to ascent. Like it should be finished then
i can guarantee you have it added twice
In map lists?
map bans show unique maps since it combines map bans between all game modes (you probably dont use game modes)
map selection does not do this
check /info page 4
Fairs I‚Äôll have a look
Also how do I make it so it‚Äôs a fixed amount of elo for a win/ loss?
How does the current elo even get calculated as well actually?
`/mmr change set amount:25 static:True `
its based on a pretty common elo formula, with a few tweaks to account for your MMR vs your team's MMR
to tell if you carried / got carried most likely
Ah ok
Thanks
Also this +25 for win and -25 for loss
Anyway I can do a set elo for a win and set for loss
Different numbers
`/mmr change set amount:25 loser_mmr:20 static:True `
Legend
Cheers
the channel doesn't show the queue message to join and leave
how can I make it visible?
it just shows the "Starting queue setup!" and nothing else shows up
the bot is missing perms to send messages in that channel
the bot isn't missing perms to send messages in that channel
it actually sends the message but doesn't show the thing with the buttons to join and leave the queue
what message can you see?
For some reason people can queue without voting on the winner of the previous game
Wasn‚Äôt like this the other day and don‚Äôt think I changed anything
Is there a command to make sure they can‚Äôt queue if the game hasn‚Äôt been reported yet? <@145305657237700608>
`/requeue condition`
the default has always been Must Vote though
Yeah
Idk why it‚Äôs letting them queue without it being reported
Wait
Do they just have to vote and then they can queue? Or does the game have to be fully reported for them to queue?
just vote
I‚Äôm gonna switch it to winner selected
Thanks
how do i get out of test mode
`/test`
oh lol ty
Im unable to queue for a new match due to it saying i need to vote for a previous match. there is no option to vote for that match anymore what should i do
<@145305657237700608>
where is the option?
You must vote for Queue#221447 to enter a new queue!
i keep getting this message when trying to queue for a new match but i cant go back and vote for that match since its closed
wdym closed
its cancelled since it was already voted for
try now
Sorry i should've clarified its in one of my Universities servers
should be fixed, somehow the match had a result but didnt get cleaned up, very strange
I'm still getting the message that i need to vote for a previous match
now?
Would deleting that match work?
thats what im trying at least
its not working still?
Nope
ok NOW
Still telling me i need to vote for that match before queuing üò≠ does it track the discord ID?
ok now it is fixed
so the match wasn't played right? but it was cancelled?
It was played but I didn‚Äôt vote and then it was cancelled after
IT WORKED
We have others in the discord with the same issue his Discord is Ya Boy Troy
#4949 he has the same issue with the same match
its not a per-user issue so they should be fixed too
Thank you!
np, no clue how that happened, will have to look into it
Can i ask what you had to do so i can explain it to the others how it happened
idk how it happened, its some issue on my end
when a match is cancelled, its supposed to be deleted, but somehow it didnt happen
Okay cool thanks
Currently have an issue where I modified one of the results, and it changed the leaderboard, and then I reverted it, but it keeps adding games onto the leaderboard
so even though only 4 games have been played, the leaderboard has some people with 6 games now
Is there any way we can reset those stats or sync them with the only queue that's left ?
Hi is there a way to balance modes so all modes get played?
there are 4 modes in our game and 1 got picked 3 times
its not synced?
not currently
Nah its not. Well at least last time I checked and it was like 30 seconds after I deleted em all except the one I wanted to keep
Still not synced. Still showing 2925 games played.
ok thank you
i do see 2925 games though
the only way you can is via custom voting menus
Makes sense, yea we've been trying it. Appreciate the help and thx for the bot
im not able to reproduce, any more info?
<@145305657237700608> Now when our queue reaches the 10/10 it doesnt pop?
lol why is your server facing issues
Not sure lol
We get the queue full and now it doesnt assign teams and send us to map voting anymore
whatever error you are hitting is some sort of issue with the Discord API wrapper library that NeatQueue uses, ive posted the question for them to see
if the next queue doesn't work, reinviting might fix
Ok thanks we'll try that
the bot is trying to check its own permissions, but cant find itself in the server <:TE_Shrug:856060385433616384>
which makes no sense
i see it worked though
<@145305657237700608> is there anyway to control how much elo a specific elo receives?
you can modify the /mmr change
but not per role like your feature request
Ok thx
only captains can vote for winner selection right?
and how can I disable the winner message?
if you disable the winner message, you can't select the outcome
`/voteforresult value:False `
no, the whole team can
and what about the message that asks for the team members to vote if the captains are valid
can I disable it?
so the captains are selected randomly and no one has to vote if the captains are valid or not
I am unsure, so the game that has the problem, team 2 won, if I then modify it to team 1, click cancel/revert and then modify it back to team 2, the results for team 1 stay on the leaderboard, so I presume it‚Äôs the revert button that is having the problem
yea, disable /reshuffle
ok, thanks for the details
hmmm those steps didnt work for me, the stats are as expected
I bought 5 premium credits yesterday but I deleted the discord server and made it again, now I don't have the credits anymore
is there any way I could get the 5 credits back to use them on the new discord server?
the people using the bot were pissing about with the votes when the game finished so it had 5 votes for each team to win and then zion manually changed the score
if that would change anything
sure I can transfer them
ill keep trying lol
wait, lemme send you the transaction ID
its alright, i have the two servers
you should have the premium now
thank you, could I also get the premium role here?
weird it didnt give  you it automatically, was it bought through your account?
ah you joined the server after that, nvm
Yeah because there were 2925 games played throughout 13 different queues but I deleted em all and I kept the only one we are using atm, thought it would've reduced the game count to the queues matches itself
nah, its the count for the entire server's history
when I try to vote for the winner it says that I need to vote the mvp before voting the winner but someone else already voted the mvp and I can't vote it anymore since the button gets deactivated
what match number
I'll just disable the mvp vote, no worries
id rather see whats happening, havent heard of this
wait let me try it again then
when the MVP is picked and the buttons are disabled, that check shouldnt matter
it also lets me vote 2 different match mvps
and the mvp that gets voted for 2nd is the one who gets more mmr
match number 230881
you are allowed to change your vote
is there a command to revert a match (due to false voting)
`/outcome`
i put the match number but it says

Could not find the match channel. Perhaps it was deleted?
if you deleted pick a winner and the channel was deleted, then the result wasn't counted
the result message is in the channel, it should still remember it
whats the match number?
230940
that channel seems to be deleted
what message are you talking about?
try now
i think I see the issue
it worked thank you :D
we just reverted all the games so we can reset the queue so there are no games played at all
but all the extra losses are still on there lol even though there are 0 games played in the queue
just do /resetstats
ye its just now we have to somehow recreate the games that were played
is there anyway we can do that without the players being in the vc
you can manually modify stats with /set and /add
yeah just the mmr wont be perfect
but it should be good enough
i guess you reset someone's stats and then tried to modify match results? which that doesn't work
cuz if someone has no stats at all, it doesn't know how to modify them
ok well we reset the whole leaderboard and are trying to manually add the scores back
when i refresh the leaderboard though it is still empty
what queue name
Valorant Closed
I see Zero has stats for queue name Valorant, not Valorant Closed
in  Student Hub
yeah we have two, we reset the closed one
valorant is fine just having a problem with valorant closed
ur typing it in the Valorant Closed channel?
a different channel we linked to that one
type /info, what queue name does it say
i need help
oh, it‚Äôs changing by 0
i screenshotted the wrong bit sorry lol
how do i do something like this
/setup bro
which?
read them bro and decide üòõ
./load UCQRR
I just want to create something like this
Yeah, type /load UCQRR
I think that should work
i see
currently if the player has no stats in the system, they are skipped
have them queue first
can i go in vc to explain?
i think i am explaining it badly lol
nah its cuz what I said, you reset their stats so they have no stats to modify
I can change it real quick
if we have 4 games played, and we reset the stats
what would be the easiest way to re add them to the system
All extensions have been reloaded
try now
is there a way to have set scores influence point gain/loss?  like winning 4-3 gets less points than winning 4-0
How do I make it so my mods can drag people in the queue vc‚Äôs? Currently shows it‚Äôs locked for them and they can‚Äôt drag people in or out of the vc‚Äôs the bot creates for the queues
I have them added as staffroles
not currently
thats a discord perm
staffroles don't have any extra perms, it just gives overrides for NeatQueue admin commands
Hi, it is actually possible to do multiple autoroles when joining the server ?
But they can drag from any other vcs
just not the vc's that the 10mans bot creates
that should depend on the category perms i think
i‚Äôm not sure, the bot doesn‚Äôt touch perms for manage members
ah yeah i got it sorted ty
Also actually xD
It won‚Äôt let everyone use the /leaderboard command
Only admins for some reason
How can I change it so everyone can use /leaderboard
what does it say?
Doesn‚Äôt say anything
Just doesn‚Äôt let them use /leaderboard
Like it doesn‚Äôt come up as a command when they type it
Is there a way to change a queue without stopping/ending it, so I want the leaderboard to still be the same, just tweak the settings of the queue
that would be a server config then
check your servers integrations
yea all queue settings are changeable
just type / to see what‚Äôs available or https://docs.neatqueue.com
im not sure how to go back into them without putting /endqueue, that would wipe the leaderboard for previous games
wait, if i make it the same queue name and do /endqueue, change the queue with /setup will that keep the leaderboard the same?
and won't wipe the stats of previously played matches
no it won‚Äôt
but also, there‚Äôs no real point in doing /setup again
so i have to change the queue by doing /endqueue then /setup?
... what, thats the exact opposite of what im saying
So after the queue is full, how do players actually join a lobby in game
the bot will create the appropriate channels and wait for everyone to join
Ok, but let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs a Valorant lobby, how do they actually join a party/custom in Valorant
someone will need to make it
Ohk üëç
Thanks
Also what firmst should the Valorant Username be in
It is showing some error
huh?
username + tag
Hey, Whats the name to create a Queue for CSGO/CSGO2? Says "Valorant, Overwatch, Rocketleague ect"
Because i want for the vote maps to appear the maps of csgo
you will either have to make your own config, or load someone elses
so go through the setup, name is whatever you want, then add the maps with `/map add`
Is there a way to make sure that players who have a dodger in their queue get prio on the next queue? I believed it was that way by default, but I‚Äôve been getting reports that lead me to believe otherwise
Hey we are trying to use the new votingmenu add command to make a map veto system
we use this command and it does what we want technically, but is there any way to have options removed once they are picked?
so someone cant choose the same option twice
adding options_variable Map Ban fixed it
^ but map bans are already built in
via /map
ye we did that instead it works better thanks
is there any way we can seperate the teams into vc before it does the bans?
yes `/voicechannels moveteam when:After Teams Created `
thanks mate appreciate it a lot
a player was on 1911 elo and got randomly mmr reset frome the bot?
i would need more info
what info you need
please confirm in your /logs that nobody modified the user's stats
done
no one did something in /logs
what that means "player inside MMR treshhold"
that is `/autoroles`
the normal queue is here
and now the bot is creating the queue channels on top of all categories
this bug happens randomly, and it hasnt happened in over a month, restarting to fix
<@145305657237700608> DM'd you, we're not friends, assuming you have a filter for that.
<@145305657237700608> Is there a way to ask the bot to show the rematch in the match results
One of our queues had map selection on before we enabled map voting and now it priorities map selection over bans
is there anyway to fix this?
wdym it prioritizes
like to indicate that match was a rematch?
So initially we had it where it would just display all the valorant maps + random and you would vote and it would just select that map. But then we made it so there is map bans instead, and I manged to make it work on a new test queue, but on the queue where the map selection was initially enabled, i cannot manage to switch it to map bans
I kept using this command, and it didnt seem to override it, idk if thats the wrong command
The system goes 
- map bans (toggle via /map bans)
- map selection (toggle via /map selection)
`/map voting` just changes who can vote in those votes
so this should fix it?
for a 7 map pool
yes, each team will ban 3 maps, the last will be auto selected
if thats what you want
and then I will need to disable /map selection?
or should it be fine now
no actually, it will just be auto picked
anytime a voting menu has 1 option, it auto picks it and skips the vote
it would even work if you set it to 1000 map bans since it will stop at 1 map
is there a way to remove/reduce the forcestart cooldown
Hey, I got some questions/suggestions, cause I'm not sure if you're working on it already.
1) Is the command to remove a fixed amount of mmr to an entire queue ready yet?
2) Is there a command so you can reset the win-loss record without resetting players mmr?
3) Is there any chance I could see players who didn't play any game in a queue inside the leaderboard?
not currently, its a non dynamic value
1) Yes, /set and /add now can apply to entire roles
2) Same as above ^
3) No, players must have a game played to show up
Is there info on how mmr is calculated after wins/losses?
how do i change the mmr threshhold
threshold?
yh this
thats /autoroles
but i set mmr ceiling to 3000 and someone was on 2000 and this happened
that would be strange, u sure they were at 2000 MMR?
yes, me and pix got ssl removed
is it because 1 role has a hideen maximum range of mmr, so then after you pass the hidden maximum range of mmr even if it says 3000 as the ceiling you lose it
2) wait what's the command again? xD
3) want me to add it to suggestions or will that never happen?
`/add or /set` lol
role has a maximum range?
well i dont know but thats the only thing that would make sens as to why it removed the role
Yo, I always want Team Selection -> Captain. How do I do that? I dont want to vote for players pick or random etc.
Should be in team selection
did you queue in a different queue that has different autoroles?
`/teamselection`
Thanks bro ‚ù§Ô∏è
<@145305657237700608>
Is there a Premium Bot vs. Credit Pro Bot?
We had the same problem some players loseing elo randomly
huh?
they didnt lose mmr, just lost their autorole
This rematch. Srry i was sleeping
sorry, what are you asking?
To remove the rematch thing
oh /rematches
Okok
is there a way to combine leaderboard with different ques ?
you just need the queues to have the same name
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
can u restart the bot?
buggin?
the bot is creating channels in weird positions in discord
yea, restarting
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to split the vc and the game channel into two seperate categories
right know , when we cancel a game via buttons after a game or click  "team 1 , team 2 or tie" the elo is bugging and the players get a whole reset back to 1000 elo..
i mean if we change the result after the players voted
hmm ok let me try that out
so let teams be made, vote for winner, then cancel, then select winner?
i think i got it
thanks for the steps, i was able to reproduce and fix, will restart soon
Hi! I toggled the monthly leaderboard options and then it reset the entire leaderboard on the website. Is there anyway to get back the old leaderboard?
im assuming you see the old stats in the All Time section?
nope completely reset
its all blank currently
but on the server it still shows the stats just not on the website
oh strange, let me take a look
whats the URL?
https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/1069515813922541578/1069555082636558386
and you can refresh in discord?
oh i just checked the leaderboard on discord and its all blank also
hmm that is strange
yeah it is
is there anyway to revert it back to the old leaderboard? if not its ok but yeah
you should be able to just disable monthly
im checking out why you cant see it though
I've voted on top.gg page and i still can't see the stats or leaderboard.
what server?
https://discord.gg/aGMRH3Xe
did you vote this month?
not seeing it
I've done it like 10 minutes ago
Is there a way to get more precise stats for games played, mmr distributions for specific queues? We have two different queues and wanted to measure activity.
So what I am supposed to do?
ill override it, one sec
try now?
not really, if you are into data analysis you can fetch all the data through the API
Yup it's working now
alright ty
hi its me the guy thats actualy gonna use the api

how do i generate an api token? the documentation just has a blank section on it with a link that goes nowhere
very true
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=webhooks-generatetoken
the API is not well documented currently, just reach out in my DMs for whatever data you want
alright thanks thanks
but overall, you can get all the playerdata for the server, as well as in depth stats for each match
yeye
how well does '/queuetype matchmaking' work for a smaller community? As in, are matches mostly fair and just based on MMR (teams average mmr close to matching most games), players don't get stuck in queue, etc

Can you still easily forcestart with this queuetype?
And by stuck in queue I mean if 10 players are in queue (games for my queue are 5v5), but there is a wide range of MMR between these players, will the game still automatically start, or will it just wait to find a more balanced match?
yes you can still forcestart
the matchmaker will attempt to create a match every 15 seconds, and it will increase the threshold for a "fair" match every cycle
which is the `/matchmaking leniency`
Okay thanks
Whats the default value for /matchmakaing leniency ? Or do you have a recommendation for what it should be set to for players to find matches quickly?
its 15 by default
not sure if its a great value honestly
Okay so essentially every 15 seconds it would increase the range by 15 mmr. I'll definitely increase that for my case
yup exactly
Perfect thanks again üòÑ
<@145305657237700608> Is it possible to have it show who's in the queue still using matchmaking?
yea you can disable /anonymousqueue
its enabled by default with matchmaking
Ah I'm blind didnt see that, ty
Hey, I have a huge problem atm, I manually removed a few mmr points to a couple of players, and for some reason their role has been totally removed. I've got the autoroles on, but they didn't drop below the mmr quota for their rank. Is it a bug?
did you use /set or /add?
used /add mmr *user* -20
it happened 3 times already, and I need to figure this out, since I'll have to manually remove a certain number of points to every player at the end of the month as a "soft reset", but i'm scared it will remove everyone's role
worse case you do `/autoroles refresh`
although this seems strange
is it everytime?
it happened 3 times in two different queues tho
and never happened before, i remember i made some tests before
yeah, i just made another try and it disappeared from another player
oh i was just able to reproduce
let me take a deeper look
ah yup, i see why, im dumb
it treats it as if they have -20 MMR temporarily, will fix now
also while adding points btw xd
should be fixed, if you wanna try
i tried as well
ok now we try ty
we are on the same server üòâ
i figured lol
now it works perfectly
cool, thanks for the find
are there points for beta testers? üòÇ
uhhh hmmm
is there a way to make the bot notify people they have been removed from the queue due to afk
okay so: a player did not vote for the result and now is banned fromn queuing, how do i fix that?
It says he has to vote before queuing up again
<@145305657237700608>
they cant vote?
Hey, how does it work with the points gained and lost between these players? Why do some higher mmr players lose the same amount of points as someone who is 800mmr below here?
the game is finished and there is no vote anymore
There was a win message
I have already tried clearing the queue, canceling the match, canceling the queue and setting up a new one, banning and unbanning the player
what match number?
230142
ah its an old match
let me fix it up
should be fixed, there was a recent bug fixed but that match was before the bug
Is there a way to fix it myself or should I contact you again if any other players still have the bug?
Oh and thank you so much
contact me, but it *shouldnt* happen again since the fix
hey i was curious if there is a way to have separate queues for the same mmr system or to have the same queue in multiple different chats? basically i was looking to have a rank system where players get a role (ex. Rank B) after hitting X mmr which unlocks a chat for specifically players of that rank.
yup just name the queues the same
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
oh wow solid
thanks!
would i then do just a basic setup with the same name or would i have to do the full setup?
i assume you want the configs the same so just do /save, and /load the copy the config to other channels
you can set up all the autoroles in one queue, then just copy them all
ok sweet thank you
/help documentation not working?
im seeing the command work
i cant get it to work either
page 404 not found when clicking doc link
also when doing /set win 0. player stats and leaderboard do not change ?
ah the website, ill look into it
you specified the user?
using role
i have fixed it xD user error, sorry.
no worries!
having an issue with the bot losing permissions
even tho it had perms and was working before
Error code: DGESK
yea, the bot was unable to create the voice channel
it has full perms on server and the category
it must be missing it somewhere though
category has full perms where the queue is started under
idk how its missing perms when its basically an admin on the server
role permissions?
its hard to know, but that error came from discord
oh i know that its probably a discord thing
discord perms are a nightmare
yup you are telling me
has all perms enabled on second half of perms sections too
gave full admin perms works idk
lol, its so hard to find
unfortunately the error messages aren't any help, just "Forbidden"
Hey, the website that hosts the documentation on the bot is currently down. Do you happen to have a copy of the commands and what they do anywhere?
you can see them all in discord if you just type /, ill check the status again
I used /clearqueue and now the queue isnt going to the bottom of the channel after someone types like it usually does <@145305657237700608>
What do I do lmao
Nvm I just loaded the config and changed name and changed it back and it worked
Bit busted tho what should I do in future
its an unrelated issue to your queue, havent been able to find the cause yet
Hi, there's a player who got banned but he's still on the leaderboard. Is it too late to remove him?
easiest fix it set @ everyone as a `/rolerequirement`
or you can /resetstats player using their ID
Ok thanks worked üôÇ
help <@145305657237700608>
sorry for tagging
you'll probably need to tell him what you need help with lmao
nvm i fixed it
my bad
When making a queue, how can I set the team sizes for each team to different amounts?
that is not supported currently
Gotcha. I was honestly just wondering how these people made it this way
Unless I'm thinking of this completely upside-down
this is /roles, but the teams are still the same size
in that example, each team is 1 Goalkeeper, 5 Field
Ah, I see. Okay, got it. So I set the team size to 6v6 in this instance, and I use the /roles command if I want to separate them in that way?
yup exactly
I see. Thank you.
I hate to keep asking the same questions, it just feels like I'm asking to be spoon-fed the answers which is basically what's happening right now.

I still can't figure out the sequence to make each role have different amounts. I originally thought it would be the setup or startqueue command, set it to 2 teams of 6 players each, then setting the roles to Field and Goalkeeper. Am I missing something, or do I have the whole sequence wrong?
I'm sure it's an easy solution lol I just can't figure it out, I suppose.
it should be like `/roles Goalkeeper,Field,Field,Field,Field,Field`
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to make the channels not be deleted after the game has reported the winner
no there is not
Lord. I guess I'm too dull to guess that lol.
Thank you
how do I access a ranking of all players ?
say I do a ranked que
report the winner
where can players see the ranks?
<@145305657237700608>
Figured that one out, how do I make a 'join que/leave que' button show up?
you need to start a queue
i setup a que
is there anyway to summon the button ?
make sure the bot has perms for the channel
itll pop up
which commands will summon it I mean
they will automatically pop up when you start a queue
you can refresh with /clearqueue
I have a few more questions
Is there a way to randomly assign 1 out of the 4 players from the popped que to be the required 'outcome' reporter after the que terminates?
And my second question is can 2 pugs run simultaneously without messing up the stats/leaderboards
no, the winner vote will be a majority vote
yes there is no limit to concurrent games
tyty
is there a simple command for players to vote ?
no commands, players dont need commands
so say 4 players que, the game ends, team 1 wins
you can test your queue with /test
ah ok ty
and how do I cancel test que mode
and reset stats for the actual que
just /test and /resetstats
Hello <@145305657237700608> 
Can you add tiebreakers to points and mmr leaderboards?
Cause i have 3way tie, and people just lose money cause bot dont have proper tiebreakers
can u just set higher winrate = higher place?
Hey <@145305657237700608> 
After reverting match results using staff channel, points not revert to correct state
i saw you're able to set your ign with the bot but how do you view peoples ign? and is their a way to make the bot change a users discord name to their uplay once teams are created or even when the queue vc is made
is there a !promote cmd ?
to ping a certain role that the que is almost full
and can we switch commands to ! instead of /
I'm not seeing any maps when i do /map remove
no there isn‚Äôt a way to check IGN on demand currently, it‚Äôs just when teams are made. also no way to nickname using it
yes /need
you have them added?
do you think that's something you may add in the future. it could be convenient to do /ign and @ the player to see their name if they've added one
yea for sure, although would need to be a different command
worked, just didnt show in the que channel
all good
can i set a lot of autopings for different roles + queue sizes?
When would the monthly mmr reset occur?
not currently
midnight UTC
how do i get neat queue to show names of everyone in queue
disable /anonymousqueue if that‚Äôs on
hey can we get a way to show people who never played a game in the leaderboard without being forced to add a game played to everyone?
Is there a way to check how many games in total have been played in a certain queue?
Also
Is the bot meant to do this?
It sent it about 10 times in the space of 3 minutes
not currently, it would be nice to add a customization for that
yea it‚Äôs cuz people are clicking the button
can u allow free unlimited games
ummm, no probably not lol
<@145305657237700608> can u pls tell which perms are missing
is there a way to make it so that you gain less elo the more u go up
cuz 2000 elos gain 30 when they beat like a 700 elo
<@145305657237700608>
change the /mmr change variance
make sure your mmr change isn‚Äôt static
what is the recommended amount
i like 1600 that‚Äôs the default
<@145305657237700608> how to reset the points
use /set points
how to configure it for valorant?
how do i get premium and how much is it
you can use the code in <#1068605714098049054> or make your own
How to fix this? I already setup the permissions?
on the website if you login (you already have premium)
<@145305657237700608> if you ended a queue by using /endqueue, how do you get it started again
with the same data
`/load` with the config code
what about the player stats
player stats are never gone
just match your queue name with the old name
how do we remove the 'are the teams valid' vote
disable /reshuffle
how does the random team selection work?
i do /teamselection but it gives no options
im getting an error when I use this command, trying to see how many games we've played today
i see that, i'll add a fix tomorrow
Can somebody help me on how i can do this?
`/requireign`
Is there a way to check how many games in total have been played in a certain queue?
`/serverstats info`
Also it still won‚Äôt let people use the /leaderboard command and I‚Äôve no idea why
is it hidden?
Idk what you mean by that
like the command cant be seen
How do I make it so it‚Äôs not hidden?
Oh I get you
Yeah I think it is hidden
Also this just comes up when I used serverstats info
NeatQueue is restarting, please wait 1 minute and try again!
ah right, forgot to change that
that means the command failed
but since the bot isnt fully up, it sends a bad error message
Fairs
if a command is hidden, that is do to your configuration in the server's integration settings
Ah ok
Is there a way to share a leaderboard across 2 separate queues?
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
This fixed now? Or will it not be working for a good while
should be i think
thank you <@145305657237700608>
As far as I know, there is no way to currently have an admin fully control starting and stopping of queues right? Stopping, you can choose outcome but for example: 

If I had a filled queue, 20/20 people, the queue would automatically pop and start doing the voice channels, etc. Is there an option to have this be admin controlled only? Say, 60 people are in queue, admin says "starting game voting" and clicks a button or sends a command that then allows the queue to pop
(responded in DMs) but no, this is not currently a thing
is there a way to see how many games have been played in ur server for the day
yes in /serverstats info
how does decay work for neatq, is it based on if you play a game or only if you are in q within the timeframe?
you need a game played to reset the decay cooldown
can someone explain me neatqueue api?
tool
Unexpected error occured
Join the Support Server for more information!
Error code: YSWKR ?
Any idea
<@145305657237700608>
was it only with 1 person?
nah we had 3 people
like were just trying stuff out think we fixed it
Hey <@145305657237700608> , queue closed auto again, can you delete /lock commands?
Hello <@145305657237700608> 
This feature working only for mmr?
should apply to all leaderboards
not working on points leaderboard
yes, it wont show on that one
points are not a queue config
same with MVPs
it would be nice to add minimum games for points leaderboard as well
if its possible at all
cause i have around 60-70 active players in queue, but in points leaderboard it shows around 200 people
it would be nice if they disappear from leaderboard after /resetstats
ok, i can make it work tomorrow
is there an example of how the brackets look when you create a tourney
Hello <@145305657237700608>
I want to show the MMR on names in my server and I tried to configure the command but looks like it doesn't work, Nobody has his mmr next to his name on the discord, do you have a solution? Thanks üôÇ
ill get one
what did you try?
https://www.neatqueue.com/bracket/505102060119916545/Testing
I tried the command /ratinginname toggle => active and then /ratinginname format => same as default setting
it should nickname when people join the queue
are we able to edit them for example creating groups, or adjusting seeding ?
not currently, its a pretty much unused feature so it does not have much going on
seeding is based off the teams average MMR
I see only reason im asking is because im thinking of hosting a tournament and since the bot itself works perfect for me, the tournament bracket would have been a plus when it comes to hosting them. keeps everything close within each other.
yea i get you
keep getting an error whenever i join queue
yup i saw that, fixing one sec
i‚Äôm also fairly new to this bot and have a couple questions
does the leaderboard only stay until the queue is ended?
and is there a way to automatically set the elo gained/lost after a game
player stats are never deleted unless you specifically do it
and you can use `/mmr change`
i was messing around with it a little last night but the leaderboard would only show in the queue, but when i ended the queue there was no leaderboard
right yea, the leaderboard needs an active queue
you can have any number of different stats systems, so it needs the queue to refer to
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
you shouldnt really ever end a queue
even after the game is already played?
so make a new queue for every game?
no, queues dont end automatically
check out <#915810764277817354>
i created it over a year ago
<@145305657237700608>
Can you make my own bot for money?
Like this bot
NeatQueue can do all of that
and better
hmmmmmmmmmm
thanks pro ‚ù§Ô∏è
<@145305657237700608> Can I make my bot where it chooses teams by roles?
Automatically
And make it keep track of for example Goals and Assists?
I‚Äôm trying to help a Hockey League where you queue and it makes you go on a team depending on what role you have (Team Name) and at the end of the game you enter the amount of Goals And/Or Assists you get then that goes in a leaderboard
<@145305657237700608>
<@1039536805357289545>
But multiple teams usually play at the same time so idk how it will work
No, it didn't work, I tried to reisntall the queue into another channel to try again. I set everything by default to be sure, then I did /ratinginname format '- ($)' suffix and then the /ratinginname toggle 'enable' but it didn't work
there is no option for that
yes /roles or /balanceby
I have a Valorant server and trying to set this bot up for 10 mans. We have set rank roles in the server so could I use balance by and add the roles radiant through to iron and then it would balance by rank?
Sure, that would be if you don't want to use NeatQueue's MMR system, yes
Awesome, and how do the leaderboards work?
leaderboards always use the internal system, so everyone would start at whatever startingmmr you have set
Does anyone know how to add a "flex" role for League of Legends? When I add it, it automatically changes the team size to 6, I know it works because a different server I'm in does it perfectly fine for a different game
IE, can I have more roles than teamsize allows?
Also. When the players join the voice channels and they get the options of team captains/balancing etc what happens if more than one person clicks an option?
im not aware of any way to do that, its definitely not an intentional thing
its a majority vote
Perfect thank you
What would happen if a player had more than one of those roles? Would it rank them on the highest? Sorry for all the questions
yes they get the highest one
Why do I just get spammed with this when trying to use the / test feature?
did you join the voice channel?
Yeah
It seems it only gives me about 1 second to do it, need to be faster
testing mode gives about 10 seconds
How long does it give players normally to join?
5 minutes, `/lobbychannel timer`
I am using this in a Valorant server. Anyway to configure the maps so it picks one to play or not?
if you want to ban map by map, just add maps with /map add and set /map bans
having an issue where the queue doesnt empty when the game starts
and ppl arent removed from it when the game ends
<@145305657237700608> can I make it where captains get randomly selected and then players get filled into both teams instantly without having to choose them?
So Its like a matchmaking thing and you cant choose who you wanna be with, so its all random except for the map picks
the captains would be useless in that case, no?
It would be good to vote for maps
all in all, captain selection is always 1 by 1
Captains will vote on maps
Random players into there teams
nah, currently cant do that
So players must be selected right?
Or can I make it with no captains and just random teams.
yea if its just random teams, it will instantly be picked
How do I do that
Where its just random players no captains and maps can be voyed.
Voted by the players
`/teamselection` and select Random
probably want to disable `/reshuffle` as well
Hi, can somebody help me to move some credits from one server to another?
sorry somehow missed your DM, yea i can do that
wee neeed this ‚ù§Ô∏è
How to fix this?
Also, if you chose to do rematch will it keeps the team the same or is there an option to remake teams with the same players?
its the same teams
im assuming you have no points
Is there any way to set what voice channel it kicks everyone in to once the game has ended?
`/lobbychannel set`
Hey <@145305657237700608> 
Is it possible to check how many queue bans are active rn? If no, could it be added?
`/player banlist`
Thanks!
<@145305657237700608> The bot is replying late? is there some issue?
looks fine, what command?
Is there a way to check my balance roles?
I have used all 20, but I got one wrong so I changed that one and I want to double check them all now
Or even a way to check all my settings?
yup /info
balanceby roles is around page 7
Thanks
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to make a config the default where anyone can do like /start <game mode name> and it would start it
It worked fine afterwards, sorry for the late reply
Is there a way to make it so if a player misses a queue, they get banned from queuing for like 2 hours or something?
Hey, is there any way to figure out why some players start with negative mmr (-100) in their rank sometimes?
/player autoban
that would be strange, unless you have that as a starting mmr
i'm starting to think it's because I removed some players from their role for inactivity, and when they've been given the role again they might start with -100
unless you explicitly remove their stats, they wouldnt get reset or anything
when i type /setup nothing happens
it just says this and then does nothing
make sure the bot has perms for the channel
Is there a way to make my config code the default setup for my server so thaw when I do startque it just using that rule set?
no, but you can load any code with /load, you dont need to use /startqueue before
Thanks
hey, is there a command for reversing a result?
/outcome
Neatz how many upvotes we need on the last Suggestion to get accepted
is there any way to have a message that shows how many Q's are going on at a time?
how can l close vote system
only staff can vote
it‚Äôs already accepted i just don‚Äôt have time to work on it
i‚Äôm planning on adding a whole permissions command which lets you specify the perms/roles for each command
Perfect
How come my queue isn‚Äôt staying at the bottom anymore
not currently no
you can't fully disable it, but its a majority vote, so it should be the correct voted result
staff can always the force the vote
it was working fine last night and i get on today and the queues are being pushed up unable to be seen now
is the bot down or something?
its not down, sometimes this does happen to some channels though, can you try /clearqueue?
didnt fix
its like that for every one of our queue channels
anything else i can try? i wanna try to figure this out so ppl can play again
Hello, i cant seem to use the /register command on a Discord Server.
ill restart the bot, that has fixed it in the past
ty appreciate it
lmk whenever u do and ill see if it fixed
The bot is really struggling right now, not deleting channels, not moving people, making some setup kinda hard. Is it just lag?
bot restarted, probably just that
fixed?
thank you for the help
how can l set up only staff
you cannot
whats this error?
did it break the queue?
yeah, veto stopped
and i cant use /outcome selectwinner
Hey, how can I change the commands that a certain role is able to use, if I want someone to be able to only cancel games, revert votes, and ban people for example
what is 8 Mans?
l need only Mmr system
Can I transfer member MMR data for a queue to a different server? My main server is getting really popular for custom games, and I'm wanting to make a dedicated server just for custom games, but I don't want to lose the data for my members.
how can l close voice channel requirement
Hello <@145305657237700608> 
I have a question about leadeboards. 
If I post 2 leaderboards from 1 queue in different channels, they will share /ignoreroles?
i can transfer the data when you need
/voicechannels
if they both refer to the same queue, it will use the same config
now working
Is it possible to run 2 different queues with different settings and leaderboards?
yup, settings are always separate
for stats, just obey this
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
Great thanks
Id like to run 3 different channels on the same elo system. Would this be possible?
-What I want to do is divide my player base into 3 different skill groups (3 different channels) on the same elo system.
-Ping when you respond so I can see it please.
"All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!"

I think this might answer my question
yup this is very common
just name all the queues like it says, then all the stats will be shared between the queues
I have a question, how long does it hold data? Is it based off a number of games or a timeframe? And can stats be manually put in?
what data?
Like stats and all that.
stats are never deleted unless you do it yourself
I don't get it. I want to do basic rating for my server, however I think I am doing something wrong. We played two matches, today I wanted to check my stats and everything is default.
what server?
Are you asking me specifically about the server? Should I give you its id or something?
when i do / stats theirs a part that says points. what are those for?
sure or the name
points are a separate system, which you gain for playing and can use in predictions
How can does the api work? I saw that there is a generate api token in the docs but nothihg happens when its clicked
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=webhooks-generatetoken
Alr, and for example I want to send a request to the api to set a winner, what do I write at the team, numbers or team name
anyway to have it so this bot moves people automatically to a vc? if not anyone know of a bot that can do this?
if you mean to the lobby channel, you can use /lobbychannel pullall
if you aren‚Äôt creating some external integration, you shouldn‚Äôt use the API
oh ok, yeah cause i know some people that i do this with, want to be pulled into the server
just use the commands instead
ok thanks
Yea I want the server's bot to be able to do it so that I will be able to create moderation roles without giving all the permissions
ah gotcha
it is the team number
Is it 1 and 0 or 1 and 2?
but also, you should be able to rely on people the select the correct winner since it‚Äôs a majority vote
it‚Äôs 1 indexed, so 1,2, etc
Yea but you know, there can be some trollers
hmm but it‚Äôs a majority vote
The server I am running it on has a large community of trollers
the winners won‚Äôt troll to say they lost
Idk but like I want it as an option
fair
Will there be an option to ban someone using the api?
sure i can add that
I would love it as an option
Could make moderation viable without giving people the option to end queue or reset all stats
i‚Äôm planning on allowing per-command permissions customization, just haven‚Äôt had the time
Yea api could be a temp replacement
is there a way to disable the voting flag in the anticheat
530765150530043914
I'm not sure, maybe the stats reset when the queue ends? I guess that would mean that if I want to have them forever then the queue should be continuous?
no, they dont get reset ever
i see you changed queue names a bunch, stats are tied to the queue name
What if I used startfromvc to create a queue? Is there a chance to recover this data?
ah, startfromvc creates a new queue named "Game" if there isnt an already existing queue
if you do /queuetype Game, the stats will show up
or do /migratestats old_name: Game new_name: WhateverYourNameIs
oh okay, this solves my problem, thanks
Without having people vote on how teams are seperated could we have it balanced by default? In normal PUG queues
is there a way to see how many games have been played in a set period?
nvm figured out i could just use match history and ctrl+f
yup just use /teamselection
hello
just what do i need to do to join a specific role
could you elaborate more?
what do i have to do to get only a specific role to join
oh, use /rolerequirement
and  whats map selection
/map add
is there a way to make someone without admin rights be able to manage the bot?
you  can add a /staffrole
bump
apparently not, that is strange
not sure how i missed it
Is there a way to auto lock the queue when a game is in progress?
We are running 10 man customs and a lot of the time the same 10 people will want to play again but not rematch (we change teams up) but other people will get in the queue while a game is in progress so when that game finishes some people can't queue up again
how can I disable mmr for a queue?
its there a way to remove queues?
it will be /endqueue
does it remove it? because i did alot of test queues and i want to remove them
yes you will be able to create a new queue in the same channel after
but you will need to delete the messages
which messages?
of the queue
the main queue message
for join and leave
Are you talking about the matches, or the main queue itself?
the matches
wait
just a sec
Queues
Valoran: 1 Players - 0 Matches //
Valorant: 1 Players - 1 Matches //
valo: 1 Players - 1 Matches //
valorant: 2 Players - 0 Matches //
vALORANT 10MANS: 1 Players - 0 Matches //
try: 4 Players - 1 Matches //
adwdaw: 1 Players - 0 Matches //
Valomatch2: 11 Players - 1 Matches
vmatch1: 11 Players - 1 Matches
those with // are the ones i plan to delete
they are showing cuz there is at least 1 player with stats in those queue names
you can do `/resetstats all queue_name: ...`
or just leave them, it doesnt hurt
thank youuu very muchh, how do i rename a queue??
/queuename
Hey, I wanted to know if I can disable register with game to give mmr higher than starting mmr set in the queue, and how the anti cheat works?
you can disable register with /requireregister if thats what you mean?
and the anticheat just flags the specified conditions
where can I see the conditions?
`/anticheat`
Can you auto ping only 1 role when a queue is made? Or is 2 possible?
How can I change the amount of time before players are allowed to vote for the winner?
currently its just 1 role
yes `/timer winnervotemessage`
Is it possible to add that as a feature? Autoping multiple roles when a queue is made?
Also how do the credits work on the website? If you buy only 1 or 2, does that mean you get 1 or 2 more queues to use?
no credits let you purchase premium
If i manually remove someone from the queue before the timer runs out to join the lobby will it just put the other players back in to the queue to start again?
when a match is cancelled due to someone not joining, everyone is put at the front of the queue
If I give access to a admin command through the integrations page for a role, will it let people with the role run the command without problems or it requires permissions / staff role
it won't work, the Discord integrations are just for hiding/showing commands to different roles/permissions
since there is no way for the bot to hide commands for people without the staff role, it uses its own internal permissions system
Alright, will there be an option to ban from the queue via the api soon?
i can add that today
I would love that
Would be cool if you could implement a report system
if someone gets reported enough times they can be banned from queueing etc
Extra moderation tools, not sure if thats possible
the leaderbaord on a diferent channel
keeps saying queue not found
if you have more than 1 queue, you will need to /link
Would it be possible to add autopinging to multiple roles for the/autoping command?
is it possible to limit the amount of times a player can queue per day/month?
not currently, what is the reason you are thinking?
I wanted to create a second queue for better player, so they can play without getting jeopardized from bad players, but I wanted it to be limited so that they would still be mixed up from time to time
that's what we did in our discord. We used the autorole by mmr setting to give players roles like diamond gold etc and we have multiple queues, except you can't see the high elo queue unless you have like diamond+
btw is it possible for ranks to show on the leaderboard? or just mmr
also this bot is crazy im donating my life savings
you can lock and unlock queue in specific times
you cant show ranks, it might be cool to allow you to set images for each rank, and I could make those show on the leaderboard perhaps
we are using emojis for ranks in the server

<:Platinum:1095631445734719518> = platinum
<:Diamond:915721484876541992> = diamond
<:Master:915721504023515176> = master etc
i think at level 2 discord boost you can put an emoji next to ur name as part of the role as well
How would i go about setting up a simple queue system? Like i start the queue and players click join and it puts them in a 5v5 scenario on random teams?
`/setup`
and then use `/teamselection` to lock to Random teams
Is there a way for the tournament mode to balance by role like the normal queue? For example 4 teams of 5 which allows 20 random people to sign up and then the bot makes the 4 teams?
is there a way to make it so you can give priorty captains to people
you can config a tournament the same way you do a queue
you can use `/captains role`
people with the role will become captain
is there premium stuff i can pay for to get premium features
all features are free, premium just lets you unlock high caps on daily games, max players, and max queues
ah i thought there might be a way to configure starting elo between roles
for example role x starts with 50
and role y with 100
is there a way to do that or
yes thats with `/startingmmr`
Hi I'd like to know if the queues we create are unique & trackable to the people who played in them
As you play, you have your stats tracked for the given queue name. Does that answer?
I'm unable to find the past queue names
Is there a command or something for it?
I need the unique queue names that is associated to the player to record it separately
you can use `/serverstats info` to see all the queue names + associate player counts
Okay thanks
how can you force cancel someone elses game
as staff you can use `/outcome cancel`
the queue isnt staying at the bottom again. i tried clearqueue and it didnt fix it
how do you make it so mmr is automatically on as default
The Enable vs Disable thing?
automatically its enabled
how u do that
`/mmr change allow_disable allow_disable:False `
is the premium one time purchase?
or monthly subscription?
its monthly
Can u remind me of the command to see all my settings again pls?
Also wondering how the balance by role actually works? We are getting some very weird matches using it
Our Valorant games are sometimes really unbalanced. Just had:

radiant
immo 3
immo 3
dia 3
plat 1

vs

immo 1
immo 1
ascendant 3
ascendant 2
ascendant 1
with balance by role?
Yeah
those actually dont look unbalanced
let me check
they are perfectly balanced
if you assign a number for each rank
Plat 1 = 1
Plat 2 = 2
...
Radiant = 13

and add the values for each team, they both equal 44
thats really the best we can achieve
Ok I‚Äôll let my guys know Ty
np, its just cuz of the Plat 1 on Team 1
it really brings down their average rating
Yeah, I wonder if there is a way to put a bigger variable between the top ranks
Like immortal 3 is soooooooooo much better than immortal 1 and 2‚Ä¶like more than a points worth if that makes sense
yea for sure
i would probably need to change it so that you can specify a "rating" for each role
say Plat 1 is 3, Immo 3 is 20, radiant is 30, or something
doing it automatically probably wont work cuz it wont work if every situation
Yeah we have a code we use for in house stuff before this bot. We could assign a set number to each rank
the only other temporary approach would be to changing the /startingmmr for each of the roles
That‚Äôs what we do but can change the rating for each
Would I then need to balance based on MMR instead of the actual role then?
Do you think it would work if I split the top ranks with some fake/blank roles? Like this:
I didnt read context but just increase/decrease the mmr gap between ranks
I am balancing by role not by MMR
I don't like the idea of using the bot MMR tbh. We have plat players higher in our leaderboard with more MMR than Immortal players just because they get matched with Radiants every game and carried to easy wins
Hey I had an issue yesterday night, we did a queue and at the end we voted for the winning team (logic) but the bot attributed the points at the other team... any idea on that? Or something to fix it manually?
Can you override the result with this?
Let's go it worked thanks üôÇ
I have someone that did at least a queue yesterday but it doesn't show in his stats, like he has 0 games and his MMR is still at 1000 (default) any idea?
Can you check the results
Like this
Yes actually I have 2 players that have this problem (they lost points because of the lose which is normal) but they still have the default MMR which is 1000
And no game played in the stats
This is the queue
William and Voeti did a stat check after and it appears like this
Any ideas to fix this? Or to give the points manually?
that would be a solution actually
you can always modify stats with /set and /add
Awesome, ty
btw guys if everyone wants to give permission for specific commands of the bot, what you need to do is to give the role staff permissions, and then in the integrations page turn off the commands for the role globaly, and then turn on only the commands that you want the role to access
i never thought about that
but yea that would fully work
we tried it and it works
but it is not that command specific, for example the /player command gives access to every command that starts with /player
<@145305657237700608> I changed a setting for captains to be selected by balance and it gave captain to the highest rank and lowest rank? Is that right?
maybe it doesnt balance by roles in that
ill have to check
if not, thats a bug
Ok thanks, seemed a bit weird
you should pin my message lol
ill try and write a step by step thing in a little
yea why not
since you can have any number of staff roles, it should let you create any number of roles with special perms
but you should still make it so we can choose role specific commands, because if for example I want my staff to be able to ban, but not unban it is not possible
true
its a temp solution
it works well also if you don't want players to access specific player commands
ideally I would hide all staff commands by default, but that is not supported through the Discord API currently
What we did is we turned off all commands for the admin role, and then turned on the commandss we wanted them to have
yea makes sense, it just needs to be manually done
is the map randomizer bugged or sum
it's gave the same map alot of times
same with random teams
yea it's giving the random teams too
all the random features I think are jugged
bugged
is there a way to fix this
maybe it was because we played 2v2, but 7 times in a row gave the same teams
or I'm just lucky idk
nah bro the guys told me the teams are same teams
and the map has been bind for 6 times in a row
when I removed it as a map then it was breeze in a row
I have the same thing with the maps
did y end up fixing it?
Always chooses the same 2. Yesterday had same map 5 times in a row
what I thought is maybe double qdd the maps it doesn't choose
Nah I just put bans in so people could ban the last played so never get same one twice
Yeah increasing the odds of non picked maps each time would be great
or like a true randomizer
My players are starting to just vote for the map they want at this point
yeah the problem with that is ppl play same maps over and over if they vote and I kinda want it to be competitive and random
Yeah understandable
anyway, what is a global queue? is it something like you can play with other servers or what? if not is there an option to gather your party and play with some random people from other servers that use this bot?
everything random is true random, which doesn‚Äôt feel very random
getting the same map 7 times a row is just how randomness works sometimes
globalqueue lets your queue share a leaderboard with other servers
oh okay
perhaps there should be a map selection mode which uses the "least frequent" map each time
That could work
how can l change this
Hello i am having an issue with members trying to start que but cannot the role has the use the commands permision but is giving me this message
startqueue is a staff command
wdym?
l want it 3v3
not 4v4
change the /teamsize
oh okay so only staff can access the setup que stuff
correct
/forcestart
can you say me how l will reset the match
one player not coming to match
you can /cancel in progress matches
is this a feature yet
no lmao
bro it has done bind for like 10 games now
u got like a fix
what server?
my server
vanguard customs
you can send the config with /save and ill test it, but im sure its just unlucky
MCNHO
its not random maps?
no but when they select
random on the map pool
i changed it to this becus it wasnt random on the random
i just tried and got 3 different maps
must be just unlucky
btw if u add like good premium features imma buy all of it
cus this bot is crazy good
nah, i dont do premium features, everything is free
how you making money
premium is just for max limit increases
more players + more games per day, etc
i dont make much LOL
non profit bot
respect
anyways i will add the least-frequent map choice
no i make profit
but not much
nothing insane but its good
not quitting my job anytime soon üòÑ
ahhh maybe one day
hey, did you change anything with the leaderboards on the site? They don't appear properly to me
what link?
https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/1043184884212043848/1083057695315198012
https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/1043184884212043848/1090225942762373150
but it's basically any leaderboard, it just stops scrolling at 11th position
Is it possible to start a queue from voice chat and start it with random teams without any confirmation, etc.? Clicking through Join Queue, going to the voice channel of the queue, voting how the teams should be drawn, then confirming if the teams are correct over and over again is just tedious
I know there is a `startfromvc` command, but it doesn't work the way I want it to and its stats don't assign to the name of my queue
oh, you are right
i accidentally set a max height to the leaderboard page when I added the footer, whoops
fixing
^ fixed
all of that is customizable
whatever you dont want, you can change
ty ^^
but is it possible to change the startfromvc command? i mean that it takes data from a queue named Game and not from queue Example, is it possible to set this somehow? if so with what command?
hmm i can make it take an optional arg for the queue name
can l add automatic ranked roles
like when someone has 1500 mmr he/she is getting abc role
yes with /autoroles
okey thx
Where is the integrations page?
is it possible that a match name will be with an emoji?
for example ‚öîÔ∏è match#12345
would be great, how long will it take to add such functionality?
server settings
maybe today
not currently
how do i send the winner message to a separate channel
`/resultschannel`
Hiya, was wondering if there was a way to rollback the mmr gain/loss from a game? I don't wanna bother the people in charge of the server if it's not possible but people voted for a game before it even started because they wanted to cancel the queue and now, without playing a game, we're lost/gained points respectively <:sadcatto:611977737288286214>
you should be able to use /outcome cancel
Thank you ^^
Just a heads up, the webhook.site link here -> https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=webhooks-1 doesn't work. Seems like they delete them after a while
ah thanks, that‚Äôs annoying lol
and how is it going?
is there a way where i can do 2 ign such if i create one for valorant and other for overwatch ?
forgot, ill do it today
yea, if they are different queues, its different IGNs
if there is a queue in the channel you use the command, it will use that queue
so it will use the same name
oh okay, any way to skip queue setup? if I already have the mode defined by the current queue I don't think I need to set it up again?
i mean this
hmm thats true
ill fix it so if the queue exists, it skips all setup
that should fix it all
does it auto drag once queue fills or is there a command for that ?
yes with `/lobbychannel pullall`
will it be done today?
perhaps
is there a section for modes such as in overwatch they have different modes for different maps
when you add a map, you can specify the gamemode
Howdy - I am having trouble setting it up. It seems like after I do the /setup command nothing happens
the bot is probably missing perms to send messages in that channel then
it would send an error, but it cant lol
possible to make the voice channels/channels in a different category then the queue?
yea /channel category
also possible to change the queue names when they are made from like queue73838 to something more simple
same w teams
like ct or t for example in teams
you can do /teamnames
but currently can‚Äôt change the queue name
alright thanks
so i can't section them so captain can't choose gamemodes then map ?
nvm i think i found it
I'd be happy with a list of curl requests, or even an Insomnia collection (this would be the best)
i‚Äôll get something updated soon, best thing for now is just test it yourself
ah ok sorry, is there a way where you choose the gamemode first then map ?
yup that‚Äôs how it works by default
it's the other way around lol so you chose maps then gamemode
that‚Äôs map bans, not picking maps
oh yeah but is there a way where i can have it so they choose the gamemodes first ?
not with map bans enabled at least, that‚Äôs just the order
you would have to rig it up using /votingmenu
ah ok let me see if that works
when its selected channel in new category
does the category go below the current category or down to the bottom/top
wanna make it easier to navigate
what does it mean by parent category
like the one above?
parent is the default, same category
honestly for the new category location i don‚Äôt remember, can‚Äôt verify right now, i believe it‚Äôs the bottom
how to remove this ?
it‚Äôs /reshuffle
is it possible to send players to the queue vc automatically when it starts? if so, what is the command for it?
is there anyway to remove the auto mute feature from the spectator role?
/lobbychannel pullall
when you add the role, there is an optional arg called can_speak
umm for some reason its not working? not sure if its bugged or if im doing it wrong. im doing can_speak true and people are still coming into the call muted
nvm it should be fixed sorry for the trouble
how is the work going?
Hi üôÇ so interesting problem I'm running into. When parsing the Webhook response, the Discord IDs are represented as integers. However they exceed the maximum value for ints and end up breaking things in JavaScript.

Can you return it as a string value rather than an integer?
If I really need to I can use a library like https://github.com/sidorares/json-bigint, but ideally it'd be transmitted as a string
nvm I just used that library, although something to consider for the future
i should convert to strings, i do the same thing when using the API
dope, only thing to consider is other potential users of the webhook
Is there a way to get the bot to DM people when the queue is full? I get people with notifications off missing the pings sometimes
ty! and another question is there a possible way to reset stats completely for /serverstat info? (like games played)
not via a command, the games played thing is never deleted
ahh icic because i did a lot of testing so the games counted arent real games but thank you!
i haven't stopped waiting brother
yea havent had the chance, but its low priority since its not really a bug + not breaking anything
can i skip it?
<@145305657237700608> sry for ping, but i need to fix it quickly
/teamselection
thanks
Looking at the tournament options it only seems to let you sign up with a party? Is there a way to set it up so individual players can join and then the bot makes the teams?
no, it does not support forming random teams currently
ok no worries
Is there a way to pick what captain gets first pick? Or will it just be random
my leaderboard link doesn't work but /leaderboard for the queue name works
any idea why?
https://www.neatqueue.com/lb/RCTier1
server id: 1021498784670298152
hmm that is strange
hey, just tried Hero bans. Wanna know, is it possible for the Voice channels to be created and the teams moved into their own voice channels before the hero ban voting phase starts? Right now from what I saw, the agent  bans also happen when everyones in the common voice channel
Yup you can use `/voicechannels moveteam when:After Teams Created `
If I turn off decay for MMR will it wipe the current mmr players have and start fresh?
nope, it just will stop decaying
and if i change the default mmr gained it also wont wipe it
nope it wont
question how do yu add map bans and map picks for the games
does it just come with the bot
or is there a command
`/map add`
and `/map bans`
okay thank yu
before I go asking for help for super simple issues, is there a setup page that I should refer to first? thx
not really besides https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=quick-start
I have set up the custom roles that get assigned to top players. I wanted to assign roles to the top 3 in the leaderboard and when I set it up it all worked, however, this morning someone else moved in to 3rd place. The role was removed from the previous 3rd place but the new 3rd place wasn't given the role. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?
how do i remove this from popping up
pls and thankyou üôÇ
and what perms does the bot need üôÇ
maybe cant assign roles to that user? otherwise not sure
can try /autoroles refresh to give the bot another try
/voteforresult False if you dont want the match to have a winner
everything it asks for when you invite it needs at some point
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to lock the queue while a game is in progress?
not automatically, but you can manually lock with /lock
ah I was hoping for an automatic option, no worries. Thanks
Sorry one more question. If my queue fills up but then 1 person doesn't join the VC the other 9 players get returned to the queue, but what happens if 2+ people have already joined the queue while they were forming the first group? Would one of the original 9 lose their spot?
the first 9 go straight to the front of the queue
so the first of the 2 new people would be their 10th
i dont really see the value in it since then you just have the same 10 people playing
Yeah I get that. We are having issues where a game needs to get cancelled because of 1 player but then because they aren't returned to the queue automatically there are always a few extras already queueing for the next one so inevitably some people from the original group lose their places
you can /clearqueue before that maybe
Ok that could work, it only happens very occasionally
is it possible to turn off party's
so that partys cant joint this queue
yup /partyqueue
Is there a way to see the draft select order? For captains draft
wdym the order
Like who got picked first, third etc
Also is there a way to make it where you can‚Äôt select the same person twice for captain? Each person has 2 votes and they can pick the same person twice
i should probably fix it so you cant select the same option twice
<@145305657237700608> sorry for the ping. I am using the command '/startingmmr set' and trying to assign a set amount of MMR to some different roles however everyone is still on 1000.
Even if I try and remove MMR it stays at 1000
probably need to reset stats, if they already have an MMR it won‚Äôt change
Ok think I got it, the reset worked
Does '/resetstats all' reset the leaderboard?
If they already have MMR do I have to close old queue and set up a new one then?
you need to reset the stats of whoever you want
Hello!
Maybe this has come up and I didn't search correctly or click around enough. But what is the deal with the ID instead of the name and how would I find/know who this person is?
it‚Äôs a discord issue, means your client hasn‚Äôt seen any data about that user in the session
Interesting. Is it missing something in the ID?  Even when copy/paste the <@ID> it says Unknown User
are they still in the server?
hmm well if they werent, they would have been removed
They are and set with a role. Others some can see the name, some can not.
yea if some people see it and some dont, thats just a discord bug
Oof okay. Thanks!
restarting the client sometimes fixes it
Hi I need a bit of advice with the leaderboard
I have set it up to balance on MMR now and everyone is assigned a ranked role with a different starting MMR to keep it balanced. However in doing this it means the highest rank players are automatically at the top of the leaderboard because they start with so much MMR.  A radiant could have lost 2 games but be ahead of someone that is plat but won 2 games. I was wondering if it‚Äôs possible to view the leaderboard in a way that shows your wins v loss without the mmr? So someone that has won 2 and lost 1 would be above someone that has won 1 lost 1 no matter their mmr/rank
no, there isnt a way to do that since everything is based around MMR
Ah ok
Is there any way to remove vote timers or can you only increase the time?
can only increase it
ok ty
you can try /balanceby roles
Yeah that's what we did for the last 2 weeks
and it kinda worked but
some people in my server have higher ranks then they probably should and so they were ranked quite high by the bot and one person lost 30 games and only won 7 over the course of 2 weeks
I thought the MMR would work better because the bot would technically keep de ranking them
but then it is making the leaderboard a bit redunant
MMR is the fairest when everyone starts at the same MMR
after a few games, matches get more fair
also, you can do captains, random, etc if you dont want to rely on Balacned
I think we might try using the in game auto balance and then player picks for teams so they can join whatever team the actual game puts them in
I think when everyone is at same rank/skill level definitely. We have Silver players and Semi pros in the same lobbies sometimes
Anyone know how to change it so it shows whos in queue instead of Anom. queue?
I'm using the Valo Config from <#1068605714098049054>
Thanks though, I will make a donation at the end of the month. Bot has been great and you have been really helpful
This I think
sure, but since the worse players will drop faster, the matches will get fairer
until that happens, dont use Balanced, use Random or Captains
Trynna use mmrdecay. Lets say I want decay to start for 3 days of inactivity. 

So basically I need to use the command and set 259200 as the seconds for the duration (72 hours)? Trying to make sure üòÑ
yup exactly
Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
Also, lets say in 3 days they havent queued and it drops the MMR by the value (10MMR). How frequently does it drop the MMR? does it only reduce by 10 every 3 days or ?
yea it will do it every 3 days
And in balancing, lets say I select the teamselection by default to Balanced. Whats the difference between balancing by Balanced, and assigning both Balanced AND Random?
itll just show a voting menu between the options you have enabled
so people can pick either Random or Balanced
hola alguien que me pueda ayudar a poner el neat queue en mi server?
puedes usar /setup y hacer preguntas si tienes
si lo hice
sale solo la cola
y intento mas como para configurar para lol y nada
Hello I have been playing around with the bot - BTW great work.

any feedback on how to set up the following.

1v1 Q

Lights - Meds - Heavy - Ass  are the class base, but want only lights to play Lights ect ect
i would set up 3 different queues, one for each role
that way each queue has a specific class
Ok sweet i give that a go,  out if interest can you do that so all thh queues show up in the one channel ?
nah, it‚Äôs only 1 queue per channel
aww damn üò¶ 

Also follow up - what currency is the premium in
USD, but when you use stripe (the checkout platform) it should be able to convert i think?
thanks about 8 bucks AUD cheers for your help i play around with it
you can get 3 queues in the free tier üôÇ
Cheers always like to support the bots we use üôÇ
Is there a way to turn off team select for 1v1
/teamselection
Is there a way to get rid of are the team valid and just skip it ? or i am doing it wrong
And the only other thing i cant work out if I am doing it wrong or it cant be done 

can this be set up to like a map ban or teams have to pick which option they want to do  ( out of 4 choices, not just one team picks)
Is there a way to make it so that these channels are visible to a specific role?
Currently it is just people with admin privileges and the people in the match
I also wouldn't want to do anything like say give admin privileges to the bot
disable /reshuffle
change the team voting to all teams then
you can use the /spectatorrole to let people see it
Is this bot open source?
not currently
Is there a way to purge inactive users with the bot?
we have a lot of users that dont play taking up space on the player list so then it doesnt let new players in cause the limit was reached
only way would be to manually do it unfortunately
with `/resetstats player`
all good, thank u
actually
you could also give them all a specific role then do `/set games 0`
for that role
setting games to 0 will remove them from the max player count
and hide them on leaderboard
we need a party against party queue
that woud be fire
change queue type to Full Team vs Full Team
Hey I think i screwed it up 

Error code: DOMJV  

Any ideas or should i just blow it away and start again
looks like the voting menu option was too long
i thought i made it smart enough to cut off long options
just remove it and make sure it‚Äôs less than 100 characters i think
thanks mate
i am great at breaking thing üòõ
the pain of customization = discovering new discord limits
Thanks that worked.

Hopefully i am not bugging you TOO much, this bot is amazing üôÇ

last two question from now 

rematch, is there a setting that both players have to agree ?

and can you do two map bans or is there a mode ban ( that works like a map ban) - have 4 modes and would like to ban 3
So I'm trying to do a staffchannelset and it tells me the neatqueue doesnt have manage channels permissions, Ive double checked and know that it does. Any ideas?
rematches require all players to agree
you can do any number of map bans
it must be missing the perm somewhere, is it just that command?
How do you set up the second map pool
wdym
not just that command but ive check it has the perm for both the channel and the full server
I just went to the designated channel, and gave it all perms and it worked but it did already have the "manage channel" permission. Maybe the error needs to list one of the other permissions but im unsure
Is there a map ban option for something like a mode ban.. eg you ban a mode till you get down to 1 left?
ah, no there is no mode banning
Is it possible to transfer queue stats/leaderboard from one server to another?
i can manually do it, but you cant via any commands
If that's possible can I dm you the server info
for sure
do u have the option to take back action/ keep data? i accidentally restart the queue so now the stats are gone
Thanks does any of the voting menus have the ability to work like the map ban, if not would be a cool feature:)
Hey is anyone able to help me please
I've just added the bot to my server, and i've got a couple of questions.
Setting it up for League of Legends
Just curious if there's a way to have the queue set up in a channel '#inhouse-signup' but have the updated information of that queue be displayed in a private staff channel? As in, We would see the same interface where it shows players that have joined the queue. Also i'm curious if there's a way to have the temporary text and voice channels that open when the queue is full, to be renamed to something you choose?
Another thing as well, i've set my staff channel to have queue updates be displayed in, but nothing is being sent to the staff channel, in terms of updates with what's happening to the queue, and if the match has enough players to start etc, is there a way to have that set up?
i've just gotten an error code as well, XKYAR
missing perms in the predictions channel
stats are never deleted, but they are stored under the queue name. just rename your queue back to the old name
yes custom votingmenus can function the same
sorry, cannot do either of those things
it's given me another error as well,  FORJL
no worries
same error
okay, every time I now try to start a match, it's just giving me different error codes
the "error codes" are just unique each time so i can see the exact config at the time
oh okay
I'm a little confused what's happening then, i've enabled predictions and set the predictions channel?
yea it cant send the message in the channel
oh I understand now, sorry. I needed to specifically give it permissions in the predictions channel I created
thanks, sorted it now
Okay and as long as i've set the staff channel, that's the only channel that it'll send the prompt to decide the winner of the match yes?
Or will that prompt of deciding who is the winner of the match be displayed in the same channel where players queue up?
itll show in both channels
Is there a way to hide that from the queue up channel? because I want it to be only staff members that can decide winners
no, but i meant to add that as an option to /voteforresult
ah damn, yeah that'd be helpful to have
Is there a way to see everyone's MMR including people that aren't currently on the leaderboard?
ill update in a bit to add it
not really, unless you used the API
actually nvm it wouldnt show there
Ok no worries
<@145305657237700608> hey, I've put map selection to random and it still goes for veto, why so
disable map bans
How do I? I tried
`/map bans 0`
Hi thanks for adding the requested map randomizer. We‚Äôve been trying it out on the setting that picks least frequent maps and modes. there‚Äôs been a noticeable amount of times when the maps have repeated. Modes have been fine though. Is there a way to fix?
Here‚Äôs an example
hmmm
it‚Äôs cuz they are seen as separate maps currently
i should be able to fix it though
Is there anymore infomation you could give me on how to set that up, ATM with 4 choices Team 1 getting a choice and team 2 is getting another choice unsure how to end on one only
wdym end on one only
so with the vote menu if we have 4 choices and want to get it down to 1 only - can that be done
If it can, how i must be stupid haha
so Team 1, Team 2, Team 1?
yeah  

When i did vote per team it ended up with two choices
it did not stop when one left
what should happen at one left, that option is selected?
or its ignored
yeah ok i test it again and check, maybe its me haha
huh?
yeah that what i would like to happen
is it this
```` /votingmenu add title:MWO Mech choice options:Lights,Medium,Heavy,Assault key:Mech Ban team_voting:Per Team````
or all teams ?
depends on who you want voting
also, set an options_variable, that way the next Mech Ban will reuse the existing options
So with the above we get this
Trying to get an outcome like the map ban - have one choice
just re-add the votingmenu one more time
but set it to Team 1
aww got ya
ok sweet
thanks so much
with this what would you set ?
doesnt matter, its hidden
just make it mechbans
it will start with the original list of options, and will keep updating
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/910981294937210930/1088321291385311232
Thank you i got it working üôÇ
I noticed you can save the "config" does that mean i can upload it to another server ?
yup they are globally shared
Sweet this bot is amazing, i wish you well üôÇ
thanks! i see nothing showed up in <#970759363549605958> <:thonk:923562523217764464>
that is weird
Hey so i've used the /teamnames set command and named teams as Team 1 , Team 2 . Is that meant to rename the voice channels that the players get moved into once the match has enough of players in the queue voice channel?
because I notice that, the voice channel for my team is using my username, but the other voice channel is using Team 2
It's just me who is joining the voice channels since i'm still testing things, so it's only me in the voice channel I join (Team 1) and no one in Team 2 voice channel
I think I already asked about this, but i'm just confused on what the /teamnames set command is actually setting names for
it should change the team name everywhere
Yeah for some reason it's using my username
if the team only has one person, the team name will be the username
Oh okay, i'll test this with a second person in voice channel with me
`Team 1
@X (974.3) -> -33.5 -> 940.8
@Y (1000.0) -> -41.5 -> 958.5
@Z (1079.2) -> -39.1 -> 1040.1
@V (1154.6) -> -37.6 -> 1117.0
@W (1077.3) -> -39.1 -> 1038.2
Team 2
@ A (893.8) -> +36.6 -> 930.4
@ B (1115.8) -> +40.8 -> 1156.6
@ C (948.3) -> +40.7 -> 989.0
@ D (925.1) -> +39.5 -> 964.6
@ E(1035.6) -> +40.1 -> 1075.7`


Could someone explain this to me? Why is it that the ones with higher MMR already, get a little more MMR when winning and when they lose they also lose less than the ones with a low starting MMR? Am I missing something in the logic of how MMR is calculated?
likely due to placements + streak multipliers
hi neatz please help
the queue disappears before players can vote for winner team, how can i fix this
did you disable vote for results?
the 2nd one: winner for queue it went away when we finish the game
<@145305657237700608> is restricting who has the ability to decide the winner of matches something you're considering implementing?
I think I spoke about this earlier, would be very useful
yes that message is delete
yea didn‚Äôt get the chance to finish
Oh I see, no worries. i'm excited to see that eventually!
<@145305657237700608> Anyway i can stop people from queueing while their match is ongoing?
I don't get it, these multipliers I can set myself? and how to set placements if the player has already played matches?
yes you can toggle them on/off
wdym how to set placements if they already played?
<@145305657237700608>
you need to manually /lock
but people cant queue until they've voted for the winner by default
They can't?
How do i check if thats still in place? Bcoz some users dm'ed me saying people in match and still queueing
looks like its missing from the /info
but the command is /requeue condition
Ahh Thanks Man
Gotchu ‚ù§Ô∏è
but we never changet someting, last time u restartet the bot
i have 2 different game modes, solo and trios and i want both to have separate mmr. Is that possible?
yep, restarting now
is there restrictions for free version of neat bot
where can we see premium features
no, the queue will all be the same MMR per player
free tier is 50 games a day, 3 different queues, 500 players total
all features are free
where can i find premium info, pricing etc...
nevermind found it
it's monthly payment correct?
unfortunately i dont have access to credit cards, can i pay you 1 year premium with crypto instead? or other payments like OMT? (im still exploring the bot and havent decided yet)
yea people often can‚Äôt pay with cards, just DM me and i can help you out
great i will mess around with bot meanwhile
what I mean is that in my queue there are already people with matches played, however, I would like to reset the overall mmr, but leave the number of matches. In that case, the players after the mmr reset should play 10 placement matches, but it may conflict with the fact that they already have the number of matches above 10
right, if you dont delete the games played, they wont get a placement multiplier
ok, so I should just reset all the stats for queue?
that would work
why would you not want to reset everything?
also, the placement multiplier is small, so its not a huge deal
just to save the number of matches, as a souvenir
nothing important
can it be changed somehow or is it impossible?
not currently
and is it possible that players at placements will not lose mmr if they lose?  League of Legends thing
by the way, it is possible to simply change the name of the queue and thus reset the statistics?
yup, changing queue name will seem like it reset the stats
people often do this for like "Season 1", "Season 2", etc
no its an up + down thing
cool, will the automatic ranks then apply to the current queue with the name changed?
yup config still stays the same
so when you change names, it will recalculate the roles for everyone
okay, and last question, is it possible not to create a new text channel for the match? i would like to just have everything on one text channel
yup just disable /tempchannels
brilliant, thank you
Question how do I setup that after every match instead of the bot just kicking everyone out it moves them all to a certain vc
`/lobbychannel set`
Is there a way to remove someone from the leaderboard if they no longer want to be on it?
Voted for the bot to use leaderboard in server, but it's still saying someone needs to vote
WRT _ Maps
/bestof
Description
Sets whether the queue is a best of 3, 5, 7, etc.



Can this be set up so it plays the same map 3/5/7 and each game counts as a win/lose for MMR changes so on a BO3 it could be 2 wins team 1 and 1 win team 2
id rather not, most games ive played dont do some partial MMR changes, its either you win or lose
Yeah was just a faster rematch with out all the bans again - all good
Hello. i would like to ask if bot can be use to csgo?
yes it can
how can i set up sir?
i need to purchase first?
nope just run /setup
I already run the set u
Then after that?
Is there a way to make it so when a queue pops, people with a certain role will be able to see the queue channel
and also maybe get pinged?
Hi anyone available?
if you follow the setup thats all you need
you can add a /spectatorrole
sure i am
will this give access to the queue text channel?
how do I integrate neatqueue with my own csgo server?
like when I select map the server change itself after the voting
there is no in-game integration
you would probably want a bot like popflash for that
I see, thanks!
do you know different one?
popflash i think
got that
<@145305657237700608> how to lock queue if 10 players joined the queue? and how to unlock automatically once match was finished?
its been asked a few times, but you can do that, why would you want it?
Hey, recently players in my queue are ranking up in the queue but something's happening with their role
https://i.imgur.com/E7CgL18.png
Like, this guy ranked up to rank C but the discord role has not been given to him
is it maybe because it gave him the rank C and then it removed all the rank roles from him?
so they didnt receive the RANK C role?
yeah apparently they didn't receive it
or it got removed together with rank D
no clue
try `/autoroles refresh`
if its still missing, maybe the bot cant manage that role?
it's not responding
but did it work?
makes sense it didnt respond, oops, will fix
The command did work
but it gave wrong roles to wrong people
also to banned people
and it f** up kind of everything üò•
it would only give roles who fit your conditions
banned players are not exempt
shouldn't they be exempt? I mean they're banned why are they getting their role
or at least when someone is banned should get its mmr to 0 i guess
hmm yea maybe it should skip them
but anyways, people shouldnt be getting the wrong roles
i just noticed it gave the wrong roles based on the ceiling mmr
I got the rank down on 2750 from rank A to rank B, but the rankup from rank B to rank A is at 2800
and people between 2750 and 2800 who were still rank A, they got given the role rank B aswell
so the refresh is giving the lower role to everyone who was still in the upper rank
gotcha, it needs to be fixed to prioritize the higher role
i can fix that real quick
ok, that issue should be fixed
enterprise premium plan is a permanent one-time charge, or a monthly subscription?
also another question, if a captain is picking people, can I make it so a captain can only pick 1 person at a time, they don't get to pick 2 people occasionally
premium plans are monthly
and yea you can change the
`/captains drafttype`
because our server was only limited we got only 1 server as of now.
Hello everyone and <@145305657237700608>. I would like to ask some questions.

1- I don't want to vote balanced, highest mmr, random. It should be balanced like closest MMRs
2- Voting for winner team should be off. Loser team captain should vote for winner teams and that's it. We can't wait for +6 players vote
3- What's the difference between MMR and Point for this bot?
1) `/teamselection`
2) Currently there is no captains only winner voting, its either whatever you have set for `/requiredvotes`, or changed with `/winnermessage results`
3) MMR is the built in elo system, points are a separate thing gained per game and can be used in predictions
Thanks. How can I disable `/requiredvotes` and if I disable voting how `/winnermessage results` work?
you cant disabled required votes, you can just change the value
if you disable winnermessage results, you wont be able to pick a winner
This shows up in the same channel where players queue up
Is there a way to have this specifically show in a different channel for #match-results ?
yea you probably accidentally set it, but you can change with /staffchannel
hm I thought I already did that, i'll check that tomorrow after inhouses
<@145305657237700608> just another thing, I saw something about the winner vote thing?
has something been added to restrict it now?
or something that I guess does what I was asking about yesterday
yea there was a small change 2 days ago <#910981294937210930>
I see, so which command is it to set it as only staff can select the winner?
./voteforresults false?
Unexpected error occured
Join the Support Server for more information!
Error code: YLXXD
can someone help me?
that command is gone, use the new one
looks like you made your lobbychannel timer some insanely huge number? just make it smaller
yeah that's what i'm asking, what account allows me to prevent players from voting?
or sorry
command, not account
<#910981294937210930>
is 10k good?
`/winnermessage results`
yea thats fine, even 100000000 is fine
how does it know who is staff though?
/staffrole
or if someone has Manage Channel perms
why cant the other members view the leaderboards?
<@145305657237700608>
wdym?
its working already thanks
Hello <@145305657237700608> 
Can you delete all auto-locks in this queue? 1062402509504778300
Is it possible to have two different queues running in different channels for 2 separate regions?
yea queues can be totally split per channel
if I have one region setup already how would I go about starting creation in a separate regions channel?
also this bot is crazy you are incredible
if you want the same config you can /save and /loaf
/load *
thanks this is sick
any way to have the leaderboards display in a separate channel?
yup you might need to use /link
is it possible to allow players to bet points on matches they play in?
<@145305657237700608> is there any way to restart a queue, with its setting, that has been stopped with /endqueue and the person who did it didnt note the code for the saved configuration.
Any way to fix this?
It is only the MMR options that struggles to load
when you /endqueue it should say the config code in the message it sends
if you copy the discord link to the URL is it broken?
refreshing will fix it also
Refresh button doesn't do anything
The link does work
the neatqueue.com link, or the discord link?
if you click on the leaderboard image, and right click + copy link
Ok using that link opens discord in browser and then it displayed correctly.
but still not showing in the server on the app
must be an issue with your discord then
if the image is loading fine on browser
<@145305657237700608> hey so ran another inhouse tonight, and it's still not sending match results to the correct channel
it's just sending the results into the channel where players use the bot to queue up
if  you already changed the `/staffchannel`, that means you must have given a non-serverwide staff channel for the queue
`/staffchannel set` has an optional argument to set the staff channel for the current queue, or for the entire server
but if you have one set for the current queue, it will ignore the entire server staff channel
I made the match-results channel /staffchannel and had it server wide
i must be doing something wrong
Yeah I know, if I'd have done it myself I would've noted the code. But the other admin who did it didn't note it
Does that mean I have to setup the whole thing again? Or is there a way to obtain the code otherwise
check your /info, on page 1 is says "Staff Results Channel", which is the queue specific version
okay
on the last page, there is a "Staff Results Channel" for the entire server
these can be different
did they delete the message?
looks like this
Yeah I think he was ashamed of himself for doing that because I spent so much time on the config of the queue
And he deleted the message and tried to start it back himself
which server?
Pick-up League Hockey. Wanna get an invite to it?
thanks, no just needed the id
ah it's still set to inhouse-queue, do i need to do /staffchannel remove ?
then set match-results as the new staffchannel?
well, if you do the remove command, it will work
cuz it will remove only for the queue
whats the channel id actually, will be easier
not sure why, but when i do, /staffchannel set -> match-results -> serverwide true
it doesn't show up in the /info
as the staff results channel
it should show on the last page
since its a server wide setting
a bit confusing ill admit
oh sorry haha
yep it's there, thank you for the help
is that not the same channel as your results channel?
so originally all match results would show in the inhouse-queue channel, which is obviously meant only for the players to queue up through
nothing would ever be posted in the match-results channel
I never actually checked the /info, but now that I see it there, showing match-results
I suspect it'll work the way I need it to now
maybe you switched it on accident, it will send the normal match results in that channel
unless thats what you want
Yeah I only want the match results to show in the match-results channel not the inhouse-queue channel
gotcha
1073429529751728190
ok i have 7 configs saved from your server, whats the queue name?
Customs TNE -
or CustomsTNE
Just wondering, but have u considered a permanent plan?
I would probably buy it, but a monthly subscription is dismissing me from doing more than 3 queues, just a thought from my end
perhaps, although its not exactly a monthly subscription since there are no reoccurring payments or anything, you can extend your premium for an entire year whenever
Yeah that‚Äôs true, is buying credits via the website a way to extend it to yearly?
Or is that some other system
everything is through credits on the website currently
credits let you extend your premium by 30 days
but you can do that as many times as you want
since it stacks
Customs TNE -
If you have multiple one with that name, could you give me all the codes? Him and I tried things for fixing it and I want to be sure to have the correct one
Pmtyd that's the one!
Thank you !!
np üòÑ
Works perfectly. üôè
what is the normal drafttype neatqueue is set at
snake?
hi, what's up, how can i manage to select each time size? i want to make a queue for a football game and the teams are of 6 players, 5 players and 2 goalkeepers (12), how can i do that?
i saw in another server that it is possible
you can use `/roles`
thank you, and how can i make players 10 and goalkeepers 2?
/roles roles: Goalkeeper, Player, Player, Player, Player, Player
thank you so much
is there a way to have a reaction that players can react to an announcement with, that'll give them a role?
you can use `/reactionroles`
works the same as any reactionroles bot
awesome
it's asking for a message id
how can i get the id of a message?
you'll need to enable developer mode iirc
oh okay
only server owner can do that yeah?
no anybody can
got it done, thanks
does the queue i set won't expire?
<@145305657237700608>
nope it will run forever
okay thanks
<@145305657237700608> how do I take away this part of the bot?
dm me
`/teamselection`
then what?
/teamselection press enter
and chose
hello, i just wanted to ask if a player queues for 3 queues at the same time and one of them pops, will it take them out of the other queues?
yes it will !
i wanted to know if there was a way i can vote more then once in a day. i made a mistake on the leaderboard and canceled it
oh i guess cuz it‚Äôs technically the new month now‚Ä¶
i can manually unlock it for you in an hour, probs easier to get someone else to vote real quick
ohhh that makes sense
should be good now
Is there a limit to how many players can show on the leaderboard?
the free limit is 500
is there a way to set a map pool?
`/map add`
Does the monthly leaderboard have a soft mmr reset instead of starting all over?
you can do either "Reset" (hard reset), or "Rolling" which does not reset at all
how do i send the winner message to a different channelsw
`/resultschannel`
<@145305657237700608>  when i started the bot from the start, however i cant find the command or area where i can add a lobby message again any hints ?
Lobby details
`/lobbydetails`
I'm calling the API `api/queue/player/add` and it lets me add the same person multiple times (unless that's just the case with an admin). 

Is it admin only? Or can I technically add anyone multiple times
hmm currently the API / staff command skip the validation for adding the player
Ah, any chance we can change that? Or add an option for it?
I can try to add some logic on my end, but it risks race conditions and ideally it's something on your end <:tarikDance:1003367658642743357>
yea it probably should do all the same checks
thank you üôè
ill update when i wake up üôÇ
thank you!
what are you cooking up with this o_o
We're building out a hub for players that brings the queue system to our website. Status, joining, leaving. Eventually voting and more.

For now we're just doing the queue, and hopefully notifications/etc once I figure out the websocket stuff
gotcha that sounds cool, voting stuff is currently impossible lol but we shall see
i had to do my first websocket stuff recently so lmk if you ur super confused lmao
yeah I'm sure I'll be begging for API endpoints at some point üòâ
will let you know! just gotta figure out what I'm going to use to host it
Might try out Cloudflare's PubSub service that is in beta
for traditional hosting just use oracle cloud
(if u dont wanna pay)
How does the party system work? So if people in a party join queue, will they be on the same team or is it just only joining the queue with multiple people?
Also is there a way to gain points for predictions other than predicting? If a person goes to zero, is there another way to get points?
they will all be on the same team
you gain points for playing a game, but this can be customized with /points
default is 100 per game
Is there a way to customize the size of party allowed in a queue? Like for a 4v4 queue, I want to allow max parties of 2 to join.
yea `/partyqueue` has an optional max_size argument
tyty
Quick question is there anyway to have cross sever queues?
queues themselves are strictly per channel, but you can share leaderboards via /globalqueues
Ok so globalqueue only shares the leaderboard?
hey i have couple of questions
1- is there a limit to nb of maps allowed to be created?

2- i see that players can create more than 1 party, what happens when 2 parties play against each other while they have a specific player in common ?
Hey may seem kinda random but I been looking for a elo bot with this feature and just can‚Äôt find,

Is there anyway to start a que that allows any number of people to que up and then randomly selects the designated amount.

Example:
30 people que up,
Bot randomly picks 8 to play in the match
99% it has this feature, i have been scrolling for 2 hours to check commands haha
Basically I want to stream, have people from my stream all join discord and que up, it randomly selects 7 of them, we play match, and all que up again.

Is there a feature like this that makes this possible? And could I have certain discord roles that have greater chance of getting qued up?
is there an option to disable Cleanup timer please?
Is it possible to queue unranked? (without losing or winning mmr?)
1) no limit to maps
2) whoever joined first since you can only be in the queue once. if someone in your party is already in queue, it won‚Äôt let the party join
the only way i could see this sorta being achieved is via matchmaking or force starting the queue
matchmaking will only start when it has enough players within the same rating range
there is nothing that will randomly select players to play the match with though
you can change the timer with /timer matchcleanup
you can either disable it completely by just setting the mmr change to 0, or vote for MMR Disabled in the main team selection voting menu
yea but it's capped at 100 days , can you please check your DM ?
there‚Äôs no reason for it to be more than 100 days
i see your dm
i‚Äôll have to see how large i can make it
why not option to disable ?
so the bot is also used for long term games like turn based games
it‚Äôs just nice to have data automatically purge from the database to save space
yes i understand, default would be not disabled, but can you please allow bot admin to disable it ? honestly thats the only issue for me with the bot which keeps me away from using its premium
we play turn based game which can last very long time, sometimes a year +
perhaps make it premium only ?
well anyway please consider my offer in DM, i really need this üò¶
its easier to just increase the timer vs adding logic to skip, so im increasing the cap to ~20,000 days
estimated time until this update please?
its live
this is also live btw
Heya! Glanced around at most channels and wasnt able to find a solution so do let me know if i asked around in the wrong spot

Essentially im trying to set up a config with the bot where i can have the following done:

```Player 1 (A) wants to start a game but needs someone to play with
A enters the queue and awaits another Player (B)

Once B selects the second team it automatically pings both of them to essentially say "Hey i've grabbed someone for you to play with"
```

So far ive set it up as seen below, but by disabling the winner vote they dont get pinged about team creation

Id rather not have to set up private channels for the same but my ideal scenario is to just have the channel with the actual queue be empty aside from the bot's initial queue message

(or have the results autocleared)

Is that something that can be done with this bot or did i cause confusion with what i intend to do
so its just a normal 1v1 queue?
I used "Select Team On Join:"
With 1 player on each team and 2 teams for this
since its a 1v1 i would change the /queuetype to just be PUGs
itll show a single Join Queue button, once the queue hits 2 people, it will create a match for them
Thanks then! Ill try it out
Is there any setting that i can change in order to have these deleted?
not currently at least since it shows the final teams + estimated mmr change
Eek, thanks for the heads up regardless

I'll probably try to get a bot to purge non pinned messages in the chat and have the prompt pinned
do you not have winner voting?
Switched it off since i didn't really want it in that channel
how will people know who they are playing if you delete that message?
Still trying to figure that out lol
Thanks for the help regardless I'll mess around a bit more to see if I can make something work
yea, thats why that message is sent lol
also, if you want that channel clean, you should use /tempchannels
+ change the /resultschannel
Mhm just switched to that, threads + temp channels would be best 

Will also switch the result channel
yep you can do threads if u didnt see
Yep just switched it on
Yeah this is almost perfectly working out for me

Thanks a lot!
<@145305657237700608> how can i set a decay in mmr for every 4 days that someone won't play?
`/mmr decay`
what should i put for 5 days?
5 days is 432000 seconds
does mmr decay happen automatically or only if a player doesn't queue up? in 5 days?
Is there a way to remove a reaction role for spectator role? I can only find an add command
where did the remove command go‚Ä¶
<@145305657237700608>
only if they don‚Äôt play a game
so i dont need to use /add graceperiod anymore?
thats only if you want people to skip the decay
wdym by skip the decay
the add graceperiod command gives someone extra time
so if you give them 1 day graceperiod, they wont decay for an extra day
is there a way that the whole party team gets elo and not the individual players
<@145305657237700608>
^ like a team leaderboard for a queue with premade teams
and generally a way to have set teams / clans that can join a queue together
there is currently no team based mmr, it‚Äôs all individual
is that a thing u could add in the future? ik the bot is primarily focused on individual elo, but a team based mmr system would still be great
perhaps, although i would consider that very low priority
Would it be hard to add something where you can start a que, then force start it, and it randomly picks people? Maybe have the ability to give certain roles increased odds
i‚Äôm not sure if i see the use case in that really
For servers that want one match going at a time and all games are streamed
ye but it‚Äôs usually first come first serve
Do predictions only work when another person predicts the other team?
yea points can only be gained by people who lost
no points are created in a prediction
Back again!

Enacted those changes (Config saved to ZPVFK)

Almost everything is good except for the double ping when the second user joins the queue, any way to disable it?
hey is there a way to report a non drop - for what ever reason a drop did not take place ?
what‚Äôs a drop?
i don‚Äôt recall that being on purpose, i‚Äôll test the code and see
Sorry a match / game
what happened with it?
ah, this is an issue with using Threads i didnt realize, but i can fix it
Thats great to hear!
fixed now
good find
That was rapid, thanks for the quick patch!!
Like team 2 guys client crashed, is there a way for the players to report a canceled game
oh gotcha, they can use /cancel
Ok cool, will add that too the Lobby info- tooo many boomers when it comes to discord commands haha
might help if you goto your server's integrations, and hide all the non-relevant commands for normal users
Is it possible to set like a queue timer for the lock? Basically only want it to be unlocked 2 days a week or would I need to do it manually?
currently you can only lock at certain times, not certain days
Ok Ty
im having trouble with the leaderboard command
its not pulling up the leaderboard
whats it doing?
its not pulling up
its saying no queue found
but its the only queue we have
Heis Hills?
yes sir
you have 2 queues in that server
#elo-8s and #test-elo-channel
i just ended the test one
im trying to get the elo-8s one working so in the leaderboard thread, i typed / leaderboard MW2
am i typing the command wrong
just do /leaderboard
thank you
can i reset the leaderboard points?
so everyone is at 0 points for the start
figured it out sorry im being annoying
last question, can you have multiple queues running at the same time named the same thing
so the leaderboard works
yup if they are named the same, it will be a shared leaderboard
cool
<@145305657237700608>  is there any information on the mmr system and how it works, what it is based on, how it works out how much for a win / lost
its based on the chess ELO system but with a good bit of customization by me to account for team stuff
Yeah they where asked how the MMR changes and adds MMR, I guess that the custom section of the code as that does not happen with ELO
wdym does not happen with ELO
Is ELO not zero sum ?
i believe so, but my system is not
since there are placement multipliers
Aww got ya
Are they turned on by default and how long do they last
yes default and for first 10 games
Sweet thanks, the guys seem to love the bot the main request is for a mirror match, would there a way to set this up ? Eg they bring the same (hero/ mech)
how would the hero be picked?
my resultschannel command is not working like i want to. I've set it to put results in match-history channel which neatqueue has access to but it still shows it in its queue chat
that would be the /staffchannel
that is a staff-only message, /resultschannel is the normal results
Atm this way - https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1808413634
i see, what would the alternative approach be?
that woud be nice
Is there a way to have the queue be a set number or played (for example 10), but in the draft portion only 8 get drafted?
no sorry, everyone in the queue will play
That‚Äôd be a good feature to develop in the future
idk seems like a strange concept to have
where people will just not be able to play
So for Call of Duty, we usually have 8s lobbies (4v4) but usually it‚Äôs 10+ players and the teams get drafted. There are two roles so sometimes when you only get 8 in a queue there are people that have to play out of position where if you did it how they normal do some just wouldn‚Äôt get picked
Usually there are multiple games going on at once so if you don‚Äôt get picked in one, you just go to the other
Sometimes you just prefer some players over others
I think if we could have the same thing as map banning but custom would be great ( like could have 2/3 of them back to back )
Follow up question if i turn this on - /leaderboardconfig monthly, but have rolling as an option.. what will that output as ?
you can use /hero or /votingmenu for more control
it will show monthly leaderboards, but there wont be any reset at the end of the month
is their a way to show round outcome so if a team wins 13-7 it'll say that and the total rounds played in the winner message
Currently the bot allows people to requeue once theyve individually voted for their previous match. Is there a way I can make it so the match vote has to be concluded and then they can requeue?
Instead of people joining the queue as soon as theyve voted
yep change the /requeue condition
not currently, matches are just won or loss, no other data there
can I change the nick that someone has in the queue / team selection?
by default it's his discord name
but can I manually change it?
if you nickname them they would work by default
thanks
Yeah I could not get it to output to the same as map ban, I try again tho
turning it on has killed our leader board - https://www.neatqueue.com/lb/MWOCOMP
hmm turning on monthly can be a bit strange since existing stats won‚Äôt be seen the same way as monthly stats
yeah we cont use the leader board at all now its just blank in discord and the url
does the leaderboard show a month in discord?
if you can switch it to All Time
Yeah only the month
Anyone who wants to drop has to register again
How do you do this
did you change the queue name?
Nope
i would just disable monthly sorry, i‚Äôm unable to investigate the issue
Yeah won‚Äôt send haha
Aww just very slow
if it responded it should have toggled off
Got there in the end
just a discord issue
Cool it‚Äôs back to normal
Looks like monthly is bugged
monthly in general is fine, probs an issue with using Rolling from a non monthly queue
since rolling just uses the last months stats
Yeah it‚Äôs like it created a new Q name but then nothing worked
So if I wanted to go monthly, is there a correct way to do it ( happy to wipe)
that‚Äôs basically how it works under the hood currently
but yea enabling monthly works, it might be messed up with linking the existing stats
Ok sweeet I try it again at the end of the month ( just before)
Hey, how do we get more specific elo gain/loss with as you get/lose elo?
Does this bot have that type of customizability
yes you can customize the /mmr change
how could i fix this. i made another server to use the bot in and it started not sticking to the bottom. its not messing up in my main server
it‚Äôs an issue that affects certain servers randomly, should be fixed now at least temporarily
thats not what i was meaning
i was just saying i made a new server and the bot was having issues in it while its fine in my main
yea exactly
it‚Äôs affects certain servers randomly
oh wait my bad i misread i thought i read its not an issue
nah it‚Äôs definitely an issue haha
i just can‚Äôt find the cause
discord just really doesnt want your messages staying at the bottom lolol
yeaaaa
you know it‚Äôs a hard bug to find when restarting the bot fixes it
i was wondering if a mod could help me setup for my public discord, if theyre able to dm that would be great ty
What‚Äôs error code UFXRK
same as <#1079499165203177543>
unfortunately i cannot today
would there be any day any of the mods could help me im just struggling to set up basic commands right now lmao
I was wondering if I could get some help setting up my bot in my server. I'm struggling to setup the queue in my server
Would you be able to today
Is the premium a subskription.
hi how do i make it show how many people are currently in queue?
/need
i meant in the window itself
not very sure what you mean by that
is there a way to remove someone from the leaderboard
it shows queue 1/10 here
you would have to reset their stats
or give them a leaderboard ignored role
Would be easier if you could ask questions regarding confusion you face
same thing for you <@582563804949381120>
Neatz do you know another que bot that is free
from what i‚Äôve seen, other bots follow similar free models
NeatQueue allows more free players than others
What do you mean with free players
i‚Äôve seen a cap of 100 players usually, i give 500
What do you mean with cap of 100 players
on the leaderboard
Ok but can you name a another que bot that is free
no sorry, will only recommend neatqueue for that
Can you please in dm
when you set a lobby channel, it will dump the players into that channel after the match finishes
not automatically, at least not currently
best you can do is /lobbychannel pullall
so it will pull everyone in the channel when the queue is full
it‚Äôs not a 1v1 right?
if it was only you, then it defaults the team name to the player's name
it will always create a new voice channel
the lobbychannel is separate
they will get pulled into the new temporary channel
the lobbychannel set command is used to drop them after
<@145305657237700608> unfortunately there‚Äôs no error code but people in the server are saying that the bot isn‚Äôt auto dragging people into vcs
into the team voice channels?
when the q channel becomes full it says no one joined the vc and temporarily bans everyone
^ worked previously but now it dodges people even when they joined the queue channel
<@145305657237700608>
I reset the pullall to enabled when it was enabled and reset the dodge timer and it worked this time
but it didnt throw us in attacker/defender just kicked us
how is the initial mmr systen setup and how can i change it? i initially wanted the winning team to get +50 and loser to get +25, the mmr change set command didnt seem to do anything
exactly
currently those channel names can‚Äôt be changed
that command would be the fix for it
yup just make sure you name the queues the same and they will share a leaderboard
<@145305657237700608> quick question is the premium rates monthly or just flat rate
And are the packages upgradable so if you get 20 package now it'll only be an extra 10 to upgrade to 30 version layer
it‚Äôs monthly and easy to change plans
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/910981294937210930/1088321291385311232 this is probs the best explanation currently
yes exactly
if they all have the same name it will work
as long as you don‚Äôt have some leaderboardconfig to hide some role or something
i have problems buying credits on the website, i need premium for the amount of queues i have
i click opurchase and nothing happens
<@145305657237700608> what determines a user as "being in the system" for the 1000 player max
if they have a game played
should open a new url
it doesnt
or the url thats opened is (neatqueue.com/manage/undefined)
is there another way to pay?
sry for all these questions but id like to finish my server today üòÖ
<@145305657237700608>
So this queue works with fill, having 2 roles and a fill and if all 6 are fill it'll assign people, can someone explain *why* this works exactly? I can't figure out how to get it to do it for another queue. WCEAH
i‚Äôm not quite following
no but i‚Äôll check out why it‚Äôs not working
ight, lmk once it works again
Currently this queue has a team size of 3, but the roles are *Goalie, Forward, Forward, Flex, Flex, Flex*, however if you load the queue and set the team size to 3 (same as it currently is...) it resets the roles, how did this queue config get it to work the way it currently works?
yea the number of roles should match the team size
I wonder how this config is so scuffed where you can do the opposite of that lol
after a game ends, is there a way to make it so people move to a certain vc? at one point in my discord this was working (when a game ended, people would be moved to a vc in a above category altogether). however, now it seems like once a game ends people arent moved to that vc. idk if i changed a setting or cause i changed something in my discord server.
that would be /lobbychannel set
yea that would be unintentional iirc
<@145305657237700608> on the leaderboard it shows only 200 people but it says we exceeded the 500 limit for free subscription
oops i said the wrong thing, it counts all players who currently have stats, which are first assigned upon queuing
Am I know able to buy credits?
i gave it a shot and had no issue so maybe?
isnt working for me
any chance you can enable premium for my server manually and i send you the money elswhere?
<@145305657237700608>
i just want to give you my money lol
it‚Äôs just not opening the stripe checkout page?
exactly
nothing is happening after i click purchase
how can i remove the ban system?
i added the ban system but i wont to delete it
how do you make your whole party join the queue?
i made this
but how can i delete all the maps
i mean the hole map ban system
'/map remove'
id think
but than i remove only 1 map
Hello
Is there a way to make people use reactions to confirm their check in
instead of joining the voice chat?
Because joining voice chat is pretty annoying to some people
I just bought the premium bot package so i hope i can get a quick support
thanks
voice channel is optional u can disable it
who can i delete the map voting?
how do you have 1 leaderboard for two queues together?
Both Queues need the same name
then how do you reset everyone‚Äôs stats
Not sure but I think if you rename both queues and create a new leaderboard it should be reset
thanks
/map remove
Remove all your maps you add earlier
you can remove all with /map remove all
<@145305657237700608>
How can I enable party queue? I've tried w /partyqueue enable but that just pops up the display if how I want to queue and when I click the options it doesn't do a6
Anything
sure you can pay however you want
create a party with /party create
Doesn't work
doesn‚Äôt work?
Yeah, I have a menu displayed with two options to join the queue: solo queue or <party name>
Clicking either triggers no response
only this type of thing and then it stops doing the dot animation thingy
whenever i queue without being in a party im able to join the queue:
does it say interaction failed?
nope
this is what i see in order
give me a paypal in the DMs
if it doesn‚Äôt send the button click, and never says interaction failed, that would have to be discord related
if it‚Äôs always loading in the button
Is there any way to fix it?
i‚Äôm not sure since i haven‚Äôt seen that
restart client?
done that
What timezone does the bot use for monthly leaderboards?
i want people to check in
but i dont want them to join voice chat
Like react to a message to confirm check in
abt the reactions, use yagpbd or whatever its called
it‚Äôs all UTC
currently there is no other way to do check ins besides enable/disable the voice channels
When doing captains draft, is there a way to see what roles people queued for? Something like {DPS} IGN, {TANK} IGN?
if you used /roles that‚Äôs how it should show up
<@145305657237700608> how do i make users only have user commands? whenever i enable application commands, users have access to not only admin commands for the neatqueue bot but also for all other bots (i have manage channel permissions off)
since the commands allow to be setup with staff roles, they can‚Äôt be hidden on my end (the discord API doesn‚Äôt support this) so you will need to manually hide them
how do u do that
i cant find anything in the doc
in your servers Integration settings
you can toggle command permissions
us there a way so certain roles get more elo than others?
trying to reset the MMR but when i enter the command it asks for a queue name.. the leaderboard doesnt have a name... or queue name
anyone can help?
if you type it in the queue channel, you don‚Äôt need to say the name
but it does have a queue name
not currently
i tried
i dont see a que name...
where would it be
in the queue message
or leaderboard message
or /info
Unexpected error occurred, this has been recorded
^this is the error i get when i enter the command
for /info
Did it and nothing there gave me the info towards a queue name.. so.. every time I try to reset it, it gives me the error.
what command is giving you an error
/ reset mmr
And it gives me the error no matter what I put in it. Just says thinking then error..
Anyone here can show me a video or something of what to do and or look for to reset the mmr ?
can you send the error you see?
How can you check who bans or unbans a person from Q?
you can check in the /logs
the queue hasn't been sticking to the bottom since yesterday afternoon, figured it would fix itself by now but no luck
Could someone here help me?
what with?
The work around I had to do was to /endqueue and then reload a saved config afterwards.
is there any way to make the bot @ the players when the game starts?
it already tags them when the room creates but, i want it to tag them when the game starts
like after the teams are made?
no that‚Äôs not a thing but that‚Äôs small enough that i can add if you suggest in <#911057745204105237>
thank you for the fast response, i'll suggest it
the queue usually defaults to the bottom of chat so it's always sseen
what do we do if it doesn't do that?
can someone help me make a leaderboard using netqueue if anyone is available thank you
can u restart the bot, channels are again on top in the dc server
done
wdym?
how do i force cancel a game?
/outcome cancel
Hello there, does the bot have the only works with admin hardcoded because you give them the perms it needs and just straight up refuse to work
Is there a way to allow spectators role to talk in voice channels? currently it automutes and does not allow them to talk is there an admin permission that can overide this for certain users
when you add a spectator role you can set the can_speak argument
hello guys, how can i create a queue for duels and not get the team selection step when i join a queue
is there a toggle for this ?
please reply so i pay attention for notification thanks
ehhh nevermind it's /partyqueue command üòÑ
yea or (for players) just leave all your parties
how to fix this
10 people in que
but it never starts
new issue or never worked?
also it‚Äôs matchmaking so they must be similar rated
apparently happened last night also
just worked
is there a way to make which captain gets first pick RNG? between the two selected. I understand that 1st pick gets the best player but if there are 5 high elo closely rated players and 5 low players players 2nd pick gets 3 "good players" and first only gets 2
hi
Is there a function to delete the number of people or names during the matching search?
I'm having trouble with people not making matches or quitting when they see the number of people in the search.
by default the matchmaking queue type will hide players, but you can toggle manually via /anonymousqueue
the first pick is always currently the player with less MMR
Thank you.
It was very helpful!!

I have an additional question, is there a feature to be able to select the join button for solo or duo in the same matchmaking in a 5vs5 match?
are you asking how to join as a duo?
<@145305657237700608> 
Can we have a button that allows solo or duo entry, and in the case of a duo, can we have the same team?
(The teaming is set to be balanced).
how can i fix this error code "KEFCN"
if you are testing, use /test and join multiple times
instead of force starting with 1 player
and captains selection
how can i get started
when i use /setup
it doesnt work in my discord
make sure the bot has permissions in that channel
and it should pop up
what role does the bot need
admin?
nope it asks for the default perms when you invite
just make sure it has perms in the channel
can you set individual players mmrs ?
<@145305657237700608>
yes /set mmr
<@145305657237700608>
can u help me ?
depends on what lol
i cant get my map ban system to work
i keep trying to like set it so the team captains will be able to ban maps
but the match just starts without ever mentioning a map

Is there a robot that enters people randomly?
team
And is there a moov for each team?
what?
I have the same issue
should be fixed temporarily
this is done
Hey, points system on my server is not working as i setuped, i mean it doesnt drop points from players who lost the match. Is there any way to fix this?

Also suffix format doesnt work for some players
It also gives a random mmr to the players who won the match, unlike what I did
did you modify the point rewards?
wdym random mmr
Yeah
well what did you change them to
Doesnt drops points for losses, and gives 30 points for winners. Idk if i did right
it‚Äôs 20 points average
they might have the placements or streak multiplier
if you want it to always be exactly 20, do /mmr change set 20 static:True
also make sure you set /points change loss
Ohh alright, should i disable placements and streaks tho?
it won‚Äôt matter if you set it to static
Alright thank you
Ah final thing, suffix format. It works on some but not on others
If I do it manually, will the bot run them? Or there something to on it
like they don‚Äôt have any suffix at all?
Yeah even though they played queue
They have points but don't show up next to their names, it appears in some
I have this enabled
do they have very long names?
Nope
random team
<@145305657237700608> ?
does the bot have permissions to rename them?
and they have queued, right?
you can do random teams with /teamselection
I give admin perms to bot
Lee Voice
is there anything moving the voice ?
<@145305657237700608>
I checked yep
the bot will automatically move to voice channels
He doesn't
the team channels ?
make sure it has perms then
otherwise i can‚Äôt help look into it currently sorry
im having a similar issue to this
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/868549627652214794/1088259583044235375

basically i need to vote for the outcome of the match, but there is no option to vote for it
was the winner for the match already decided?
i think we did not choose a winner. way later on we cancelled it.
wait no i think we voted it looks like
hmm ok what server ID?
1041942937610760282
try now?
it works. thank you!
Hii first 2 page not loading on leaderboard, any way to fix this?
looks like the image url is dead, click refresh?
i did still same
Is there anyway I can give people an Unranked role, before a person enters the queue they get an auto role "Unranked" and then as soon as they queue a match the bot will automatically give them the "Silver" role or something like that...
if they win/loss their mmr will be updated
if that makes any sense
you can use /autoroles mmr for giving specific roles based on mmr
right but can I auto role someone "Unranked" (default set to 1000mmr), But as soon as they hop into the queue/win/lose a game the bot will set them to "Bronze" (0-700mmr) or if they win "Silver"  (1100-1299mmr)
And the unranked role will be automatically taken away from the user
Because right now, if a person doersnt get into queue they will have no role what so ever but I would like the bot to give them the unranked role
not currently i can‚Äôt think of a way
but that is a good use case
damn
I dont want to auto role "Unranked" to everyone cus then they will have "Bronze" and "Unranked"
well if you had some way to assign everyone the Unranked role when they join
you could set the Unranked mmr threshold to be like -1000
so when they queue, they get their starting mmr, and it would remove Unranked
thats genius tysm
let me test it out
but i don‚Äôt have a way to auto give the Unranked role to everyone who isn‚Äôt rated
i‚Äôm sure some bot can though
or make it the default role or something
yeah a "deafult" role feature
Also in the documentation it said something about placement matches??
it was only stated when talking about multipliers
but I can not find anything else in regards to placements
that‚Äôs the only mention of it
there is a small multiplier for your first 10 matches
I see
the only issue of this is that if someone hits queue for the first time but then they back out they get the "silver" role and the "unranked" goes away
but thats honestly very minimal
yea that‚Äôs since you get your starting mmr when you click queue
honestly that can probs be changed
its all good
Can staff roles without admin permissions change bot/queue settings?
yes, the required permission for the bot is Manage Channels, or have the /staffrole
Ohh thats not good then, thank you
you can get more control by modifying your servers integration settings, but the bot will still require at least the manage channel perm
Is there a solution to this problem?
someone must have ended the queue, you need to either /load the config or do /setup
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/608711499208458260/1055282514735939594/A9B537F0-1677-46F8-B1E6-112DC7729141.gif

what happens if you /endqueue?
Is it possible to add Valorant ranks in the que?¬† We run valorant 10 man, We always have the captains¬†pick the players but sometimes the team is not fair. By the way, Thank you for this Bot.
do you mean assigning ranks based on MMR?
if you just mean for captains to see ranks when they are picking, then not really, the only thing they can see is the MMRs
Valorant Rank makes it easier to pick players based on their rank.  We have MMR enabled but it doesn't help with the new player cus we have MMR set to 1000.
there isn‚Äôt really a way since it‚Äôs a totally different rating system
unless you reset stats and did /requireregister Valorant
which would initialize player MMR using their valorant rating
Cool, I will try that next month. Is it possible to give the player a rank manually  next to the MMR ?  For example Jamesdean (1250) Gold     Jamesdean (1100) Plat   Jamesdean (950) Imm  Jamesdean (1155) Dia
no in pretty much every case it‚Äôll just show the MMR
how do you fix this?
did you already vote?
it only needs 6 ppl to vote so they didnt vote but the winner was selected
ok what server ID?
1108101661441933472
ok should be good
tysm
Thank you for your time and Help, I appreciated.
how can I change the maps in my map choice from the config for rainbow six siege
/map remove and /map add
Hey I need help pls
<@145305657237700608> <@857633321064595466>
Any way to resolve this?
I DM'd you
So I am a little confused about the credits thing
I am thinking about buying premium for 5 dollars
but it says I don't have any credits
But it doesn't say how many credits I need to buy it, only the dollar amount
also, is it a one time purchase, or a subscription?
someone banned you with /player ban
it‚Äôs kinda like a subscription, you can extend your premium by 30 days
the premium prices are in credits also
The bot doesn't cancel the q after voting for cancellation. We have to do it manually. How can i fix it?
the vote had a majority saying yes?
6-0 and it still doesn't cancel the q
can you show the vote?
Well next time they try to cancel I'll take ss
the bot jus doesnt register there is 10 people and doesnt start the queue / game when its full
its a recurring issue and requires a moderator to forcestart the queue
what‚Äôs ur config code
if u /save
i dont have permission to do that
oh you will need your server staff to help then
i imagine you have a matchmaking queue, but players aren‚Äôt in a fair mmr range so the match doesn‚Äôt start
yeah theres people like 700 higher than others
yep that would do it
suggest your staff to change the /queuetype to PUGs
it won‚Äôt care about rating, will always start
the bot working?
I am having the same issue
you have the same setup?
oh the bot is missing perms in your server
if i set the points gained by a win why are people getting different mmr for winning?
i set it to 50 and then ppl are gaining all different amounts
points or mmr?
MMR and Points are 2 different things.
The bot's default is 50 MMR and 100 points per win.
MMR won/loss varies slightly depending on the variance setting, which is 1600 by default.
If you want the MMR given to always be exactly 50, you need to enable the "Static" option using "/mmr change set".
perfect explanation ü§ù
gave it to you
do you have a list of exact perms required in its role?
<@145305657237700608> same thing happened again
well for that you need to closeout 297170 queue by voting on the winner, or canceling outcome
the default ones it asks for when it joins the server
just make sure your category or channel isn‚Äôt overriding it
I gave it all default perms
I did edit category perms and then granted explicity the role (neatbot created one) and neatbot itself permissions to the category but it doesnt respect it?
category perms override given perms
try again and i can tell you which perm
1108101661441933472 thats the server ID
is there a way we can fix it on our end?
fixed
Probably not necessary, but I recommend giving the bot Admin permission. I did it and have not had any further perms issues.
i thought i fixed the issue but ig not, although this issue cant happen with /tempchannels enabled
so that  can be a temp fix
<@501560183818813470> yeah I could give it, but bad practice, should have min perms required to function
yep it does not need admin
btw the bot grants itself only these permissions on brand new discord
so on my discord it is overprovisioned anyway, I do have /tempchannels
not related to your issue, its a different one
perhaps discord bug?
nope
bot cant create channels in your category
let me dm you all perms
i don‚Äôt really need them lol
that‚Äôs the perm that it doesn‚Äôt have
it‚Äôs an error from discord itself
hey, is the bot broken?
the queue channels are going into the incorrect places
and players aren't automatically being sent to their vcs
shouldn't be on top
seems like it yea
one sec
help
related to the above randomly occurring bug, restarting now
Fixed, tysm goat :)
Tried resetting all stats this morning but mmr and leaderboard have not changed.
Any idea why?
what did you try?
do you have monthly on ?
Nope
I have been manually resetting every 2 weeks
is the queue name correct?
yeah i copied and pasted it
hmm it should work in that case
reminds me, i need to add auto complete for that command

/voicechannels mode
And how i turn off this?
/reshuffle
And how do i turn this off
<@145305657237700608>
turn off game modes?
nah i want game modes to be there but i want that the bot chooses random which gamemode+ map
change the /map selection
set map and gamemode to random
Thx also how do i add like ranks? And the mmr range for it
that‚Äôs /autoroles
is there a way i can rename a queue thats already been made?
my players still facing the bug üò≠
right now, or like 15 hours ago?
<@145305657237700608> to add ranks do i need to create the roles before and then use /autoroles
the roles must exist already yes
<@145305657237700608> i added all ranks but when i join the q i get the highest rank and not the lowest
How to fix?
check your /info
you must be in the threshold
You need to set the range for each rank using ‚Äú/autoroles mmr set‚Äù. It has options for upper and lower rating.
Bot has been doing this a lot recently
why does the bot keep putting messages on other channels
can it just be used in one category
yea, it‚Äôs the same issue that‚Äôs been coming up for a while, haven‚Äôt been home to try and find out why
i would turn off /player autoban until it‚Äôs fully fixed
things like channels being in the wrong category and queue message not sticking to bottom are definitely annoying, but don‚Äôt really block games
Also it's glitching like giving unexpected errors and then cannot cancel q despite being 6-0 votes to cancel
the error comes from the attempt to cancel?
No that was just a random error after they selected team Captains
It didn't continue to allow them to choose players anymore
that was today?
Just now
ok i‚Äôll take a look later
based on the time that i sent the ss, its 3h+ ago during that time
yea i would disable auto bans for now
might disable it for everyone
I have disabled it however it needs to be fixed soon it's been days since the bots doing this
no timeline on a fix cuz i haven‚Äôt found any cause yet
i banned some players from my discord and they're still on the leaderboard. can't use /resetstats player [user] because this command requires someone's @ to function properly, and since they are no longer in the discord i cannot @ them. how do i get players banned from my discord server off the neatq lbs?
<@145305657237700608> any ideas?
you can use their discord ID to mention them, but the easiest fix is add @ everyone as a /rolerequirement
mention like <@1233221>
ah how do i get their id?
nvm the @ everyone worked
<@145305657237700608> hi is there a way to vote for mode?
wdym
U know u can vote for maps
But can u vote for modes?
yes via /map selection
you can set map_choice and gamemode_choice
K ill try
hey im having this same issue on the same server, if you can help that'd be appreicated
image if it helps
fixed
thanks!
Is the bot down?
Everyone is saying you cannot use it
‚ÄúThis interaction failed‚Äù
Oh nvm
I saw that it was down
Yeah apparently it's down
When is the bot fixxed?
<@145305657237700608>
sry for pinging
When is the bot comming back??
prolly in like
a bit
usually down for a few min but it;s been down for longer
so idk
Alright, thanks for the reply
Still down?
btw you got twitter
<@145305657237700608> hey does the /requeue priority only apply to requeues or does the priority role also work for regular queueing?
the priority is always given, but for regular queues it doesn‚Äôt change anything really
if you check the docs link i posted, it outlines the times when priority does change stuff
cool thanks!
our queue is matchmaking so this should be perfect
reading the docs, this doesn't affect ONLY requeues right?
even tho the command is /requeue
if x role has priority 10000 then regular matchmaking queues will use their priority rating right?
yea, it‚Äôs currently under the requeue subcommand, but it‚Äôs not only related to requeues
will be moved when i free up a slot
anytime someone queues, they will get any deserved priority
<@145305657237700608> is it possible to change the name of team 1 and 2?
/teamnames
is there a way to make the queues best of 3?
yup /bestof
Is there a way to prevent the queue chat from being deleted when all players leave?
bot died
not currently at least
how come you would want that?
This would actually be nice for my server as well. Sometimes players are messing around and leave the voice channel, then it gets deleted because they didnt know that would happen. Kind of breaks things since I dont want spectators to be allowed to speak and interfere with the game. Its only happened a handful of times for us, but if the channel didn't instantly delete it would prevent that
what if i switch it so that when the channel is emptied, it deletes itself after 5 minutes of being empty?
or, the channels don‚Äôt need to be deleted since they are deleted when the match ends
Yeah either of those would work for me. I dont see why channels would need to be deleted when people leave the channel, unless this is just a fail-safe
it‚Äôs very very old behavior, but channels now pretty much always get cleaned up
mainly so if people forget to vote for the winner, the channels are still deleted
Makes sense. For my use I couldnt imagine anyone forgetting to vote, especially since we have an ingame role and people start pinging it to vote a few seconds after the game ends lol
lol yea i think i‚Äôll just go with the delayed approach
can you add images to the queue ?
images for what?
a custom image, for like the game
oh like in the main queue message?
yeah
currently no
but that would be cool
i‚Äôll add it to /queuemessage
yeah just to make it look nice, you know
idk if that's possible, but it would be nice if you can set it up as a custom embed
yep it‚Äôs possible
like this bot for example
yep i can do the same thing
i have temp channels on, is there a way for the bot to move everyone back to the vc they were in previously before deleting the vc?
and how can i make it so the bot moves everyone into the vc?
oh jk nvm
we got it
Hey neat
is there any command that prevents players with special role to join queue?
I know there is "/rolerequirement add"
every time i try to forcestart a queue pops out a msg where it saying that the program is not responding
can somebody help me?
i must‚Äôve missed something
you can use /forcestart cooldown to fix yourself
thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
sorry didn‚Äôt see, but you can add a banned role
with /bannedroles
wtf these guys r cheating
<@145305657237700608>
ban them the top 2
plz talk to your server staff
if the staff did not do it, then feel free to reach out again
I‚Äôm looking to purchase the enterprise plan, but it‚Äôs raining something about credits. Do I buy $30 worth of credits or 30 credits?
<@145305657237700608>
the premium plans are purchased using credits
So 30 credits?
yea for 30 days
Is there a way to limit the amount of times a match can reroll for random teams?
hmmm not currently
that can be added to reshuffle
you should add it fr
because people just keep rerolling until they get an OP team
Don't see this in the docs - is there functionality to set a specific role to gain a multiplier (1.2x) mmr more than others?
no :/ but i do want to add that actually
i can probs do it tomorrow
that would be amazing
In that case, just change the queue type and let everyone join with the team they want. Or you can also use the PUG queue type and set the bot to balance teams by MMR or roles.
Alright, thank you!
yea or just disable reshuffling lol
I was wondering, how do you setup the bot, where I can choose teams with the captains
just run /setup
if you want captains only, then change ur /teamselection
alright bet tysm!
after voting for a winner, can I make the winner message appear in the temporary queue channel? or can disable it?
why is it unknown ?
that means you somehow don‚Äôt have access
you can ‚Äúdisable it‚Äù by sending it to a hidden channe
lol how? am the owner
sorry, how do I do that? üòÖ
I read the docs but I couldn't find it
There is no option to disable it. You could just set it up so the message is sent to a private channel not visible to members. You should have a private channel already where the results for staff are sent. You could set up the winner message in that channel as well using "/resultschannel".
yep exactly, the bot makes sure it sends the message somewhere currently
so even if the specified channel was deleted, it‚Äôll fallback to the queue channel
yeah it worked, thanks guys
one more question, what about rematch?
is it always with the winner message? can I send it to the temporary queue channel?
no it‚Äôs always in that message
the temp channel will be deleted
is the #unknown channel supposed to be the temporary queue channel?
yea i‚Äôve never seen that
maybe the channel was already deleted?
nevermind, got fixed by itself lol
Is there a command to reset all games, but keep the settings ?
wdym reset all games?
can change when the temporary queue channel close after picking winner ?
Each queues has different points and mmr system? I mean, if I create two different queues, will they be saved as points in same, or will they be saved in different?
separate unless you link them
Bot wont work for me, any ideas?
wait how?
oh nice then ty
restart discord?
tried didnt work
points are shared, mmr is not UNLESS the queues have the same name
/reshuffle
TYSM
Stats are tied to the queue name, so MMR from 2 different queues go to the same leaderboard only if both queues have the same name.
I assume you are referring to the stats for all players in the leaderboard? In that case, use ‚Äú/resetstats all‚Äù. You can also use ‚Äú/save‚Äù to save the queue configuration before messing with anything else.
reminds me
can change when the temporary queue channel close after picking winner ?
<@145305657237700608> can i get some help on this^
no it will insta delete currently
can u run the command again
Ill run it rn
Did you give the bot all the perms it requested?
it's not about perms
did you run the command?>
yes and it didn't work
im not seeing the command even being run
you can invite me and ill try
I messaged you
<@145305657237700608> how do i wipe leaderboards?
either `/resetstats` or change the queue name
Season 1, Season 2, etc is common
the bot is not sending the queue interface
attempted to start another queue with the same name to try to get the bot to send the interface, but also did not work
the message below shows the previous queue channel with the last game that occurred with the next message from an admin
<@145305657237700608>
bot missing perms
gotcha
Hey all, currently in our PSO server when a queue pops it creates a private queue channel that only staff and people in that match can see. Is there a way to further edit how these channels are created? Ideally we would like to give all other members of the server the ability to view the queue channel but not type in it
We want to make it so people could know if there is a queue in progress
if there are games going on?
you can give category access for everyone to view
but disable the category permission to connect to the vcs
neatqueue generates it as a private channel in a category where everyone can see the channels
Still only the staff and players in that match can view it
for the text channel you would need to add a spectator role
for the voice channels you can edit the permissions of the category
/spectatorrole lets you add a role that can see the channels but not speak/type
Gotcha, thank you
Is it a known issue that you can't view leaderboards in a browser? Clicking on the URL in the leaderboards just leads to this
can you paste the URL
https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/1047301076866580500/1103549538041610271
Is there any way to delete queue? Not meaning ending queue, delete completely
The ones I've ended still show up on leaderboard
yea, stats are stored separate than the queue, so the stats will remain
thanks i see the same issue, will check it out
i assume this is a monthly leaderboard?
is there any work around making leaderboard hidden? like only show if I press a button or something / hidden message that shows the leaderboard
its a regular/alltime. I just happened to reset stats yesterday
No, anyone in your server can see it using ‚Äú/leaderboard‚Äù. Only thing you can do is disable the perm ‚ÄúUse Application Commands‚Äù in all channels, but then members will not be able to use any bot commands at all.
Use ‚Äú/resetstats all‚Äù and the ‚Äúqueue_name‚Äù option.
thanks. would be cool to have an option (enable/disable) to show a leaderboard button in queue and when you press it the leaderboard pop out in a hidden message
fixed, thanks
ill add a hidden argument to /leaderboard
idk why it doesnt have one
Something like the ‚Äú/statsbutton‚Äù I guess. That would be nice.
I didn't know about this one, very cool! yep exactly like this but would be nice if I can make it hidden (just like queue status button / Only you can see this)
You can actually set up the stats button to show as a hidden message using ‚Äú/hidestats‚Äù
Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè
Can we configure this bot in Stage Channels?
hello everyoneüôèüèæ
i‚Äôve never tried, but it seems like no
i‚Äôm seeing errors from your server üôÇ
thank you. this would be very useful because im starting to stream and want members to queue to play games with me or organize custom matches in the stage channel
great bot though for sure
honestly i‚Äôve never even used a stage channel so idk what they look like
is there a chat?
if you can get ahead of a rush you would be a front runner of an important niche
yes it has a chat
<@145305657237700608>
seeing if i can find a work around by starting the queue in a text channel and then use command "/link" maybe
the queue itself would only be in that text channel
ill investigate the changes needed to get it to work in a stage channel
ahhhh i see
is there a command to list the current queue? in a seperate channel?
its a new change, i need to update library versions, should work implicitly
nope, queues are channel specific
oh okay will it be a long time before this would happen? i know your very busy with more improtant things
would command /link adjust this in any way?
i might try upgrading tonight, depends on the number of breaking changes
and no, /link only lets you execute commands from other channels
i would love to be a beta run for you. please let me know if i can help in any way.
oh okay thank you
looks like i should be able to upgrade without any issues, i‚Äôll test it in a bit and likely update later
ill be available whenever
I gotta hand it to you. You‚Äôre the most responsive discord developer I have ever seen. Great bot so far and keeps getting better with all these user suggestions you‚Äôre implementing. üëåüèª
lol just cuz i‚Äôm between graduation and work, next few days i won‚Äôt be as available
congratulations!
thanks!
Congrats!

 I‚Äôll keep on checking this channel to help out users on non-technical questions I can answer to lighten your workload by 0.5% at least ü§£ I wouldn‚Äôt want this bot to stop working as my server fully depends on it!
appreciate the question answering üòÄ
<@145305657237700608> I can't upgrade to premium, even though I got the role here? sorry for ping
what is preventing you?
"Unauthorized"
I have Credits: 5.6
you are staff for the server?
if so, i would just logout and log back in
Unauthorized on the website not discord
yea logout on the website
nervermind, it works now
yeah I did that, thanks
okay so, I wanna make team vs team queue, but I just wanna make the queue find a match like if its 1v1 (cause the team search is little complicated so I wanna make it simple) - so I made the team size to 1 but the thing is vc channel is locked to 1 , anywork around this?
the intended way for this to work is set the team size to the actual team size
yeah but to join the queue I need to create a prty right?
give it a shot
its the only way to get everyone in the system and on the same team
if you disable `/channel restrictions` the user limit will go away, but anyone will be able to join
how to backup a queue
You mean saving the queue configuration? Use ‚Äú/save‚Äù.
Then if you want to setup another queue with that same configuration, use ‚Äú/load‚Äù and copy/paste the code it gave you when you saved it.
ohh thank you so much
I did a reset but mmr/points still show in nicknames, is there an easy way to remove it and level roles?
you can /ratinginname toggle Disabled and then re-enable
i‚Äôll have to double check cuz resetstats should handle this
What about roles?
Should I remove them manually? Or will this break queue?
it‚Äôll recalculate them all when a game is played but you can do /autoroles refresh
working like a champ!!
i will send you some feedback about it but its been great!
sweet, i didn‚Äôt anticipate any issues but glad it‚Äôs working
can i remove earning mmr on a queue?
I created two different queue, one I want to disable. more precisely, I dont want mmr scores to show in nicknames
I changed mmr using */mmr change set* multiple times but it's not working it still stays the same any thoughts?
how can i "pull" someone from the list by first to queue?
I have the parent of the queue channels set to the Ranked category, yet the queue lobbies occasionally end up being created as uncategorized channels. Bot has administrator permissions, any thoughts on what I'm missing here
you can set the MMR change to 0
you should be able to see the change in /info ?
not too sure what you mean
common bug, will restart to temporarily fix
seems to be doubled? did you set a multiplier?
Well i changed the points manually by
/change mmr set**
If there is a multiplier how do i bring it back to normal? Maybe that could help
it would be in that same info page
hmm well you can /save the config and i‚Äôll try it
thanks!
worked fine for me, did u try with the new settings?
Yes it's continually giving double points
This
i would like for members who queue to be in an order like first through five. and say put in say command "first queue" and it would announce the name of the next member in the queue and remove them from the list. I know this isnt possible but i wanted to at least share just in case. it would be helpful to organize looking for group sessions in my community.
maybe "Up Next" for the highest on the queue
kinda a very different functionality
sounds more like a normal queue system, less about playing matches
What should i do?
so a new match with those settings gave double?
It's still giving double
All the new matches
did you by chance add a multiplier previously? maybe it‚Äôs stuck there
Well some days ago i doubled the points manually without adding a multiplier
Then we later cleared the stats and mmr stuff
And when we again started the new season it kept giving double points
i wonder if you somehow have two queues or something
try ending the queue, note the code, then end queue again
you can load the config with /load
Ah yes two queues
Fixed now ty
if you have any idea how that happened then let me know‚Ä¶
Well i think there were two queues active in the server
One was public the other was private
We were continuously fixing the private one
While we're supposed to fix the other
queues should be one per channel though
so two queues in a channel would be very unintentional
unless you ran the commands in the non queue channel?
Not in the same channel ofcourse
In different categories and different channels altogether
oh that‚Äôs weird then
perhaps you ran /link
Well sure but I don't think I'm explaining it well
You can have 2 queues in the server right?
One we have for staff which is private the other we have for public
So we mistakenly kept fixing the one that was for trial for staff
ohhhhh
okay that makes sense
no bug then, just a misunderstanding
Yes ty for your time
Hi there! what happend if the channel where the queue was, was deleted?
can you like set up mmr to roles? like roles changes depends on your mmr, like ranking system
the queue would be gone
yes with /autoroles
oh nice thanks, ooof that's gonna be tough to set up
Is the bot down?
bots down?
it recovered
What happened with the leaderboard ? Can I see that information?
Do you have a backup of that ?
stats are not deleted, they are merely tied to the queue name
if you create a new queue with the same name, the stats will be there
check ur named queue stats with /serverstats info
Great! So I have to creat a new queue from /setup and write the same name right?
Can I delete parties created by others on the server im admin/owner?
Yes, with ‚Äú/party disband‚Äù and the ‚Äúparty_name‚Äù option
Okey ty
I want bot to **-** give points to losing side, but it doesn't. Is there any way to solve this?
How in depth is the placement games functionality? I know I can customize the amount of games a player needs to play before showing on the leaderboard + the amount of placement games, but can I also make it so a player isn't given a rank(role) and can't see his stats before hes completed placement games? And are there any other placement games features other than this?
you want to give points to the loser?
the only placements feature is the multiplier
but i do like the idea of expanding to include hiding stats and/or not assigning roles until completed
yeah it'd be a nice feature
could actually adjust the stats to not show mmr
and display the placements
yeah that'd be nice
I want bot to automatically give minus points to losers. I mean I want to lower their mmr/points
if they lose
mmr and points are different
but you can do both
with /points change loss
and /mmr change set amount: loser_mmr:
I did but it didn't work
Double check with "/info" and go to page #3
Has anyone succesfully integrated league of legends stats/API into this bot?
would be against tos i believe if there is a premium for the bot
Wdym
if your bot has a paid version in it, you need to be really careful implementing riot api
It's against riot tos to have a paid option in ur bot that is using their api
because their api is free and you *could* be making money from using their api
even if the part you implement is free its not worth the risk
I'm just doing a for fun in-house server
No money involved
yea i get it
Riot can suck my nuts
also since neatqueue has mmr and stuff - thats also not allowed
true
I've ran old in-house bots which let me manually enter some info
Like champs played
Would be kinda nice
yea im sure if u did like a private one it'll be fine as long as you get an api key
but if its a public bot, bit more risky
Yeh it's a private server just me and some friends
Ready have an API key
Do you know if riot posts stats for custom games tho?
<@145305657237700608> how to change time of voting
Starting MMRs
@everyone - 0
MMR Change
20 always for wins
10 always for losses
doesnt work
<@145305657237700608> command to remove mode?
Modes are tied to a specific map, so you have to use "/map remove" and remove all the maps that have the mode you want to delete.
So basically i need to delete all maps again
And add them back again with the other modes
Yes, you need to add the same map for each mode.
It should be working, but remember MMR and Points are 2 different things; maybe you're confusing those 2?
Noo mmr doesnt change
I just want mmr to change
Might be a technical issue then, so you'll have to wait for the developer to look into it.
Meanwhile try creating a new queue and only set the MMR change per win/loss ("/mmr change set"), nothing else. Play a game, and if it works, then it means you have the wrong configuration in the other queue.
No. The only way is to use the tournament api.
What kinda of api key is it
./timer votes
what do you see then?
NeatZ check dms when you can
(20.0) -> +0.0 -> 20.0
now i get this error wtf No queue found!
If you want a queue in this channel, run /startqueue or /setup!
If you want to control a specific queue from this channel, use /link!
I'm really confused lol
are you typing this in the queue channel?
No I'm typing in the command channel but it's not working
No queue found!
If you want a queue in this channel, run `/startqueue` or `/setup`!
If you want to control a specific queue from this channel, use `/link`!
`/leaderboard` and `/stats` not working rn
it says exactly why lol
Can I run this on every channel? This happened when I created multiple queues
not too sure what you mean
when you have a queue created, you can run commands in that channel
Bot didnt create the voice channels for players for some reason, but it made the text channel. Created some hidden channels for now as a fix, not sure what caused it
Happened again
if i was to buy the subscription, would it be that one specific server or can it be with multiple servers
When will the bot work?
Bot is down?
probably
https://www.neatqueue.com/status
It's down
It's back up i think
hey guys how can i add maps to the bot after the teams have picked ?
and how can i choose that only can picked by 2 captains
would be nice if someone can help me
Hi! To add maps to the bot after the team selection, just use `/map add`
To make that only captains pick maps, use `/map voting mode: Captains`
credits and premium are in each servers dashboard
Anyone help on setting up bot for 8s ?
You mean setting up a queue for 8 players?

Use `/numberofteams` and `/teamsize` (how many players per team)
Is there a way to see MMR or Rank/Role distribution with the bot? I'd really like to see the bell curve of it
You can try `/simulate`

Also this calculator tells you how much MMR you would win/lose depending on the opponent's MMR and the variance setting: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3qtwvlrw8q
Is that just a simulation based on math or is that what the actual graph of the current MMR distribution of my server is?
Thought it was just a calculation based on math
I am not sure what's the calculation of the simulation based on. That's a good question for the developer.
The bot has access to everyone's mmr and roles, so realistically it should be able to output a graph based on that, I don't think the functionality is there for that yet, but I would love to see that added
Like this for example
All I know is that `/simulate` calculates the MMR distribution based on your queue's configuration. I don't think it takes in consideration everyone's MMR.
Yeah I used that before while setting up the bot. I *assume* its not a perfect calculation though since it shouldnt be taking into consideration exactly who is queueing and when, which would change MMR distribution. So it's probably just a good estimation, hopefully it wouldn't be too hard to display the actual distribution, guess we'll see when Neatz reads this though lol
This type of distribution specifically, nope. There's no command for that. That would be great to have tho.
that would be nice to see
but yes the simulate command just uses the current config and simulates the amount of matches
but it‚Äôs not super helpful
Yeah would be awesome to have added
It was definitely helpful when setting up the bot, but at this point since we've been using the bot for over 2 months, that command wouldnt do much for us
It should be easy to program the bot to do that. It only needs to count how many players are in each rank (role) and display it as a graph.
The `/statsbutton` already shows a player's graph.
yep won‚Äôt be hard
idk when i can do it, although if you are bored the data is available through the api
Not trying to put pressure on you tho ü§£
I would like to see it as both the MMR distribution and the Role distribution as well
yea probs added to /serverstats
The queue channels are broken again D:
wrong category?
yeah, I believe so
Hey, people in my queue can't join or leave
is anything wrong with the bot today?
its restarting
The goat does it again
So rn the bot is set at -25 for loss but players who originally have 0 points don't lose any points ( their mmr in the negative) how can i set the bot for that
Anything?
you want to remove the mmr floor?
Could you explain it a bit?
Ah yes i think so
Bot doesn't cancel despite after the vote is taken
It also does this when only one person doesn't join vc
You can change this
Go to the documents and search voice
could you elaborate
https://docs.neatqueue.com/
Use `/mmr floor`. Don‚Äôt input any number, just enter the command and it will reset back to default.
this is also happening again, btw

why bot don't work?
just wait till Neatz is online to fix the issue
<@145305657237700608>
would you know what my problem is?
bot is working for me again
Working again for me
is the bot working
For my server it is
ye i cant vote or anything

what do you see?
i vote nothing happens when i run a leaderboard cmd
channels are linked and evetyhing
wdym ‚Äúnothing‚Äù

it asks me to vote again but i cant
you probably voted while the bot was down, i‚Äôll override you
okay thanks
try now
ye ty
I got a "No queue found!" out of nowhere now in one of my queue channels
how did it disappear all of a sudden?
This server is only allowed 3 different queues. Please upgrade to premium to allow more queues!
Login at https://www.neatqueue.com/manage/1043184884212043848

But i'm pretty sure Laru paid for it, even though it's impossible for us to check with the site offline.
premium is a monthly thing, so maybe nobody paid the month?
<@145305657237700608> I was convinced I paid for it but I could be wrong, the problem is that the site is offline and therefore I can't verify or pay, our discord is currently off and these days the bot is having too many problems.
I know that what you are doing is not easy and that it is probably not your job, but since problems often derive from updates, changes and improvements that are being made to the bot, I wanted to suggest that you apply these changes only to the bot of those who are not premium, in order to understand if there are bugs, and then implement them also to those who have the premium, perhaps a week later. Unfortunately the continuous problems begin to tire our users.
there hasnt been any problem caused by an update in quite some time, i cant really remember the last time. My current issue is with scaling and infrastructure, which i need to tackle
i might be able to create a second premium-only bot, but that complicates the website since it currently talks directly to the bot
dont want to put my head where it's not needed but we could have a chat about your infrastructure and maybe I can help (i have the experience to back up what im saying dw) - let me know in dms if you'll welcome it
sure thatd be good
bot is down :C
rate limited again
this is insane
awdawiiawdi
craaazy
<@145305657237700608> is bot written in C+?
python
well
my second host got globally blocked too
so i‚Äôm kinda fucked
discord api ratelimited?
Discord is dumb :C
have you reached out to discord to get the rate limit increased?
what interactions are getting limited, do we know?
i‚Äôm not sure yet
joining the queue and admin commands
Are you saying these are *not* working and everything else is...? Sounds to me like the entire bot isn't working
yeah the entire bot isn't working I suppose
something is spamming the API, causing the entire bot to get banned by discord
I wonder if it is because of my server, Bolt Dodge
no it wouldn‚Äôt be something like that
I'm guessing you are sharded, so it can't be that. When did you ask for a rate limit increase? I know discord are pretty stingy in that area
ah alr
the bot is exceeding the 50 api request per second limit
somehow
my second host just got globally ratelimited too
the fk
or, its ignoring rate limit buckets
By second host, you mean you're running the bot on 2 different servers - since you are sharding the whole bot doesnt just live on one server right
the bot usually lives on a single server, that IP was blocked, so i swapped servers and it was also blocked immediately
the bot is sharded, but only runs as a single process
Aren't rate limits applied to the bot token, and not the ip? In my head it would be the bot token since IP can easily be changed
discord api docs say both
ip is used if bot token is not used to auth
https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits#:~:text=Rate%20limits%20exist%20across%20Discord's,bot%20token%20for%20a%20bot.
Link looks sus i know sorry
its per ip in my case
Interesting
Can i see the source link for that?
its the same one you sent
I'd personally pay money to get increase the rate limit for ya
Not how it works sadly
"if no authorization header is provided, then the limit is applied to the IP address."
Just as I started reading the paragraph yea i see it
<@135811207645888515> is your queue bot completely separate from NeatQueue
wdym
oh nvm
i see the github repo
oh i see
thought it was built on the neatqueue api
nah the api is hella impressive though
not really lmao there isnt much
You wont ever see that much work/dedication from a discord bot
espeically for someone solo
afaik ur solo anyway
struggle rn
understandable
respect
Global rate limits are for bots in 150k servers, but support is helping me determine which endpoint im exhausting
Discord support being useful?
perhaps
the bot is just running through a VPN right now lmao
so the ratelimit must be caused by some bad code spamming an endpoint or something
hopefully they can help me identify
need dem logs
yea, unfortunately my logger for the library was set to INFO, which doesnt include the exhausted bucket info
is it possible to copy auto roles config from one server to the other ?
you can /save and /load the entire config
you can load into a dummy queue in the new server, then use /autoroles copy from thered
dummy queue as in test mode?
no like /load the queue in a random temp channel
so you can use the copy command
oh I see
how does placements multipliers works? is it just x2 ?

so if default mmr change per game is 50, do I get 100 per game in placements ?
nope, its smaller
starts at 1.4x, then decreases gradually down to 1x at 10 wins
lets say I won all the 10 games, how much will I get? or does that depends on who's am playing against ?
yea it will depend on the matchups
bot down?
looks like my new IP was banned
lets grab a new one
hello, is it possible to setup 2 different team sizes or do they have to have the same number of players? for example 1v4
Is putting the premium version bot on a more separate, more stable server in the works?
no, but i think i found the issue
LETS PRAY <:Prayge:848738134786572348>
different team sizes are not supported, no
moving back to main server
nevermind
pain
you could use the player pick feature
Have you tried, turning it off and on again? And hitting it with a hammer (Experienced IT support)
i just wanna sleep <:TE_sadCat:949015713031532605>
take some rest brother
can somone help me with my queue pls?
How can i fix this? <@145305657237700608> it was okay a while ago
fix what
its the same than ashir
tahts hwos up 2 ques
you have 2 ques and you only want 1 ?
It's showing two mm messages in the same channel
I delete one but whenever someone joins it duplicates it
am not sure but you can /save copy the code, then /endqueue
if both queues ended /load and put the code
Alr ty I will try it later
usually a dupe message is just a visual bug
Well it's quite persistent
on my server there get banned
bc they cant join 2 vc xd
it's not, it starts two games at once
Yessir
any fix we can do on our side to make the queue message go to the bottom?
looks like my normal host gained connection and got unbanned, one sec
the bot is running twice
btw we got more than 1 month left of premium, but it's only allowing us 3 queues
can u show  the error?
https://i.imgur.com/zTN0UzB.png
try to /load the config
yeah it worked, but in my other channels it just says "no queue found"
should i just /startqueue with the usual name and it goes back up?
or then i would have to set it up again?
seems like you have 4 queues currently?
yeah i should have 6
i think tonight just 3 queue stayed up, while the others got stopped automatically
if they were auto stopped, it should have said the config code
but only for one of them i had the message with the config code
if its not there, then you will have to set it up again manually
with all the craziness, cant really say what else happened
if the queues are similar in their config, you can just copy them
i mean the queuename it's the same, but the elo requirements are different
what would /link do?
nothing helpful in this case
i would just /load that config code and make the other changes you need
sorry üò¢ i got nothing better
no worries i'll try
or, pass me the channel ID and ill check for the config
if it saved
1102263876566917282 and 1083057695315198012
QVEDX for the first one
UAEHG or SNZSD for the second
how can i tell the difference? xD
check ur /info
they are the same so i guess anyone is fine
should be all good now
any other way i could get those codes if this happens again without asking you?=
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/954499196629692486/1113865584183091211 this is planned
but im not gonna focus on it for a while
stability first
sure np
How can I get an API key? The documentation link seems busted @ https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=api
true https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=webhooks-generatetoken
how does multipliers streak works?
Bot down?
<#992610856904957992>
Ah yes
bot still down
One player reported he's been in the same queue since last night, while it should autokick him after 1 hour. Could you check or is there a way to do it on my own?
it might be just some leftovers from last time everything broke xd
is there a way to make the elo for different queues be the same?
(As in trying to share the same value between 2 different modes)
like, the players own MMR?
i have 2 different gamemodes in my server, but i want there to only be 1 leaderboard for both
idk if im explaining this the best üò≠
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
you need the queue names to be shared
oh okok
hey i have a question, I'm trying to set up a neatqueue in my discord channel, but the format of the games is going to be like a 3 round swiss tournament
i've only used neatqueue in other channels where it's a singular game
is there a way to manage the mmr like this or is this not functionality that's coded
there is a tournament feature, but it‚Äôs very basic and poorly tested
is this something that you guys are interested in actively developing? I can try to help you test it. If that's not where your priorities are i understand
what exactly would be needed?
i guess just the swiss style
yeah so basically i have a tcg discord server
and i want to host drafts or maybe other tournaments on there in the future
and all of the tournament structures would be swiss or round robin probably
tbh the rating tracking is honestly not that important
but i was just curious cuz it seemed cool
which command to clear the leaderboard?
hi may i ask why the message doesnt show again
bot keeps going on then off
<@145305657237700608>
<@145305657237700608>  is it possible for the <#992610856904957992> to automatically push out the messages to servers following the channel?
Follow the channel
I did, but it doesn‚Äôt auto push for me for some reason, not sure if that‚Äôs an issue on my end then?
i have to investigate what is causing the outage every day
i suspect it‚Äôs the backup being taken
<@145305657237700608> how do you reset everryone's record on the leaderboard (as in W/L)
you can use /resetstats
or just use /set and manually change the wins and losses
resetstats will wipe everything
i did that
'/resetstats'
it only reset mmr
the bot isn't moving people to the voice channels when games are started/ended
restarting
this command would wipe all the stats
is there a way for neatqueue to include only members of the active queue in the temporary text channel? Because right now it includes everyone within the role I have set. Since it includes everyone within the role, does that mean even people outside this queue can vote?
that would be the normal behavior, and also no, only people in the match can vote
thank you! appreciate it!
is there a way to see all commands that made with the bot (log or something)
<@145305657237700608> maybe?
All available commands?
Or all commands that people are using in the server
staff commands like /mmr set or something
that i can see which staff is using a command he shouldnt
map add not working?
bot seems to be working fine however, there is a game going right now with no issues
working now
I keep on logging in on the website, it takes me to the discord login page, I login, and then it sends me back to the page  I was at first and it says I still need to login....reoccuring loop
It won't let me access the dashboard
let me check it out
Thanks!
Any updates?
<@145305657237700608> its still doing it, do you want me to screen share to show you what I am talking about
How do I configure the bot to create a private mix and send the lobby password to the players private?
something like this:
i‚Äôm not home to look at it yet
you can use the /lobbydetails command
okay, no worries
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobby-details
how do i configure for start a mix with only one goalkeeper? we are playing pro soccer online with your bot and we want to start the mixs with only one goalkeeper
but there's no way to do that
<@145305657237700608>
you can forcestart with only 9 people
but the goalkeeper will still be on a team
resolved
thank you!!!
thanks, one more question, Is there a way to leave the mode for only captains to choose directly?
if you want always captain selection, you can use /teamselection
thank you my bro, you're the best! goat
Any known issue of settings not saving? for example, sometimes the bot will stop dragging people automatically to queue vc and to the teams after created
i'll have to manually set up the settings agin
its not a setting issue, its just a bug that exists
randomly occurs, i cant find the issue still üòÑ
sounds good, would be nice to fix because people keep complaining about getting banned when the settings don't save
people are saying they getting banned even if they're in the Queue VC and someone doesn't join, causing a cancel
yea its all related issues
restarting the bot fixes it, which is a very bad solution
i would disable auto bans for now
got it
any solution to people not getting autodragged?
Is it possible to count kd or something <@145305657237700608>
And get like points for it
Is there a way to make a role that is able to spectate in the vcs?
<@145305657237700608>
`/spectatorrole`
no, the bot only takes in wins/losses
Is there a way to configure it so that only team captains vote on the winner of the match?
not currently
<@145305657237700608> any way to expand on this: 

__**Misc**__
`/misc shuffleonstart` Toggle shuffling the players upon match start. This will only have an impact when a match is attempted to be started with more players than needed. The default behavior is to take the first X players who joined the queue, but using this command will make it randomly select players instead.

The use case of this is when hosting an event where people will all join the queue in an attempt to get put into the game (maybe to play in a streamers match). All the players queue up, an admin `/forcestart`s the match, and players are randomly selected from the queue.

The only way to have a match start with more people that required is if the `/misc startwhen` command is set to `Forcestarted`
Think it would be awesome to be able to give certain discord roles increased odds of being selected.

Example:
VIP - 1.5x odds
Tier 3 sub - 2.0x odds

Etc. I don‚Äôt know how hard it would be to implement but think it would be great
yea, currently you can add priority to roles, but its not exactly what you are looking for
its not increased odds, its guaranteed priority
Gotcha, I was kinda hoping it was sort of like a giveaway, those with higher roles just had a few extra chances
ill have to think of a way to modify the command for that
Okay cool, thank you for the quick response, I currently run my own system all on stream but looking to switch over to discord, and that was a big thing, people love to be able to have a way to increase their odds to play without it fully being pay to play
should be easy to build off the current system
currently someone with priority 5 always gets in the game over someone without priority (priority 0), but it can be changed so its like 6 tickets in the giveaway vs 1
Awesome. 

One last question: I have my current mmr / xp system setup so it keeps things interesting and it‚Äôs not always the BEST players at the top. Just so it‚Äôs constantly switching and doesn‚Äôt become stagnant.

My setup is:
0-500 MMR for a win * Streak.
So if you got 100 XP and you were on a 3 streak you would get 300 XP.

On a loss it‚Äôs anywhere from -1% to -25% of your overall XP.

Is there any settings you could recommend that have quite a bit of variance ? People love it because on a win they can‚Äôt wait to see how much XP they got but sometimes can‚Äôt e believe they only got 1 XP while other times they are pumped because they got 500 while on a 5 streak.
im not totally understanding
there isnt a way to do any "random" changes to a players' MMR since its all skill based really
you can customize the win/loss base amounts though
I gotcha! No worries, I know my system is a little wacky. Was basically just wondering if there is any way at all to set random variance to mmr after winning and losing.

Say team 1 lost:
Player 1 may lose 2% of MMR
Player 2 may lose 5% of MMR
Player 3 may lose 3% of MMR
Player 4 may lose 20% of MME

While I know this isn‚Äôt ideal as a default setting, having a little bit of luck involved gives more people a feeling at a chance at top of leaderboard and a chance to catch someone above them even though they may get put on same team together a lot
And as for winning with your current system I see you have a streak multiplier. How does that work is it default mmr * streak or no
yea, currently there is nothing random about the MMR system
(Basically just trying to turn the skill based MMR system, into skill based with a little luck)

You move up leaderboards quickly by winning going on streaks, when you lose sometime you lose alot sometimes you lose a little
streaks are pretty minor, 2 wins gives you a 1.04x multiplier, 3 wins is 1.08x, 4 wins is 1.12x, etc
Gotcha, no worries!
but i can have the giveaway type system available for later/tomorrow
Awesome thank you! 
I‚Äôm sure the try hards in my stream will like the 100% skill based, but the randomness helped the less skilled feel like they have a shot some weeks haha
Heck maybe just a wins leaderboard will do the trick rather than a MMR for what I‚Äôm tryin to accomplish
Appreciate you workin on the giveaway thing tho man. Thank you!!
there is a wins leaderboard available in /leaderboard and the website
yeah thats what I was saying, I could just use that instead of focusing on the MMR so much
<@145305657237700608> how do I change the starting mmr
if I alreadt made one
or how so I delete one of my setups and restart
you can use /startingmmr
<@145305657237700608> Any chance to add
1-1-1-2
Drafting option?
Captain 1: Picks
Captain 2: Picks
Captain 1 Picks:
Captain 2: gets picks 6 & 7.
Captain 1 gets last pick.

This prevents captain 1 from getting first pick and not stuck with the overall last pick in lobby.
<@145305657237700608> how do I make my queues have different leaderboards
like I want my 1s, 2s, and 3s with seperate leaderboards
like completely seperate MMR ratings, like I don't want them to effect each other (wins or losses)
ill check it out
name the queues different
i did
one is 1s
the other is 2s
and the other is 3s
names are solos, duos, and trios
yea thats all you need, the stats wont be shared
<@145305657237700608> The MMR is binding between the different queues
is there any way I can like screen share to show you what I am talking about?
nvrm I think i figured it out, sorry to bother xD
I've looked through the documentation twice and either missed it or am unaware of it's proper name. 
Is there a command to have NeatQueue no longer require players to join VC lobby for the voting to start? 
We plan on creating evens with 64 players and up, having that many join a single VC is impossible, especially in teams of 8 where they plan on sticking inside their Discord server. 
Any help is much appreciated; thank you in advance.
you can modify the /voicechannels mode
<@145305657237700608> How could I remove the prioritized role for captains ? Like how to counter /captains role
Please üôè
just do `/captains role`
without any options
Thank you
any way to set a certain role as the captain all the time instead of people voting for them, like a role they pick in the queue not a discord role.
any idea how to get the bot to not creat 2 seperate tables after the qeueu is filled? im trying to use the bot for a webcam based card game
<@145305657237700608>
How to make the queue have the role name and not ID of the role?
<@145305657237700608>
only way is a discord role, not any special queue role
you could try using the `/reactionroles` for it
tables?
where ?
Sorry I meant voice calls
I only need it to create 1 VC that both players would meet in to use their webcams to play the Digimon Card Game together
Like I understand the bot makes 2 because 2 separate teams and this is usually used along side another physical online game but we do everything in house so I only need the bot to create 1 VC
hmm currently no, its either 1 vc per team, or none at all
how do i make it create none? id be fine having them go to a premade table
`/voicechannels mode`
Go to <#915810764277817354> and <#915812742865231912>, then you will know what I mean.
im not sure what you are looking for
In the <#915810764277817354>, it says ‚Äú**Queue 0/6**‚Äù, while for me it doesn‚Äôt say it unless I‚Äôm doing wrong.

Then, in <#915812742865231912>, it says ‚Äú**Team 0/4**‚Äù with its list of roles in English while mine does that but the roles shows up as ‚Äú**@<153839372423739>**‚Äù instead.
when you do /roles, dont add a discord role mention, just type the name of it
its unrelated to discord roles
Ok let me try it.
Can I show a screenshot of what happened?
sure
I tried typing it in words and not in roles, and that happened.
I used ‚Äú**/roles**‚Äù for this.
Ok, no need, I got it correctly. <@145305657237700608>
Thanks for the help anyway!
So now, my next question is ‚Äú**how do you delete a created queue?**‚Äù
you can /endqueue
if you mean a match, you can /outcome cancel or /cancel
<@145305657237700608> thank you for running this bot so smoothly lately, i been getting no complaints from people in 6mans about the bot lately<3
can someone help me setup neatqueue for valorant. how to I make sure it links peoples accounts so that it detects when they game is over and move their MMR up on the discord server?
<@145305657237700608>
i dont think something this integrated is possible... has anyone actually done this?
hey, is it possible to skip teamselection in a queue ? it is a duel queue
would be cool, but yea not currently possible
yup just change the /teamselection to Balanced
üôÇ i‚Äôve got some big changes coming to the system as well that will help me scale much better
got few questions please

1- what happens when category is full of 50 channels, can i assign a 2nd or 3rd category so new queue text channels go there ? i know there is already a command but is there auto switch to next category command ?

2- can the bot edit result in GameResult channel AFTER staff change result outcome?
3- is there a way to display more than 1 leaderboard in a channel which all auto update after results?
currently when the category is full, new channels just spill out of the category
would be good to add a way to specy backups
the match result sent to the main channel wont be updated after a result was picked
you can use /leaderboard and specify the queue name
thanks
it seems when i choose queue name for leaderboard, i cannot see 2v2 queue, and if i enter name manually bot replies no queue found
i confirmed that 2v2 queue exists and /leaderboard works in that queue channel
also when i select queue name from provided list in a non-queue channel -> reply no queue found
so i guess i must link the queue ? anyway i did link several queues to a single channel so i post multiple leaderboards but when i refresh any leaderboard -> it is converted to the last linked queue leaderboard

anyways it's not a big issue for me, now i have my leaderboards in queue channels but i just want to report
ill have to test it out yea, havent tried this before
it wont show a queue_name if no players have any data
yo <@145305657237700608> could you possibly show me how to get it setup to where the MMR is based on the valorant accounts not the base 1k? I am setting up a new 10s server that people can get in queues with people their own MMR in.
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/868549627652214794/1118883153201877023
Riot would send a cease and desist so fast
im running into an issue where the chat channel that the bot creates after the queue is filled doesnt give users permissions to chat in it. Do I have to generate a role for them on discord or something?
i have given the bot administrator priviliges
you can use `/requireregister` to have players use `/register`, which will pull their initial MMR from their valorant account
do you have any category overrides or something that block the users?
i do have permissions set by category but in the category that the channel is being created everyone has permission to view and such
in addition some of the people who queue up arent able to view the created channel
is there a best practices way to manage permissions? I want to have a section or rather the majority of the channels private, but a selection of channels public
created channels will inherit the permissions of the category, but then add on new perms to give players access to what they need
so strange it should inherit the permission for the category that the queue channel is in no?
well, whatever category it is creating the new channels in
the category does give view and write permissions, but I think I will have to rearrange the default permissions for the server
because I have the default permissions for the server to disallow users to see the channels, I think that it might be inheriting from that and not from the category
i believe that would override any category perms
Hey, so this is my first time setting up this bot. 
I put it 5 players per team and 2 teams, so it should be 10 players in total.
So for the picking order it should be 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1 
Is this possible with NeatQueue?
Am i missing something? 
Thank you in advance üòÑ
that type of picking order isnt supported :/
sad, but ty for the answer üëç
Am I able to copy my queue settings/ maps onto a new queue or would I need to redo everything
you can use `/save` and `/load` for moving queue configs
how do i do map voting? ive used all the commands that have map in the name and added all maps to the map pool but unsure how to actually start the voting on it
if you have maps added, map voting would happen right after teams are picked
oh ok,, i guess when i was testing it just with myself it was weird since it was only me
thank you!
Hi I‚Äôm tryna make it so after queue it automatically goes to voting captains but it keeps having us pick what we want to do.
What is the command so it will have us vote captains as soon as enough are in queue?
<@145305657237700608> how does the /numberoflobbies command work, what does it do?
Neat, do you ever get in voice channels for live support? Would be super helpful ü•π
i enabled /anonymousqueue in a 2v2 queue but i can still see the party team name joined, so it is not 100% anonymous. is there a fix for this ?
oh lol, that‚Äôs a bug for sure
change ur /teamselection to Captains
if you set it to 2 lobbies, it will create two different matches
sure i do, i‚Äôm not around this weekend but during the week i can
<@145305657237700608> Awesome it worked! Last question it wont drag us to the que channel how do I fix that?
you can use /lobbychannel pullall to auto drag to the Queue#123 channel
Broo thanks
Whats the command for the bot to give out a role after mmr reaches a certain level? <@145305657237700608> ?
/autoroles mmr
Ok so what if 20 people queue into match making at once and only have 1 lobby
how big is each match?
it‚Äôll create 10 matches
it‚Äôs kinda useless for matchmaking queue type
Ok perfect, I thought so,  just wanted to make sure
for a normal queue, it would only start when all 20 people queue, but then create 10 matches all at once
is it possible to disable queue message sticking to the bottom of the chat? I only see this option for winner message
no actually
but once it moves up, it‚Äôll just be gone
what do you mean by moves up?
when I type a message the queue jumps under my message
like if you were able to disable it
I have the queue channel locked anyway, so people can't type - but I wanted to set it up so I can type some stuff under the queue
I think that should be an option if possible
<@857633321064595466> <@267303709011214337> is there a way to give top 3 xp in ffa queue?
That command does not exist!
anyone knows how to see bot name configuration?
which command to increase the ban time for those who do not enter the call? Please
it‚Äôs /player autoban
you can give them a special top 3 role with /autoroles top players
then use /add mmr
all the name configuration
does it work if i just use their username?
codes are from doing /save
you would have to do it manually
either per user, or per role
well for autoroles, it‚Äôs all automatic
and what if I want too see all the previous codes?
there‚Äôs a feature request for that currently
Hey <@145305657237700608>, **/Outcome SelectWinner** doesnt work with FFA as it asks for **match num** *(which is okay)* and **team num** (which there are none of for me because players dont get split into team channels, which means they are not assigned team numbers). It would be a nice fix if "player name" [or smthing like that] was added. So "player name" and "team num" were both optional but you had to enter one or the other, so admins can enter a single winner instead of team.

Im not sure if there is a way that this command would check to see if the queue was teams or ffa so that it could give an error prompt when entering a single winner in a team queue.

The solution im looking for is a FFA queue where not everyone has voted the winner, to manually select the one(1) FFA winner
they still have team numbers, but yea i guess not visible
maybe i was mistaken, that queue was Full Team vs Full Team type, maybe anonymous is not suppose to work for this type ?
i just tried a matchmaking type queue and teams are hidden when anonymous is enabled
anonymous should work in any type
does **/mmr change hidden** hide the changes shown in the post game match details or is it hiding the changes done manually by admin with **/add mmr** ?
is it possible to disable Hero Ban voting timer so players can vote whenever they can and when voting is finished -> bot posts match details immediatly instead of waiting vote timer to finish?
i‚Äôm not totally following, the bot should post the match details after the vote
can i disable timer for Hero ban voting timer ?
i tried to set 0 but it is instantly over and no time to vote
you can extend timers, but you can‚Äôt make them infinite
Is there a way to link the bot's MMR with that of a game, specifically Rocket League?
you can initialize a players‚Äô MMR with their rocketleague account using /requireregister
Which playlist does it take for the MMR, if you don't mind me asking?
it‚Äôs just the highest one
And the bot keeps track of MMR on it's own, adding to the winners and subtracting from the loosers?
through its own MMR system yes, it will be completely detached from rocketleague after the initial rating
Thank you! Any features you suggest I take a deeper look at?
bot has permissions in the channel?
no it does not
it‚Äôs an error straight from discord, so someone else must‚Äôve changed
can you view other people's created parties?
yes via /party view
Hey Neatz is there a way to change the bot logo? <@145305657237700608>
no :/
There is no way because you don't own the bot.
only owners of the bot can edit the custom commands and other shinanigans of the bot, while the non-owners of the bot can only play around with its commands.
yep, best you can customize the Nickname and the queue embeds
hi, I'm contacting you cause I'm interested in using the neatqueue bot (paying for it long term) for a community discord, I started experimenting on a test server just to see what it looked like in action, I then added it to the main server a few weeks later before realising there was a trial timer that was linked on a per account basis, I'm now stuck with almost no trial left on the actual server I wanna test it on (my mistake) I'm wondering if there would be a way you could generously reset the trial for a specific server, or even my account so I could actually test the bot with my final user in real conditions and decide with the other admins if the bot is well received by our community and if we wanna pay for it, you can DM me if you wanna answer there, thanks by advance !
there aren't any trial timers, maybe you meant premium? Reach out in my DMs please
I'm coming back from work and will dm you in 15/20 mins if that's fine for you !
dm sent <:wigglyTuff:1067893867216637952>
guys, do you have problems adding more than 25 heroes? bot seems to bug out for me after around 25
the behaviour im experiencing is that it takes too long to load, so team 1, and sometimes team 2 wont be able to do their first ban and it bans something randomly.. it'll sometimes behave when it has gone long enough time for 2nd bans
sometimes it just bugs out totally
ill have to check it out, most votes don't allow more than 25 options, but for heroes i worked on a separate way to make it work, but its not used often
yeah my game has like 28 heroes, for now i just removed 2-3 rarely banned champs
ill gladly try out your workaround
if you could /save the config and post the code for me, would appreciate it
MJUNQ
what bugs out for you?
as i said, captain 1 will rarely ever be able to load until its gone past 2nd or 3rd ban
reproducable
happened in like 3 games in a row and i just had to remove 3 of them
i'll have to afk for a bit now tho, see if you can reproduce it?
and yeah everyone in the lobby sees its not loading properly
the buttons
i can try to make it bug out and send you that config later
there wont be any buttons
since there is a max of 25 buttons possible
Captains can vote by sending a message with their pick
(I should make this much clearer)
again this is barely used, so would appreciate user input
what the message? makes sense, since buttons disseapear when pick is gone after 25 ones they start appearing
also, my people are saying MVP is bugged? for some reason doesn't always go to the right person
this is the 3rd day they have been complaining about it
whats the match number, ill check
Queue#325355 üèÜ
yea something is for sure messed up
thanks for the help
hi, when i try to load a config, neat sends me this message: This server is only allowed 3 different queues. Please upgrade to premium to allow more queues!
Login at https://www.neatqueue.com/manage/1097359139824488458
Hi where can i find what I get for going premium and the price
Can you run more than 1 queue without premium?
when you login to the dashboard and select a server, you will be able to see
the free tier gives 3 different queue channels, max 50 games a day
Can I run different team sizes on them different queues?
New user to the bot (yesterday) so yesterday went well getting 1 queue set up no issues at all
yep totally different setup
<@145305657237700608> is they're any way to prevent people from getting re-matched with won another,  we had 8 people playing last night but for some reason 2 people kept getting re-paired with one another leading to one player farming the other to get to the top of our ladder currently
no not really
im trying to add this to my discord community so they can play call of duty 8s, how do i get this setup?
`/setup`
Hi for some reason the 10s  bot doesn‚Äôt go to recent message after someone sends a msg, it suddenly stopped working and it‚Äôs like frozen at when it was last posted
Any ideas on how to fix that?
The queue post^
<@145305657237700608>
should be fixed
not your fault
Okay, I now have 2 queues set up; does leaderboard show all stats over both queues?
I‚Äôve tired, I‚Äôm a novice and can‚Äôt work it out
if they have the same name
how i can change the vote system?
I changed names, but I can't get/leaderboard to pull any into a channel where there is no queue
I'd like the leaderboard channel to show both, but the command doesnt recongise a queue. This wasn't an issue until i made the 2nd queue
yea, when you have 1 queue, the bot will allow you to use queue commands in any channel for convenience. When you have 2 queues, it no longer can do that since it doesn't know which to use. You can manually specify the queue you want via `/link {queue channel}`
Does linking allow to show 2 queue leaderboards in one channel?
you can only link to a single queue
but if they have the same queue name, the leaderboard will be shared
Okay cool, since my queue chanels are only viewable to begin with I will just host leaderboards at top of that channel above queue button
will probably work best
How can I set the Elo to be visible after the name?
<@145305657237700608> i have a privat question can i dm you?
`/ratinginname`
And how i can change the vote system?
the required number?
wdym
like what do u mean change the vote system
I mean it like this.. that, for example, you vote for a person in the queue who chooses his team
so 2 captains who vote
oh, /teamselection
is there a way to remove kicking for inactivity? We like to plan who is in our party a couple hours beforehand and it instantly created a voice and text channel for us. When one of us didn't join the call right away, it kicked them from the queue for inactivity.
auto queue reset: `/timer queuereset`
auto player kick: `/timer afk`
voice chat lobby timer: `/lobbychannel timer`
Hi, people didnt vote for the queue to finish, how do I end the game to pick either Defender or Attacker Win, (Val Queue)
/outcome
thank you!
How i can Start a test queue?
/ test
and how i can start the test q
/setup or /startqueue
how to check total amount of games in channel? im a bit confused of /serverstats channelnames games (channel) (format), what does rename mean? renames the queue? i just want to see total amount of games
it will name a channel, similar to <#966580351575142480>
you cant check per queue game counts
oh ok ty
how to make it beautiful like yours?
voice channel?
that‚Äôs the default format iirc
Sometimes the performance of the bot can be a little lackluster (takes time to respond, sometimes times out). Is it possible to self-host an instance of the bot (closed sourced compiled binary with our own given token) on our own hardware?
i would like to know if the "random" choice actually still balances the teams based on mmr, or is that only in the "balanced" option because balanced doesnt allow reshuffling i dont think
Cant get captains doing bans hero bans simultaneously to work..  üò¶
its always turn based
any way to have each player veto one map each or ban 1 hero each simultanously?
how to change bot language?
<@145305657237700608>
sorry can‚Äôt do that, i‚Äôm close to splitting the bot across multiple machines though
random does not balance by mmr at all
you can change the /map voting
and /hero voting
/language
But doesn't work...
Tested for like 3 games yesterday, always goes team by team for me.... Map voting works, i guess can't do simultaneous map bans?
for bans change the /map bans setting
i see, is there an option to reshuffle teams with balanced? because sometimes it doesn't always get it perfect
i would be surprised if the balancing wasn't exactly perfect 98% of the time tbh
the community im in is very small
so the balancing is in terms of NeatQueue MMR
i figured that much, its more that just if not all of us agree with the teams we have to redo the que process rather than reshuffling, a reshuffle option on balanced would be nice
Liam I think in that case if there's a player who's MMR doesn't reflect their skill level that should be manually adjusted, dunno if that's possible tho
obviously, but again, tfc is a random game, or circumstances outside of the game can affect things etc
i definitely wouldn't want to add a reshuffle to Balanced, since there wouldnt be any other way to set up the teams
you might want to use a different team selection mode if the MMR doesn't reflect player skills well enough yet
a different team select mode wouldnt be accurate, other than captains selection which we have already been doing without the bot
Yeah tbh liam knowing tfc as little as I do, do captains through the bot for a couple weeks for it to get an idea of mmr and then let balanced take over
With Random selection, you can easily reshuffle the teams
the bot will ask if the teams are fair
we dont need the bot to captains select, only benefit there would be either a map vote or the mmr stuff, the random vote would be good if i had the option for MMR balancing with it
hmmm, another thing, with an added vote menu, is there a way to display 3 random options rather than a whole list at once
Liam, random with balancing IS balanced. You're basically asking for the bot to have the same issue as the purgery
even captains voting mmr wouldn't balance the individual players, it'd be better setting them manually, also im trying to mimic the former pugbot, which worked fine, the random does not balance on mmr, it only asks if you like the teams, which if you select no it then repeats to make another random unbalanced team
thats how NeatQueue works as well
but overall Captain selection is usually pretty fair
Hey is there a way to change a setup channel? I set it up in the wrong one XD
you can /save the config and then /load using the code
so after i manually set elos it didn't save
set it twice too
Thanks mate, as I ran out of my 3 free queues, so I just stopped the queue in the wrong channel and started it in the correct one
Also I've read through the doc but couldn't see if we all start on the same mmr or do I need to set mmrs ? Or tell the players to register account ?
Apologies for the questions haha
Oh 1 more ü§£, can anyone q up? Like if a gc starts the q can a diamond join?
by default everyone starts at 1000, you can change it with /startingmmr, or require people to register via /requireregister and /register
by default, yes
Amazing, thanks for the info and quick response üëç
I got the 50 games limit, the 24 hrs that i have to wait starts when i reached the limit or any timezone?
Game limit?
it‚Äôs at noon EST
when the bot posts in <#935731235790139422>
Thankyu
I've got an issue where we just sit here? It doesn't create any vcs or anything, assuming I've done something wrong but no idea what, it's setup as a 1v1 channel
could you kick the bot and reinvite
I cancelled the q and managed to fix it just now mate üëç
When I change neatqueue to team captains, is it possible to make it where the 2-highest players in the queue are team captains? (Afraid to mess with the settings I have right now, can‚Äôt check)
yup /captains selection
you can always save your config with /save
to create a backup
Perfect, thank you! And also for that other helpful tip
whats the command to move the bot to a seperate channel?
i need to move it to a seperate channel for a moment
how to remove a banned player from the table? <@145305657237700608>
like move the queue?
set @ everyone as a /requiredrole
its fine dont worry we sorted it
is there a way to set required mvp votes lower?
also for some reason our leaderboard is just not working
all votes have the same requirement
what do you see?
oh true, so the vote for the winning team is the same as the mvp? but you can optionally have the mvp be required or not?
ill show you the leaderboard by the way one second
exactly
yeah cool, good to know thats how it works now üôÇ
ill get you the leaderboard issue then i have 1 more question for now
the leaderboard just started working, my guess is because we finally got 10 players to use the bot to make a leaderboard etc
so my other and hopefully final issue i am having is the winning/results post is not showing elo loss/gain and not showing an mvp or granting the mvp bonus, i have mvp enabled and the winning format set to detailed
so im not sure what the issue is
oh also i do have mmr changes set to show
Would it be possible to use this bot to sort out teams of 5 players for boss runs on a mmo/rpg. Giving the 5 players a temp role and then removing the roles after the boss run is completed?
is it just showing winners or loser?
i think so
set the /numberofteams to 1
and set an /autoroles ingame
willl talk to you soon  i nee sleep
yeah basically just showing the winning and losing team players with no mvp and no elo gain and loss on the results
it is showing this when i want it to be showing an mvp and show the elo loss and gain on the players
also streaks aren't working for us either
possible to make the bot skip over hero picks for a single game by voting? i want to add custom vote menu for bans or not/or using a custom hero draft tool we have ... i mean could let the timers run out but
basically feature to skip over a certain vote menu
whats your config /save
MVP wont show since nobody got enough votes
but also, wouldnt show in that view anyways
it seems to have fixed itself
does mvp even work?
after captains are picked instead of moving us into the channels it disconnects everyone
when ever i vote for the bot it still wont let me use stats after ive voted
Can Anyone Help Or is It A Bug <@145305657237700608> Sorry For The Ping
clearly some issues with the changes today lmao
yeah i got no clue
i voted it on 2 accs my alnt and main and it still didnt work
try checking stats now?
it works ty
all of the text channels being created today are numbered 102
is that a known bug
it should increment every match ?
i can see all of the queue channels that are being created i just noticed all of the ones today are queue-102
it's not a huge deal because it's not visible to everyone else but i was just curious if you were aware of this type of behavior
and those matches actually got started?
yeah
well i don't know if i had set it up properly, at least it has been working thus far i only noticed this today
right now the only thing that i use the bot in my channel for is creating the games
there's no prompt to declare winners or losers or whatever from the bot in this channel
it's more to assemble the people together in that channel so that they can run the event with everyone together
hmm yea seems like now it wouldnt see that match number as used
ill fix it for that time of queue
type*
i need help gang
mf got banned for 10 years
how i unban them?
/player unban
that‚Äôs the default duration for /player ban
thanks b
can someone help me set up a queue for my server?
its minecraft football which is cringe
but i need help
have you tried /setup
yeah but there some things i wanna fix or change
idk how to make different things you can queue up as in one queue
like different things to queue up as
`/roles`
ill try it
it worked
now how do i make it so I can have 2 of one and 4 of another role?
it a 3v3 thing
`/roles roles:X,Y,Y`
damn
thanks
now how do make it so the teams are picks in the temps vcs?
cause its telling me i have to make a party to queue
likes 2 team sides
and tells me to make a party
change the /queuetype to PUGs
nice
i think thats everything
Im having this problem
Is there anyone with this bug too?
When im gonna vote it says match not found
if you queue up to more than 1 queue at once, when your queue is ready are you taken out of the other queues?
I think u can‚Äôt queue more than 1
it will remove you from other queues when a match starts, yes
that is strange
any other error pop up?
After some seconds the message disappears, only buttons team 1 and team 2 left, happened twice
whats ur config /save
This is the code: CXDOW
which server?
Hey how do I fix priority queue on my server?
This is the Id of the server: 888915746825064518 called la agustin army
whats broken about it ?
So when a queue gets cancelled because someone didn't show players get automatically requeued but some people don't and it's weird
oh, im aware of this
about to push out a fix
few minutes
all good
i have a problem right now when we join queue and bot would make match for us but it's like nothing happen
Does the bot have perms?
and normally when we click to vote for finish our match
these voice chat won't gone as well
so whats happening?
we can't join queue right now
why?
idk how do i explain but
just join and nothing happen
but if i click leave queue the bot replies me
as normally
what should i do?
im not seeing any issues on my side
its the same for everyone?
can you /player add?
i tried for one time
hmm yea something happened
the bot processes joins 1 at a time, somehow one got stuck and blocked the queue
and we got blocked or stuck queue for 3 queues
is there any new config you set up recently?
I don't remember but i just saved
config: FFWJI
Is the bot working fine? Forcestart's not creating the usual channels
something seems to be up
is there possible? if I endqueue and remake queue again without reset points on leaderboard
one sec
it seems to be fixed?
hopefully
is there a way to make the queue be balanced by default rather than going to a vote for it?
change the /teamselection
someone bought bots for me but no credits even though money was withdrawn
not sure if you guys do this but I'm setting up the bot in my server right now and I'm hoping to just get some guidance in a voice chat on setup? I'd like to use the bot to create multiple queues (2v2, 3v3, etc) across multiple games, and I think it's going to be pretty complex and I bet some experienced help will help me do this in the most efficient way possible.
to create shared stats across multiple queues, just name the queues the same
otherwise, /setup will give you the most useful config
Do I need to make a different channel for each mode?
oh cool, lmk when its out
it is
sure
thank you!
hello good afternoon, I would like to know if the bot is capable of pairing the games depending on the mmr, what I mean is that when selecting teams the players do not have the option to choose how the teams are going to be distributed, for example captains or pick etc... on the contrary, do it automatically by mmr
yes, you can change your /teamselection
for MMR based, use Balanced
thanks
So, I was testing, and had just two of us, to see how the workflow goes.
It made a channel, and we picked ourselves as captains, but then it got stuck, I guess I should have set it as a minimum of 4 instead of 2, as I tried to end it and it said teams hadn't been picked yet.
shouldn‚Äôt get stuck in that case
I try to use the command /stats or leaderboard tells me that I have to vote register to vote but the function is not activated
does anyone know how to add a queue message?
like when someone joins the queue a certain role will be pinged
try now
you can‚Äôt really add a custom message like that
you can use /autoping to ping a role though
ty ty
last question. how do i change the amount of mmr you gain/lose per queue
/mmr change
the spanish language doesnt work at all yet?
it just translates some parts
could you give an example
i already set the language to spanish
it works here
but here it doesnt
I saved a config and I'd like to duplicate it but just change the player count and roles (tank). Which commands do this?
I've already loaded it on a new channel
u load it, then u change it manually i think
yes. I need the commands that allow me to do that
/save and /load
I have already saved and loaded
hmm i‚Äôm not sure where those translations went
i‚Äôll double check
I have also changed the name of the queue, I now just need to change the player count, going from 8v8 to 7v7, and then roles, to remove a role to accomodate for one less player on each
thanks dude
change the /roles
will that change player count?
like the queue size?
8v8 to 7v7
if your queue is role based then yes
it will resize
worked, thanks
Also, idk if the bot is laggy but the votes for example of choosing captains arent showing up
or if its just not showing up the votes but is actually working
what‚Äôs ur config?
CXDOW
but i did a small change so its now: BIQYQ
oh the vote for captains?
yea it‚Äôs not registering votes i guess?
yea is not
like its working, but it doesnt show the votes
weird
or idk if its random choosing
another thing to look at ig
Did you develop the bot on your own?
respects man
yea just me
things been crazy the past day with the bot infrastructure changes
i sometimes dont want to send the issues bc i see that you have to attend a lot of things
that stuff shouldn‚Äôt be related though
I just bought $50 worth of credits on the website but they're not on the account
nah i‚Äôd rather be aware of it
<#919709100114346076>
i‚Äôll manually fix them in a few
did the problems started with the server thing?
some of them
so I cant get premium until its fixed?
hope u can solve them man, cya and good luck
i think he can gives u manually, but yeah
Well I either need it manually or I need my $50 back
hes fixing it dw
whatever you want lol
i can give it now
premium please
should be good
not yet
got it
epic
<@145305657237700608> did u actually solve the problem of the winning votes that i talked u abt? if not, i ended the queu and started again and now its working üëç  so yay
no i didn‚Äôt do anything
one worked thanks
weve been having this problem where we cant view stats with /stats. It gives us a message saying we need to vote to unlock it. However, multiple meembers have voted and we still cannot view stats. Is thre a way to fix this?
<#919709100114346076>
i‚Äôve manually fixed it for your server though
hello, is there anyway to move a votingmenu to before the teams are made or before the captains start picking
is there also a way to adjust the captains pick order? i see there is some options there but i would like to have my own order
The captains pick order u can change it by /captains drafttype and then it‚Äôll show u the options of drafttype
yeah but i was looking to make my own custom order, not the pre options
its fine though i think we're happy with the hybrid option
no  its all after team selection
and yea cant do a custom captain order, only predefined ones
shame, cheers anyway
bot down?
ohh restarting nvm i just saw it
myyyyy bad
this is mostly fixed
the translations are now there ... but it auto translated to include both forms of each word...
ill fix it later
niceee and thanks
That is amazing üëè
Also do you remember the votes not showing up?, i changed the language back to english and they show up, but in spanish it doesnt, so it could be something wrong with the language that its really a strange error
Can the bot be configured to turn off at a certain time?
i do, thats a strange find, but ill check it out
you can use /lock and specify a time + timezone
What happens if the bot is turned off while a game is in progress, does the score of that game count?
the bot isnt turning off, its just locking your queue from being used
Yes, but in case there is a game at that moment, and the bot turns off, will it count the points of said game?
It just locks people from queue, it doesn‚Äôt cancel the game or anything
I mean
If there‚Äôs a game and the bot locks, for example u can‚Äôt queue bc it‚Äôs locked, it won‚Äôt affect results if there‚Äôs a game running
exactly right
i think he means if the bot literally turns off/crashes as a whole
or a restart
nah he meant for locking the bot for a certain time
if they meant if the bot turns off, that wouldnt be good
but the bot makes sure to not turn off when a match is in setup
what if its unavoidable? like rate limit stuff
then i get very sad
<:Smadge:884249757973893140>
if its unplanned, then yea the match setup is lost
if you can see the winner message, then you are safe, that match will be fine
how do i reset the leaderboard
like reset everyones mmr and stats aswell?
dw i figured it out
thanks tho
nicee
A player in my server left it and then rejoined, is it possible to recover the mmr he had before he left?
you don‚Äôt lose any stats when you leave
nvm I used /stats and it showed
i didn't know that
ty anyway
The bot isn¬¥t working on my sv
The node 2 looks like it‚Äôs running slow
can i change it to the node 1
Nope
no discord splits up the servers
i‚Äôm not sure yet what is causing the slowdown
its working now
Seems it has temporary slowdowns but then it works
probably some specific queue setup on node 2 is using up a lot of cpu
The leaderboard isn't appearing it says the q doesn't exist how should i fix it
It only appears in the specific channel the mm message is
Is it because i have two queues?
Have u tried specifying the name of the queue
If u want two queues and have the same stats i think u need to name them both the same
you can use /link from the non queue channel to the queue channel
Aigh ty
How do I clean out all time leaderboard? There are members who are top 10 who have left.
Thanks.
how so i reset everyones mmr to starters, and how do i reset leaderboard?
Do you mean clean the players that have left?
That as well, yes
From the documentation I think u can‚Äôt, maybe I‚Äôm wrong, it has ignoreroles but if they left now it‚Äôs useless
So wait till NeatZ answer u if it‚Äôs possible
Hey I cant join the queue rn? <@145305657237700608>
is it offline?
This has been happening for the past 2 days
its working now
now tells me already in queue
Yeah it will eventually work
Just hardly never on the first try
the bot hates me fr
Everything worked perfectly before node 2 ü•≤
Happening to me alsoüò≠
Same here üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
its too slow
but working now
but so so so slow
is there anyway to force vote if someone hasnt voted at the end of a game? like admin wise
U can force the win manually, but not like force a vote at the end of a game
Ahh perfect, any idea how ? Must have missed it in the doc
Appreciate the help man
U can force the win with /outcome selectwinner match_number: team_num:
is there a way to check whos in the queue?
If it‚Äôs anonymous?
yeah figured that out, ty
is there a way to custom add/subtract elo to a user
/add mmr:
If u want to decrease it put the - sign
like /add mmr:-30
okay, ty.
How can i specify in which category the new temporary channels and voice channels would be formed?
<@145305657237700608> None of the /resetstats commands are working in any of the queues for my server. Just getting ‚Äúapplication did not respond error‚Äù
The bot having problems these days but the cause is unknown yet
/channel category
How exactly should i use the command
In the category mode u put specified, and then in the category u put the category where u want the channels to be created
An example
Aight ty works fine now
<@145305657237700608> is the bot able to use custom elo gains/losses
for example when ur 0-250 elo you gain 50 per win and lose 0 per loss
you can customize the amount via /mmr change set, but you can‚Äôt have it set for mmr ranges
ah word
Hi it doesn't really work for me
How are u doing it
/ channel category category_mode:Specified category: whichever
And what does the bot answer
Wdym category wichever, is that how is called the category or it‚Äôs an example
and they don‚Äôt create in that category?
weird
<:Sedaf:456323753098477570>
it‚Äôs ignoring that category?
Yeah like that command doesn't affect anything
It's still the same
It happened recently when we cleared stats
The ‚Äúnew‚Äù category mode works, but i tried the Specified mode and doesn‚Äôt work aswell for me
In the specified mode it creates like if it was in parent mode
hmm i‚Äôll have to check it out then
Also there's another issue which i mentioned before quite some times as well
The bot bans everyone in the vc too
I had auto ban turned off due to this reason but recently turned it on and it still does this
yea i would keep it off
that‚Äôs also probably why the bot isn‚Äôt creating in the specified channel
it‚Äôs all related where the bot somehow can‚Äôt see stuff in the server, can‚Äôt see them in the voice channel, can‚Äôt see the specific category, etc
thats not the case i removed autoban but yeah the q channels are opening without category
im completly new to neat my freid recommended it tome im a little confused how it works tho
im actully pretty new to the whole server thing
We will answer ur questions üëçüèª
Is there a way to disable queue cancel and make it admins only?
you can hide the commands via the servers integration settings
Hello! When using this setup, is it possible to make that 1 or 2 players always get in the match?
So like showmatch, where 2 players always be in match and always be captains, but other players are random selected from X amount of players in queue?
yes use the priority mode and then give the players a special role that had a priority via /requeue priorityrole
Thanks
Still unable to reset stats for queues. Any known issue causing this?
what happens?
check the leaderboard, is it resetting?
nope
tried it in multiple queue channels, also tried specifying specific queues
is that the only command that isnt working for u?
do you get the confirmation popup?
does the answer in confirmation gotta be all in lowercase or it doesnt matter
if it doesnt exactly match "confirm" it will send a message saying to type confirm
nope
must be taking too long to load the player data
for now, just change the /queuename, will have to same effect
is there a cmd for "re posting the queue" delay after someone messages?
if ppl talk in the channel it gets lost in chat
/queuemessage delay
hrm interesting, i set it to 1 and it doesn't seem to repost the msg
Wdym
To 1 second?
Yeah I set /queuemessage delay to 1 and when someone types something in the channel it doesn't repost the message
It was working fine till a few days ago dunno
Queue gets lost in chat :>
Idk if it‚Äôs limited to 3 seconds
like the lowest value may be 2 or 3
But it works for me
That‚Äôs weird
I see, I'll set it back to 3 then
Well a solution for it aswell can be putting a channel just for the queue
Yeah that is an option as well üôÇ
But that‚Äôs weird, maybe it bugged
Did u try to end the queue and start it again
Or wait for neatz, he may can give u a proper solution
No I haven't tried that yet
Yeah I'll just wait
u can do try it
Just save ur config and load it again
it‚Äôs bugged
if the message doesn‚Äôt resend
i‚Äôll have to restart that node
what‚Äôs your server?
Planet RTCW
i can¬¥t put a leaderboard
i go vote to the page but no give me the leaderboard
The command doesn‚Äôt work?
no, that put i have vote but i do it and that no show me the leaderboard
Ok you already voted, and u typed  the command of /leadearboard?, and what does the bot say
he put me the message that i should vote
is like a bucle
Oh, maybe the votes are bugged again
vote to access stats!
that show me
voting should be fine, there‚Äôs already a few hundred votes this month without any issue
how can I cause the que bot to always be at the front of the chat?
I have several queues in the server and when I use /leaderboard it asks me the queue name and gives me a drop down menu, but when I click the queue it only gives me the leaderboard that was most recently linked to that channel
^ I dont want people to type in the channel that has the queue, but I also dont want to create a channel for each queue just so they can check leaderboard
you can /link to the queue channel
I said that
There are 5 queues, all with their own leaderboards, and when I cant link them all to one channel
The leaderboard command gives me an option to select which leaderboard I want to view, and it gives me a drop down menu of all of the queues in the server, but no matter which queue I pick, it only gives me the one most recently linked to that channel
guys, please advise
we have queue that made whit this bot
but i cannot turn off anonumys mode
ok i‚Äôll verify this
/anonymousqueue
when i enter that roles was remowed from queue
it shouldn‚Äôt change that at all
but you can use /roles again
im doing commands in my queue server and it says the changes are going through, but they arent actually
like i tried to add a staff results channel, and it said completed, but it never sends results there
does the bot have perms for that channel?
oh maybe not
smart
also how can I get the bot to apply a role to captains or to anyone in an active queue
/autoroles ingame
should that show up in the /info menu?
page 8
thank you
my leaderboard is currently blank, could it have to do with the fact that I changed the name of the queue?
sorry for all the questions, just added the bot last night
If u changed the name it‚Äôs like resetting stats i think
yea the stats are stored via the queue name
so either change the name back or use /migratestats
Sick thanks
That worked well
When you use /ign where does it display this tag?
in the final teams message
how do i cancel a current game
so that the queue resets
Bot is creating channels outside of the specified category, these channels now appear at the top of the server
/channel category to pick where the created channels appear
my queue message is no longer bumping to the front of chat
Yeah I know, I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs not following the instructions
Hey, sometimes the join queue button doesnt show up later in the chat
I have to restart it manually everytime
How to fix this?
/cancel or /outcome cancel (only staff)
Is it possible to create a seperate channel but have the same queue
I want a channel for veterans but that share the same elo/mmr as reguluar queu
Put the same name on both queues
<@145305657237700608> how do u make the q go to the bottom of the channel?
It should be automatically do it
bot must be trippin rn
Yeah i tested it and the queue message is not going at the bottom
yea restarting now
any update?
<@145305657237700608> ban this guy
yea he‚Äôs gone
i even have a self promo channel lmao
he just wanted to spam it lol
today i will be able to check
looks like the leaderboard is the correct data, but the title is referencing the current queue, i will fix the title though
The bot isn't dragging people from the queue VC into the team VCs
Did I enable the wrong command, or is it an issue with the bot?
also happening with me, it usually gets fixed pretty quickly
My bot is spazzing out recently
1. When it puts people in the teams, it kicks everyone out and you have to manually join the team channels.

2. When 5/6 people are in the queue waiting for the last person, it queue bans everyone that was in the vc, not the odd one out.

3. Queues are starting to make the voice channels and text channels on top of my server instead of it‚Äôs regular position.
Can anyone help me out with this? appreciated
whats the server name
Virtual Football League
yea this issue is happening too often now
im restarting node 1 to fix it
aight bet thanks
you should disable /player autoban until this is fixed
need me to cancel ongoing queues?
or anything rn?
nope
doing the same with mine atm mate, not a huge issue tbh
im little confused on setup if anyone can help
when people q how do u make it so drags you into automatic temporay voice chat
If u want all automatic, u can use /lobbychannel set
k ab try it
when q is full it will drag everyone from the lobby channel to the q channel
also checkout if u have enabled the /tempchannels
how do i know if i have it enabled
use the command
/ tempchannels
k i did that it makes it a text channel what i want but after everyone ques is there a way i can make it so theres a temp voice channel every one goes to then same thing with there teams
thats automatic
if isnt working like that maybe the bot having some bugs or idk
ye im trying test mode and it makes a text channel que it says at the top a premmison is missing but the bot has that premmison
how does the /substitute command work?
where should we the command be used? in the match chat or the queueing channel?
Match
you must have something overriding the permission
If u use the command on a channel that isn‚Äôt the match one it tells u :)
how do i fix that
check the category permissions and the role permissions
what premison overrides that problem im having everything works like getting in que text and temp text channel i just cant get it to make a temp vocie channel
what‚Äôs the exact error you see?
Permissions Error
Manage Channels
I am missing the Manage Channels permission, which I need to move and create channels!
Check my server permissions and any channel/role permission overrides!
Join the support server or /reportbug for help!
just give the bot admin permission
Or does it already have it
Hi I was wondering how you get rid of Queue names. I was testing and now I have a bunch and I am not sure how to remove it.
you can use /resetstats
for each
nah none do
Ok thank you!
even though the person being @'d cant see that channel?
Yeah, it works like that for sure, u @ the person and the bot will send them a direct message asking if they agree the sub
They need to answer in X time
the bot is having a stroke
Hey, the pop-up used to buy credits is not working very well. It only works with 5 credits, but we want 12 and when we press "Purchase" it gets us to a "undefined" page
try logging in again?
yep I just logged in, I did it after Laru told me it was not working for him
it only works with 5 credits, nothing more
do you get to the checkout page?
nope, when you click purchase it goes to a page on neatqueue.com/manage/undefined
thats strange, its working fine for me
Now its not random, its literally every queue
Hey, i have to keep forcestarting games to get a match started... Is their a solution for this?
It used to work fine
My queue is using roles and mmr
Thanks in advance
whats your /config
Queue configuration saved as: HZLBR
My config is HZLBR
it auto started for me
you have been using matchmaking?
Yes!
and hitting the 6 player requirement?
if there are not enough priority roles to fill a queue, does it choose the remaining members randomly or whoever joined first?
Idk that didn't happen yet
But my admin keeps telling me he has to /forcestart
To get the game going
by default it will be first come first serve
so it is configurable?
yea with /misc shuffleonstart
Priority will shuffle everyone but keep priority order
thanks for the clarification
<@145305657237700608> So there is no issue? I saw it happen a couple of times were it didn't start the match...
i mean it‚Äôs the matchmaking queue type, it only starts when the match will be fair enough
if you want to always start when you get 6 people, change the /queuetype to PUGs
<@145305657237700608> do people still gain mmr?
Is it possible to bypass the fair enough system?
yes it‚Äôs all the same, just changes how matches start
if you want to bypass the fairness, you shouldn‚Äôt use that queue type
Anyone else experiencing this?
Nope
I can‚Äôt save the configs because it says I‚Äôm not admin ?
Is that on purpose or am I dumb
Greetings guys and I hope that you're doing great
I was wondering if there's a way to set up the bot so when you queue the players in the queue don't get to choose which team to pick
and make it random once the queue fills up
<@145305657237700608>
/teamselection
Thank you Sir
8/8 are in queue and channels aren't being created. I changed the category setting from Parent to New, could this have affected the queue popping? <@145305657237700608>
Changed the category settings back, still having the issue. Ended queue and restarted it, same issue. Queue is filling and nothing happens after that
ZooMafia?
it says the new channel has prohibited words for server discovery?
what new channel?
if you want I can give you admin to snoop around, idk if that would help
somehow the text channel?
is it english?
it's been working all day we havent added any new text channels within the time frame of one queue working to the next not working
any idea what the last queue was called?
the text channel?
default, would have been like # queue-1487
your bot has never created a channel with any other name in ZooMafia than queue-x
yea it shouldn‚Äôt be anything else ever
i was wondering if the queue number was ‚Äúprohibited‚Äù
like 666 or something
let me see what the last few were
all were in the 1470-1480s range
shoudnt be anything in that range like 666
disable /tempchannels for a test match
maybe /voicechannels too
to see if it‚Äôs a weird number
okay
worked
queue immediately popped after changing those settings
reenable them see if the next one works?
what‚Äôs the queue number by chance?
and yea i would
1488
let me google that lol
omfg it‚Äôs a hate symbol
????
LMAO
no shot
who would‚Äôve thought
i made sure team channels can‚Äôt get blocked by that
guess i need to add queue channels
im literally mindblown
same
just my luck
Set a voice channel as a lobby
/ lobbychannel set channel:
Basically u make a voice channel, and u set it as a lobby, so if u join the q, u need to be on the voice channel and u will be dragged to the queue channel automatically when it starts
you can also use /lobbychannel pullall
it will automatically move all members to the match voice channel if they are in any channel
Awesome thank you so much!
That worked!
/ teamsize
Randomly today a bunch of the queues in my server started showing up at the top of the server without a category. I've tried running the /channel category command and doing either Parent or specifically setting the category where it should be but the bot is ignoring those commands, is there another command I can be running?
not your fault, its just happens rn
bet so it'll resolve itself when it feels like?
as long as it's not my fault irdc
im restarting now, should resolve immediately
Incredible, also random question, do you do private instances of the bot for servers by any chance? paid ofc
usually i say no... but with these issues i may revisit cuz i can imagine its very annoying
Makes sense, we love the bot and would be happy to be guinea pigs for you (Club Banana / TTV Woohoojin)
just some issues with that I havent figured out yet, like how to get the website to work with a custom instance
best case really is that i figure out what is breaking stuff after many hours of the bot running
Yeah that's always the tough part of dev work. Maintinence and squashing bugs is no fun
yea... fun stuff
Is it possible to change the pick order
Right now the lowest player picks first in matchmaking
Can this be set to random?
not currently, it‚Äôll always be the lower player
<@145305657237700608> i have a question i gave the bot admin roles with everything and it still says missing manage channels when it has it
Hey, I'm running an alternative queue "for fun" in which everyone starts at 0 mmr and has to climb the leaderboard. It was set at startingmmr 0 but I just noticed that now it's set at 1000 mmr. There's no role assigned to this role, so it's set as Everyone - 1000mmr. If I set the startingmmr to 0 without selecting a role, does it only change it for the channel i'm writing it inside? Or does it change for every other queue in the server?
only the current queue
okok thank god xdd
The bot isn‚Äôt re writing the queue msg after people type again for some reason

Server: planet rtcw
how to delete config from bot
how can I get my queue message to bump to the front again
it hasnt updated in 3 hours
hello, how do i limit the queue to only 10 players to join since its a 5v5 game
sometimes it goes to 11 people in queue and 1 person gets left out
/teamsize
to 10
thanks!
i still showed that theres 11 people in queue
we got 10 people and its not creating a game
can some one help with the names for the mmr system so like it auto changes the mmr to there name
what shall i do gentlemen
join support i will help at least try
Show
What
can u give me like 30
we just got in a game
also i did team size 10 which was not right cuz its supposed to be a 5v5 not a 10v10 lol
i was tryign to limit the queue to only 10 people so anyone after cant join
But like
Whats ur queue config
Oh yeah 5
can some one help with the names for the mmr system so like it auto changes the mmr to there name
what does the /register do?
change your /queuetype to PUGs
will initialize your MMR using the specified games account
needs /requireregister first
same to you, change the /queuetype to PUGs
if you want MMR in discord names then use /ratinginnames
Register üòé
wdym initialize
your starting mmr
oh so what it does when people queue anyway
if you are 1533 MMR in rocketleague, you start at 1533 NeatQueue MMR
how does the format work?
just read the command description it says
is there a way to force registration but it not affect mmr? I want to ban some people and not allow them to join on alt discord accounts
nothing like that no
sadge
like that <@145305657237700608>
i am dumb
registering needs admin supervision really since it‚Äôs honor system
you just say you account name, but can easily lie
have you even tried?
ok so what didn‚Äôt work
we are testing it out
It‚Äôs simple üëåüèª
thanks, it worked
how do you make it where people can host with out admin perms
<:monkaW:976227202918133841>
only admins need to start the queue, players can just join over and over
Would it be possible to have an option for created voice channels to only be visible to Staff & players in that queue? I started using the new category option but now there's an insane amount of channels in a non-staff's view.
hmm usually new channels inherit the category perms, but for new categories that wouldn‚Äôt work
will need to add a customization for the specified category :/
maybe the created categories should inherit the permissions of the queues original category?
Does People need admin to used ranked drafts?
if you mean create queues, yea
is their a bypass
no there‚Äôs no reason to
thats the way it is right now i think. whats happening is out of 15k members, 5k have the "CoD 8's" role, which is required to see any of the queue channels. But that still leaves 4900 people who arent playing with sooo many extra channels than they wanted
is there a way to make a voice channel and keep it in that channel so it does not make vcs
yea i get that
can people with the role usually see the voice channels?
You mean queue vc's before i changed the category rule?
Yes. The difference is, if they had the parent category collapsed, it stayed collapsed
Parent / defined category would solve my problem but we've been having the issue where created channels arent being categorized at all, and are appearing at the top of the server
Also before I forget to ask again, how do I get the premium role?
yea that‚Äôs just the common bot issue, might be working right now, maybe not
did you buy the credits?
Yes I did, it's been a few months though
<:TE_Shrug:856060385433616384>
i‚Äôll add manually
i changed plans and got the role auto
seems to have worked LOL
nah changing plans wouldn‚Äôt do anything
well
im green now
woooo
Were you saying this is the common issue or the credits thing
is there a way to make a voice channel and keep it in that channel so it does not make vcs
you can just disable voicechannels if you don‚Äôt want the bot to make them
but it will still work the same?
The bot seems to be banning people even tho they join the vc
disable /player autoban for now
I am trying to make it so certain members of my community can use /leaderboard. I have made it so the role can use application commands, but that doesn't seem to work. Is there a way for me to add roles so they can use /leaderboard, but also making it so they cannot change peoples elos?
you can change visibility of commands in the servers Integration settings
So do I got to commands I want and add roles to that?
This is what I am looking at
How do you remove require register
Or set it up atleast
I do /register account: then what do I put?
/requireregister mode:None
Thanks
When it says register account details what do I put
Ur acc
name with the numbers i think
Like if it was valorant it would be like name#3424
I think
But u need to set wich game
Thank you!
It says this Error fetching your Rainbow 6 rating. Make sure the account is formatted correctly!
what is causing the queue message to not bump to the front
Bot bugging then
It works for me
If the team size is 1 and the number of teams is 4, it will be 1vs1vs1vs1. Is it possible to have 2 random 1vs1?
yea set the /numberofteams to 2, and the /numberoflobbies to 2
Thank you!! I'll try
It worked as expected. thank you!
I need help the auto roles is not working.
what is it doing
when i add mrr to someone should it change the role when  supposed to?
Yeah
How did u config ur roles?
yep what
can u show me how did u config ur autoroles, or did u solve it
My queue is not working
same
are the servers down?
Looks like
Same
neatqueue.com says offline but the status page says healty
sounds like any doctor
can leave queue but can‚Äôt join‚Ä¶
also it wont start with full queue, thought we were having that problem again but its not queue specific this time
ah shit it‚Äôs the database
<:monkaW:976227202918133841>
https://tenor.com/view/six-consoles-gif-18235661
And here‚Äôs when everyone starts joining the server
timeframe?
not sure
remind me to setup a replica db lmao
Always have a backup!
i have plenty of backups
just from 4am
oh nice
having alot of issues with the bot not letting me qeueu
and don't wanna reset because it'll mess with points
The bot is kinda having problems rn
gotcha
my queue is broke and no one can queue
yeah everyone experiencing it
gotcha
DB provider estimating 20 minutes
Btw the player ban command still bugged?
long 20 minutes
/player autoban?
Bot in my server is not letting people vote for the mvp of their game so games wont close without it manually being forced
And no one can join queues
The bot isn‚Äôt working at all rn
Sadge
hard to give an ETA, i don‚Äôt own the hardware the database is on so i can‚Äôt do much
it is my fault for not having a replica set up for failover though
No its all good man, just trying to pass the word.
ur a g
hmmm, probs an issue with processing all the clicks at the same time, i should probs update so they are processed 1 by 1
there is a validation to make sure that if you click a team that is full, it wont let you
but with everyone clicking at the same time 2 people could slide by that validation
and end up with too many people on the team
<@145305657237700608> beta bot doesn't seem to respect the results channel and just posts in the queue channel anyway?
not a huge deal, just making you aware if it is not known, channel is not linked but iirc i didnt link them before for results to publish
same perms for both?
should work the exact same
<@145305657237700608> bot is under maintenance, do you have any predictions for it?
<@145305657237700608> yo, the bot in a server is not working, cant join ques, the games that has been scored for the last 6 days hasnt been counted for
<#919709100114346076>
Ah thanks bro
it seems I had to link the channel
that worked to fix it
Is an announcement going out when things are back to normal?
yes i will send a message and mention alerts
do we get like premium for a bit for the time it was out etc?
sure i‚Äôll give everyone 2 weeks free
i think i have basic
bc i was close to game limit
anyone without premium gets 2 weeks Basic, anyone with premium gets 2 weeks extension
makes sense
ty for clarification ^^
In the neatq web
Log in with ur discord acc and go to Dashboard
<@773200669032841247> !!!!!
How do I stop neatqueue from kicking people for inactivity? I have a queue going for a game in 8 hours and it keeps kicking people from the queue. I just wanted a first come first serve list without any time limits or requirements needed. Is there a way to just make a simple queue without any requirements?
It‚Äôs basically that u can re shuffle the teams made in random team selection
If the first team random selection isn‚Äôt good u can re shuffle it
/timer afk toggle:False
I think in captains mode too idk
and captain selection if the captains are random
so smart
omg neatz
Last night was the saddest night
saddest day too
When did the server hit 1K lol ggs
why the saddest night
farming users
trying to get discovery status
Neatq bot down
Real
I did that, and it said the timer would be disabled, but then everyone got kicked out of the queue again... I like to start queues a couple hours ahead of time, then refer to the queue list when it's time for me to stream but Neatqueue has never kept the queue up for people to see.. Anytime the queue fills up, it disappears or it kicks everyone out and starts over again.  I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to be but it has been incredibly frustrating asking everyone in my server to queue up every time the queue resets itself for no reason.
Are u using neatq beta
change /timer queuereset
although it sounds different
i was afraid of saying that bc of that lol
if i export a config using NQ-beta, can it be used for the OG NQ bot?
~~wait how do you even save a config in NQ-beta lol~~ found it, need to `/save` researching helps
I would say yea, but im obviously not sure
no, any data that is created on the beta bot will not transfer back to the main
(unless it is revealed that the data was lost but that hasn‚Äôt been said)
oh i see
will the beta bot stay live or will there be moments where it goes offline for extended durations?
i.e. does it act like permanent staging for new features?
it goes offline very frequently
at least for now i directly release new features, no staging for the public
i don‚Äôt see a public staging bot as necessary since i roll out features regularly opposed to release cycles
uh, what does premium offer?
U can look at the page of the bot
Log in and go to dashboard
There‚Äôs 3 diff plans
how to fix?
I would suggest to still use the NeatQueue-Beta Bot instead of the regular one since the Main one is still not 100% at the moment. I could be wrong tho.
the netq bot is down atm
does beta bot keeps it stats? my server switched over to it, gonna use it until a ladder reset until september was the plan
the stats the beta bot saves are only for the beta bot, the stats saved on beta wont migrate to the main bot
monthly rollover of ladder means full reset, right?
we were thinking of using it until september maybe, then go back to main bot
not sure
but neatz said the beta bot goes off frequently
yes, the beta bot is used for testing, if im not testing then its offline
do we know an estimated time on when the bot will be back?
<#919709100114346076> u can take a guess from that
thank you
Is there a reason why the queue for the bot sometimes doesn‚Äôt go to the bottom of the channel?
Just gets stuck and lost in messages sometimes lmao
I cant login to the website, is that supposed to happen or?
try now, realized the server was never restarted while down
yeah works now ty
wait
dashboard wont load now
o_o works fine for me
what do you see
brave
is that an issue or?
works fine on edge so idk
hi, can you migrate this config. I'm a bit unsure if its the correct one tho, cause i prompted beta bot, but used in the channel where i set up the queue with original bot (i made a different text channel when i started queue for beta bot with same config. It started with same player scores from 1 days removed, but now it says no queue running) NeatQueue-Beta
BOT
 ‚Äî Today at 4:10 PM
Queue configuration saved as: PKNFX
ok, maybe its this one: LGDJP
Are you able to migrate even if we start playing on the main bot? <@145305657237700608>
both configs have been migrated
ok ty
config migrates, not games?
my bad, i was hopeful, its essentially the same config. i did see post about games wont carry over
yes only config, no stats
ok thx anyways. good work on bot, keep it going boss üòÑ
I would like to know about this! 
https://discordapp.com/channels/505102060119916545/910981294937210930/938243762180743258
Not 100% sure, but my guess is that u can do this by /mmr requirement
its better if you use `/autoroles` and then add `/rolerequirement`
that way you can utilize the lower lose threshold of autoroles, so that you can be below the threshold of a rank but still play in that rank's queue
oh i see
nice
thank you!
I have one more question.
I would like to create a Matchmaking Queue for each rank and then merge them into one (managed by one Leaderborad).
To separate queues by rank as in this image, do I create a queue for each channel? Or is there a way to share a queue to multiple channels?
To share stats between multiples queues u need to name them all with the same Queue Name, to separate queues by rank as in the image, u need to create a queue for each channel, and u you will need to update the ```/role requirement``` for each queue
i tested it, and i think u cant share stats of everyone in one leaderboard since u have role requirement, i don¬¥t know if its possible
I see! Thanks for the details! I'll give it a try!
also if you are trying it to be the same queue with the same config, just create the reference one and do ***/save***, to save the config, and to create a queue with the same config u do ***/load [config_code]***, so u dont need to set up everything again for each queue
u just will need to change the role requirement
yea, the leaderboard will only show players with the role requirement
only real fix is to make a hidden queue with no role requirement, then show that leaderboard
I see! That's good!
Thank you for answering my question! It was helpful!
Good evening guys and I hope that you're doing great, I've been trying to set up some PUGs but I keep getting this error, I'm not sure if I'm setting something wrong on my end
https://i.imgur.com/eX8WbA9.png
make sure roles are not overriding the bot¬¥s perms
category settings, server roles, etc
Thank you kindly
I was wondering also if there's a possibility if I'm playing a competitive fps to make the bot in PUGs mode to make the captain select the game mode that they wish to play alongside with the map that he wants to play on?
Because I've seen as for example, on call of duty games once they decide to choose which individuals will be the captains they can choose the gamemode that they desire to play and the map as well
yup just add the gamemode for each map you `/map add`
so I can just do /addmap "x map" and that's it?
thank you!
map add
and if u want for a gamemode u have it too
You guys are so goated
I love the idea of /register, for allocating accurate mmr, but is there where this is *optional*? I have some people who are unranked, therefor the API won't pull there mmr, but I have no problem giving them a number themselves, however other people would much rather have the bot pull its mmr
if they are not registered they can¬¥t play?
Correct, because they get this error "Make sure the account is formatted correctly!", which is because they don't have ranked games on their account (I presume), but if I turn off the requirement to register, than no one can register and thus their mmr doesn't get set by the bot, is there any way to bypass this?
which game?
i did `/requireregister`, but it doesnt force me to register if i want to play uhh
i did it with valorant
you might have MMR already
lemme see
I'm currently trying it for overwatch, with my own account which has no ranked games
But it does look like, if you do /requireregister but the account already has mmr within the bot, then they can queue up which would allow me to bypass the requirement for unranked accounts
i have 0 mmr, enabled requireregister with valorant, and even if i dont reg it lets me play, is it bypassing it? or am i doing something wrong
u can manually add mmr, with `/add mmr`, but u should make a role for unranked ones that sets automatically an mmr, so u dont have to do it manually for every guy
Yeah, that would work I just wasn't aware that was how you could bypass the requireregister
But that's perfect!
i dont think it should bypass lul
perhaps registering should use the startingmmr if the account exists but no mmr is found
Hey i need help on starting the bor
Send how you want it to be set up :)
Is there a command to move all players in any VC into the queue channel once queue gets filled?
I've been looking through the list but I'm not spotting it.
`/lobbychannel pullall`
as long as you have voice channels enabled
I thought that was an instant command and not a toggle cause the description gets cut off. Discord limitations. Thank you kindly.
Does the basic tier allow the footer/header/logo editing?
premium basic ye
The difference between premium plans are the players, number of queues and daily matches üëçüèª
Does `/lobbychannel pullall` pull people to Queue channel that forms once queue is full (the step before separating teams). It's not working in my server. What did you mean by 'voice channels enabled'?
This is voice channels enabled
the description for this looks to be wrong what does this do
And yes, it should pull people to queue channel vc
That means to do the Team Voicechannels
the bot already auto moves teams to Team channels after queue voting is done
That‚Äôs how it works
Is there a `lobbychannel pullall` command *before* match starts (pre-voting)? It does `lobbychannel pullall` after match starts (post-voting)
I want players to 1. be pulled into Queue channel and then 2. pulled into their team channels. Only step 2 works, but step 1 doesn't.
To be pulled into the queue channel using lobbychannel pullall means u have to be in a vc, and it should work like u said, it pulls everyone on the queue if they‚Äôre on a voice channel before eveything starts
And that only works if voicechannels is required?
I had that setting off, just toggled it to required, so hopefully it works
bought premium btw, very nice bot
Yep, because if u have them disabled there won‚Äôt be any queue vc created
Queue vc is created, it just doesn't pull players, they have to manually join the Queue vc.
do you have lobbychannel pull all toggled right
And voice channel mode to required right
The optional mode won‚Äôt work for this
Gotcha. voicechannels required did the trick. Everyone gets pulled into Queue channel now. Thank you üôè
did you update this?
the validation doesnt seem to work... if ppl dont click at the same time it is still bugged
no this wasnt fixed
yea i understand what is happening i just cant fix until the beta bot goes offline for me to test
What is the format the bot wants for /register? Trying name# but it keeps returning an error, for Overwatch
ex: NeatZ#11354
Is that example valid? (I just want to see it working) When I use that, or one of my 2 ranked accounts, it gives this error message "Error fetching your Overwatch rating. Make sure the account is formatted correctly!"
for some reason that API isnt showing my stats either
actually i think im private profile right now
ill update the error to include a check for that
oooh that makes sense gotcha
Some players are running into trouble subbing themselves, interaction is failing -- rate limit issue ?
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1129533651433029803/1129535684504453140/image.png
hmm not seeing anything suspicious
just clicking confirm?
how can i disable automatic re queue c:
like after a match is cancelled?
does anyone know how to hide the MMR during captain selection?
`/mmr change hidden`
hmmm no that is automatic
oh rip, thanks anywyas
hey i have a question
how do u change where if u lose a lot of games it stops at 0 mmr rather than getting negative mmr
you can set a /mmr floor 0
yeah, we manually admin subbed but just showing this in case there was a logged error somewhere
no worries
Should i just run it again
./add decaygraceperiod 604800 @player
Looks like the time input isn‚Äôt working at all and it‚Äôs throwing errors
can we use the sub command after we find a queue and make our teams and the game have started..... or it could only be used once we get a queue but before splitting the players into 2 teams
i wanted to make a sub at this moment:
Yeah u can
<:Thonk:356771720863940608> i see an error, will fix today
just so you know, the decay extension was successful, there was just an issue responding to the command
Perfect thanks
Yo so im having some problems with the autolocker, the queue unlocks fine, but then dosent lock afterwards. Do i need to run the /lock autolock true time 2100 command again after i manually lock it to make it automatic again
make sure u put the correct time depending on the timezone u chose
yo, so in my voting menu its currently not showing the voting buttons, is this because i have too many choices, i have quite a lot in there
just type the name of the option you want
keep forgetting to add that message
i know you can do /vote and the option but we prefer the buttons, is the way to get the buttons back to remove some of the choices
if you have more than 25 options, no buttons
thats the max
gotcha
discord limit
gotcha hmmm, is there a way to randomise the options displayed and only display 25
nah it will always show the 25 options currently
yeah gmt for both
it was supposed to lock 4 hours ago
Im gonna test it to see if it‚Äôs working but it should be
oh u need to enable the repeat option
or after it locks it doesnt work again even if u have the repeat option?
i keep meaning to rework the whole thing
i want to add the ability to schedule execution of all commands
it works for me
das weird
its set to true
/lock all:True auto_lock:True repeat:True timezone:GMT time:21:00
oh okey
How do you change the mmr they get each match?
/mmr change
put static to true if u don‚Äôt want any variance btw
Wdym
There‚Äôs mmr variance, like if u have lower mmr than the other person for example if you win you‚Äôre gonna win more mmr than the set one
So if u want to win for example 20 mmr no matter what mmr the other team has out it to static
Do know how to make it random
Wdym random
That‚Äôs by default so no worries
yea there isn‚Äôt any randomness is the elo calculation, but it will vary
Oh ok so what do I do again
`/mmr change set`
Can you call and explain this to me?
i still dont get it
Gonna use my server for example
U see how everyone doesn‚Äôt win and lose mmr the same mmr
That‚Äôs basically the variance
U will lose or win depending on your mmr and other ones
You: **Higher MMR** Vs Person 2: **Lower MMR**= If You loses, Person 2 will gain more mmr than usual, If You wins will gain less mmr
can you help me set it up
Do you wanna do variance? Or just win and lose mmr no matter mmr of others
variance
U can use the default variance
Is good
That‚Äôs the one i use
how?
Or i u want more noticeable changes use the calculator on the docs to calculate
It‚Äôs by default enabled
ok so it is alr enabled?
yea it is
But I want it noticeable
i mean
It‚Äôs already noticeable
Not really
`/mmr change variance` ***Lower value = Higher ranges of MMR Change*** `Default Variance is: 1600`
Then then what do you think is a good number
The calculator: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3qtwvlrw8q
Bro how tf do I use that
lol then just put 1000 on your mmr variance
Should be good
1000?
on mmr variance
Not change set
Do /mmr change variance
Thanks
old default used to be 800 like a year ago
Wait is it the calculator not working well or am i tripping
seems fine to me
we have about 4 queues running in one server, one leaderboard has the infinite load and no stats, potentially because there haven't been enough games but I think we've had more than 5 for at least some of the players. Any potential troubleshooting I can do?
https://getrekt.cc/GFgh7j.png
i'll just keep watching it, might fix itself üôÇ
Does the web leaderboard one works?
Must be a discord thing
if you click the image and open in browser, does it load?
nope
nothin
I want to say its *maybe* because there aren't enough games? But T3 has played a few I know that, I can't be certain since I haven't been watching every hour
Do you have required games?
wdym?
There‚Äôs an option of required games to appear on the leaderboard
Nothing I have set explicitly, I know that leaderboard requires 5 games
whats the command to change it/
this is new to me :0
`/leaderboardconfig requiredgames`
got it ```/leaderboardconfig requiredgames games:```
yeeee
thanks
will try
crazy
Aight
all set üôÇ I don't remember this command from before, appreciate it!
how do get the logs from the games>
/staffchannel set
like nothing in terms of no data? or the image doesn‚Äôt load?
image just infinite loads, no data -- It was 100% not enough matches because of a config I didn't know I had set. I pulled pro city config and it has 5 required matches needed, I set that to 1 and now it is all good
Just me being dum
Appreciate you
hmm it should still load, even if no data it would just be an empty image
yeah, for all others it does that
but this one was just being weird
wish I could tell you why but all other queues work as intended (not enough matches, just empty image)
honestly could be a discord thing
if the image is dead it would show a special dead image from discord
who knows lmao
wouldn't be suprised if it was a weird discord thing
good thing i have this sticker

Any update?
How many matches are allowed daily with the basic free plan of the bot?
I cant seem to find that info anywhere
Free is 50 matches limit per day
Got it thank you
currently using neatqueue across multiple university esports societies across the UK

Was wondering if there‚Äôs a limit on amount of servers that can be in the cross chats

So I‚Äôll fully give perms to the bot and channel perms, join correctly, and the messages will still not come through
running into a lot of issues with it if anyone can assist me
Im using the bot for a Splatoon 3 draft comp server, if we get the basic 5$ plan is that a monthly payment or a one off payment?
Monthly
Got it.
Thank you
I just got aired so hard
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
how many servers are u running
Currently 20 or so are in the crosschat
Currently 30 or so waiting to join
but it wont add them properlyüò≠
But u do the cross chat and the messages don‚Äôt appear on other servers?
Any more issues?
no that‚Äôs it
Like on some occasions it wont appear on either sides of the chats
On some occasions it‚Äôll come from point a to point b
But b can‚Äôt text a
And vice versa
Maybe the amount of servers can overload the node
I see
that is probs it tbh
So, let‚Äôs wait till the developer answer u if it‚Äôs that, or any other issue
We‚Äôve got around 10-20k people in each channel atm
Uhm yeah that can overload maybe
Not sure at all
I‚Äôll wait for mister neatz
yep, it‚Äôs better
is one of the nodes slow rn?
i could see crosschat maybe slowing things down if there was a lot of chatting but haven‚Äôt tested
if that would be true, it would need to become its own bot
idk what happened
had to close the crosschats
so some of the messages weren‚Äôt sending?
was everyone able to join the crosschat?
limit was like
15/20 uni discords
what do you mean limit
like what was happening
just wouldnt let anyone else join the crosschat
would say it jhoined
then the bot just wouldnt take the messages
sounds like it should be fixable
well maybe
you could try again with slowmode
Is there an ability too remove the random and the unfair teams picking mode?
How?
`/team selection`
Choose as many u want, don‚Äôt choose random and unfair
I just put the names?
A dropdown list will show
You just have to select the ones u want
No drop list
Enter
Thank you! I did it
Noice üëåüèª
Sorry another question, do you have too use the enable MMR so the points are given or is it automatic even if they dont hit it?
with a tie vote, it enables by default, so if nobody votes it will default enabled
Got it thank you!
And if u want to make sure it‚Äôs always enabled and that someone can‚Äôt vote disable run /mmr change allow_disable, and set it to false üëçüèª
Got it thank you for your help
How to cahnge the timer of team selection ?
`/timer votes`
its less than a minute and sometimes ppl are getting random teams since they dont get to make the teams in that time
How many queues can you set up with the free basic plan?
Differnt queues
less than 10
lemme give u an exact number brb
wait, everyone has basic premium plan so i cant see tbh
I see
We need 2
ok i got the information
max 3 queue
Ok epic!
Whenever we try too sub a player it says interaction failed- we have tested it multiple times on different servers with different people
They can‚Äôt accept or deny without it saying that
hmm i‚Äôll check it out, i think it‚Äôs the same thing Kotri  was seeing
Second test
Another server
While neatz check out what‚Äôs happening u can try /player sub that is Admin only use
Didn‚Äôt work either unfortunately
I tried both
Im telling everyone too report scores and then ping the mods too have it cancelled
players can vote to cancel via /cancel as well
something must be up with subs
Thanks we will let everyone know!
It said they were not in a match or couldnt be found
The /cancel?
then something bugged out
Nah the cancel worked
We just couldn‚Äôt get the sub to work
Thanks for the help though
Ah Alright
`/player sub` seems to work fine
something is broken with the prompt in DMs
We will test it again later and see if it works
Player sub works for me
<@648635725964902411>
`/resetstats` for each
that how I delete all of them
is this the right que running is looks
like its not running the right onw
<@145305657237700608>
no thats a different name
meaning
thats not the stats for the running queue
How do we make it the right one?
the queue name is `Ranked drafts`
you dont have any stats for that name
so its not showing
So What does that mean.
just do /leaderboard, you dont need the name
join the queue, and you will now see that queue name in /leaderboard queue_name:
it shows thatr
that
right
can we talk to a staff in vc
or plan a meeting
about what
the bot
so we can stop all the confusion
it doesnt have to be you
since you dont like to join vc
<@145305657237700608>
just write out your questions really
im not sure what you are confused about currently
the ranked que not
showing up
the leader board not showing
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
the stats on the names not working
you reset the stats for that queue name
so there are no stats
the queue name is "Ranked drafts"
you just ran this command `/resetstats all queue_name:Ranked drafts`
all the stats are now gone
what about teh nickname promblems
onnce i do that
what do I do nex
what problems
is there a way to refresh the names?
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=ratinginname-toggle
just create a queue with the name you want
thats all you need to do
dont end the queue, change the name, etc
What about the nicknames?
`/queuename`
changed the name
is that good
<@145305657237700608>
what about the nickanmes
what about them
The roles aren‚Äôt changing for the old score
I want I add the pontine
Points but the names aren‚Äôt changing
bro what?
Their points on the leadboard aren‚Äôt being lined up with the points on their name
Like if give some mmr it doesn‚Äôt show on leadboard or their name
if its not on leaderboard or in their name, then you didnt give them any MMR
I going to test
and see if it works
you can see in the most recent que they got plus 33 points
what does the leaderboard show
How exactly does the anticheat work?
How do I change mmr balancing to random?
Like team selecton?
Like how it splits the teams
/ teamselection
Press enter and select random
First you gotta put an anticheat flag channel by `/anticheat channel`, then you enable it with `/anticheat enable`, and u can use and enable wichever four options, anticheat streak, rejoin, incorrectvoting, newaccounts, u set parameters for each one if u want or just one that you might like, for example anticheat streak, u have to set at what streak it should flag the player, when the condition triggers it will send an msg to the anticheat channel showing the player info and why the trigger runned, also u can add a role to someone that triggers the anticheat options u put
Ah thank you.
can someone explain why he's getting this much elo
shouldnt the high elo player be getting less elo for beating 900s
they are on a 23 game streak, the streak multiplier is large
OHH OK
yea thats wild
Dayumn
leaderboard is just blank for me
after i have reset points
and people have played games snd been rewarded since
Make sure is the leadeaboard for the queue u want to, and refresh it
i only have once a
and i insert the q name
and it still isn‚Äôt working
what server ID ?
1128167331642748999
and you are just doing `/leaderboard` ?
also tried it with the q name
U sure they played games
ah i see nvm
https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/1128167331642748999/1128598574884732948
works fine online as well
what‚Äôs the reason it is not showing up in server
you can invite me and ill check
sent a inv
is there a way to set it where points won‚Äôt go below 0? <@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>
u mean mmr?
`/mmr floor mmr:0`
ok thank tou
any update?
ran into an issue where refreshing shows the wrong queue again, still working on it
what is the base register limit
can you add mmr to a player without using a q as an admin? the sub command doesnt work and the sub won but the OG player got points and the sub none
You can just add mmr to a player being admin by `/add mmr`
and the sub command it¬¥s a weird event
i think the sub command is not working at all, so dont use it atm
Can a mod not admin be set to see q channels and join q vcs without giving them admin perms or joining the q?
If so how
`/spectatorrole add` So a user can join any vc of the queue
Will that apply to everything or just new q's
Cuz i can not join the current ones vs or see channel
Did u create a role? And gave u that role?
A role was already created named mod
Then i did the command
I was correct it updates to new qs
did u fix it?
I did nothing i just waited for a new q to open and i can join the vc and see channel
oh u added the role in a running queue
it shouldnt be matter tbh
Are we able too have a queue start with 5 and 4 players on a team in the team vs team queue? It wont let us do it rn we have too be 4 on a team but some teams have 5
hmmmm no team vs team queue requires the team size to match
perhaps though it should just require the minimum players, but allow more
Says we have too be 3 too queue
yea exactly
We also tried too join with 4
And I didn‚Äôt let me
It said i need 3 too join
exactly
Our question is are we able too join a team queue meant for 4 people but with a party of 5 ?
Cuz the subbing doesn‚Äôt work
Unless a mod does it
But we would have too change the size every time a team of 5 wants too play
you'll have to sub
It‚Äôs broken
What does he want to do?
forgot to restart, doing it now
to fix
like 4v5 or wut
It‚Äôs a 4v4 but a party with 5 players not 4
Cuz some teams have 5 players and they want all their teammates too be in the queue
Too sub them in
We want a group of people to be able to join like 5 fot exampls so then they can sub in if needed but it will still always be a 4v4
<:AHAHA:1114611511244095580>
oh ok
NeatZ probably fixed the sub command
one min
The updates are gonna be in the next restart
nvm its still broken apparently, wut
admin command works fine but not player cmd
oh it works on Node 1
node 2 didnt pull update tf
how to make mmr not reset plz
Wdym
at the end of the month our mmr got reset
Don‚Äôt have a clue what causes it but it can be the leaderboard config
Try /leaderboardconfig monthly toggle:Disabled
i changed the setting, thank you
We have 2 queues:
1 for solo
1 for team of 4

when clicking on the solo queue one it prompts if you want to queue with a team
can this be disabled so it will not ask and only be solo for that specific q
yes disable /partyqueue
And that will only apple to the queue channel i do the command in right
you can make it so when a party reaches a certain mmr it will auto matically give them all a role and take away right
Well u can‚Äôt set for a party, just by mmr with /autoroles mmr set, it‚Äôs individual
I had a quick question for some reason the bot is automatically queuing people. Do you why this is happening and how to stop it?
After a match is cancelled for example?
It keeps putting us into the queue even if we don't click it
/requeue matchcancelled mode:Disabled
so there is no way I can set it so a team gains/loses the same amount
everyone in that team will have a separate mmr
or party/team whatever you want to call it
u can change it by /mmr change set
and enabling the static mode
So everyone will gain or lose the same mmr
Alr this sounds good tysm
Is the premium permanent or monthly?
Monthly
Alright
<@648635725964902411> i bought it for the 4th slot in queues if the subscription runs out does that queue get deleted?
I have 4 queues active now
Probably im not sure
But it will stop working i guess
When ppl join que it doesnt show their @ is that bc it still shows the setup and we have to play a match for it to work properly or do i gotta delete the message and make the like "setup message" autosend itself?
Send me the code of your queue that shows the problem
Do /save
I dmed you it
Is it bc it still says setup?
do /anonymousqueue mode:Disabled
Alright
It fixed it
Thanks!
How do you delete maps from a queue
Incase i typo or smth
<@648635725964902411>
Basically edit a setup
just /map remove
Is there a way to make it so the queue and results are 2 seperate channels
The results do go in results but they also go in queue
Want queue to just be queue
yes via </resultschannel:998281213657751658>
God tier support server
My server is perfect now
Is there a way to lower the vote timer <@145305657237700608>
60 seconds is super long
Nvm i found it
Any ability to have time based bans for players breaking rules/etc? For example, assign a "Banned role" to them for X period of time?
Currently I think I can make/leverage another bot to just have time based roles but just wondering in here too
no there isn‚Äôt anything like that, another bot would work great for it, you could set the role as a banned role too
yeah, thats what I'm going to set up, just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing a feature lmaoo
i need to test if the AI makes up some bs
also, potentially a toggle for "global" on some settings would be nice for servers with multiple queues, just realized this after setting the same banned role in 8 different queues. Definitely a minimal/niche issue but could be nice
and LOL it can do that?
lets see
that is true, would be annoying to add some sort of toggle to every command though
thats valid
surely not all commands are applicable, but I'm going to be setting up operator classes in this server later and I think my best solution is do it to one then copy config to the rest and rename
it should preserve the leaderboard I imagine? It's all tied to the queue name after all
yea copy pasting is the easiest work around
resend your message
any fix for bot doin' this lately?
https://getrekt.cc/3bEIoX.png
or is it just discord api rate limiting
i tried copying the user id listed but I can't even figure out who it is, just says unknown user
its a discord issue, cant do anything about it
your client doesn't have those users in the internal cache so it just shows IDs
any way I can force cache all the users?
(for my client)
im not aware tbh, besides loading a message from them
u could put ign next to the name if they have them? that probably would work
<@700656388262592512> all servers were given 2 weeks premium about 2 weeks ago
you probs just didnt notice any difference
<@145305657237700608>how do i fix a broken queue?
i think we did too many games
now it wont start even when its filled
What does it say
thanks for the info
nothing
it just stays full
when a 9th player joins it usually fixes it but normally it stays frozen
U can try to end the queue and start it again
Just save ur queue code and load it again
usually that means an issue with permissions i think
how do i fix premison over ride i gave it all the perms in channels and in its role i just dont know what it means
if u gave the bot a role higher than the neatqueue role itself check the role that is higher has the correct permisions
and check category perms too
its at the top under wick bot but that wick bot has Bot perms does that affect it
i meant the roles
bruh
u were in the server remeber and the only way it worked if it was admin and u tryed everything
oh its you lol
my freind has it and he told me to do that but it still doesnt work
hmm weird
LMAO Bro im losing full
something is for sure overriding but its hard to see what it is
i can prob find it but idk what it even means like i gave it everything for everything cat and roles i jus dont understand where to look i been tryna do this for am in]
<@648635725964902411> rq after the bot makes a temp channel i go to the perms in that cat of the temp channel and it doesnt have that role is that a problem
what do you mean
when the bot drags into a temp channel the roles manage channels is off
is on x mode or just neutral
Idk what this means
(Forget the 9) it stays on 8
Usually if 9 ppl are in for a bit itll force it out
your queue type is matchmaking, there is no guarantee at a match
You sure its 4v4
change it to /queuetype PUGs
Matchmaking type i forgot
could also not be 4v4 lol
`Matchmaking: Players join the queue, and once there are enough players within their MMR range, a match is created`
Thanks
I didnt know what PUGs meant
i‚Äôll add some extra info to the queue types
So when i made a queue i accidently entered setup twice and tried to purge the channel with dyno and it made a false queue (i deleted that channel) so currently it has 0 channels but the queue itself exists how do i delete it?
Heres some context ^
Does endqueue allow you to choose any queue or does it judt delete the queue currently in that channel
<@145305657237700608>
Deletes the one in that channel
So theres 0 way to get rid of that
To delete a queue u should‚Äôve do /resetstats in the channel of the queue
So rip
<:ComPepeKekw:913997051291910144>
We can manually delete it i think but Im not sure
What‚Äôs your server id
Wdym
Idk what this is
Like the channel id
Or the invite to the server
Server
Or what
How do i get the server id
Or give me the name
Of your server
The names just "Competitive"
<@648635725964902411>
1131378946324316262
I believe this bug happened in the previous 2v2 queue
But as i said i deleted the channel so its just like there
But like
The queue name just converted to purge
Wdym
Like the queue name is ?purge 3
Yea but i wanna get rid of that
Its bc when i was doing setup i ran setup twice
So 1 was 2v2 1 was ?purge 3 in the same channel
Maybe u can try on a random channel do /startqueue and put ?purge 3 as the queue name, then do /resetstatsall for that queue
That worked!
Thanks brotha
Oh noice
I also noticed this thing where if you have 2 maps with the same name (seperate gamemodes) and map bans happens itll ban them both for 1 ban
So like Raid (S&D) Raid (hardpoint) map bans would ban both for 1 map ban even though its 2 maps bc it has the same name
Easy workaround is to name them seperately but just puttin awareness to it
yea that was kinda intentional
if you ban a map, doesn‚Äôt matter what gamemode, it‚Äôs banned
Is there a way to make it so each team gets a private text channel instead of a vc for certain games that call for "deck submission" but the enemy cant see what deck theyre running?
you can send messages in voice channels now
if you join the voice channel and click the message button
Ohhh
Ok so, what I want to do is to have a 3v3 match and 20 mmr+ for win and -10 for loss. I want to have like a channel opened when a game starts where people vote for gamemode and who won. And then after the game have teh results be posted in a another channel.
I'm not rlly sure what commands to use..
have u done /setup?
The ai is kinda wrong so if u need help
This is the config u want
`Queue: /startqueue queuename:Name teamsize:3 numberofteams:2
MMR WIN/LOSS: /mmr change set amount:20 loser_mmr:10 static:True
RESULTS: /resultschannel`
alright
this AI might need to go away until more training lol
how do you add vcs per team if you previously didnt have them
like whats the command
/ voicechannels teamchannels
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/1131752660740083763/1132536537721098311
The AI's hallucinating!
Copying this here, because I could use some help with this:
> How do I query the API to list matches played within a certain date range?
Well that isn‚Äôt on the documents aswell
If you‚Äôre using a custom api u should know how the api works
And how to access the data with the webhook
But the thing u want isn‚Äôt possible i think, custom api will work to initialize the mmr
yea it‚Äôs not possible
any new APIs need to be requested
Uh my mmr didn't change when we played only the others
Any clue why that might have happened?
Also only the ones with admin dosen't get their nickname changed to their mmr
How to fix that too?
U didn‚Äôt get mmr after voting?
you have the option to disable and enable mmr?
Everyone else has mmr other than me
And I have played 1 game
Do /stats
If it shows 100 mmr and 1 game it should be fine and the leaderboard could be bugging
Well I should have started with 100 mmr but ig smt bugged out
hmm could be
How do i fix the bug where when i pull up the leaderboard it does the "failed to load" thing
It only ever does it for MMR
Every other leaderboard stat works fine
Restarting app doesnt seem to work
What do you mean
Like /leaderboard of the type mmr?
you sure nobody changed the games count?
i can‚Äôt see this being possible
the losses and games are incremented at the same time
Im looking to set up 7 different ranks and keep an MMR value for players to use between all 7, as they go up it moves them up automatically. Only problem ive run into is the 7 queues that I set up seem to all have their own MMR
U can do /autoroles mmr set  and /rolerequirement for the queues to rank up and have the access between the different queues
I set all of that up, but it seemed like the MMR wasnt linking between all the queues. I made a control channel with the queue and reset it up with all 7 queues to have the same name and I think that might have worked but I havent testede it yet
Pretty sure since I run the server
I might have messed smt up with commands to idk
yup just name all the queues the same
Awesome, made sure I did this time. Thank you
Hi There is there away you can change the name of the teams or I‚Äôm I blind üôàüôàüôà
Any assistance would be appreciated üëåüëç
Could anyone help me out? The queue seems to be working fine, but the first message in every queue text channel is: 
```md
Permissions Error
Manage Channels
I am missing the Manage Channels permission, which I need to move and create channels!
Check my server permissions and any channel/role permission overrides!
Join the support server or /reportbug for help!
```
Thank you ü´∂
No problem üôÇ
Check the bots permissions and roles
Make sure the roles the bot has doesn‚Äôt override the neatqueue role
Or u can make a role and give it the same perms
Okies how do change the rest of the teams the same way ?
Wym? the rest
Only 2 that I know of.
I'm sure Don Soap or NeatZ can help better than I can though.
I‚Äôve managed to change one team name üôàüôà
Is there any way to make the every queue in a channel Captain-pick only?
I have no clue lmao
I‚Äôm currently  trailing the bot for COD community but I would like to have 3 teams as a recruitment team üëå and the rest for members to join cause this bot shows you Whois grouped up and shows there gamertag to which helps members add each other.
I'm new too but at the end of they day just play around a bit in a test server/channel and see what works and what doesn't.
Thank you for your assistance ü§õüëåüëç
No problem. üôÇ
<@648635725964902411> or <@145305657237700608>
As you can see on the information it shows how to change various team names
/teamselection
Ill ss
<@648635725964902411> this is what it does
you already tried to re-charge the leaderboard again with /leaderboard command?
hmm im not sure tbh, can be discord thing, you can always use the website
/ leaderboardconfig shorturl url:
Is there a way that I can have only specific members or roles play in a tournament? For example, an invitational event or league final where only players who were invited or had qualified are able to sign up or be added?
for the tempchannels it creates, how do I edit the permissions for those who can type in them?
/rolerequirement
My queue channels are locked from anyone typing in them, and then when it creates a temp channel those are also locked from anyone typing
Good to know.
Only people that joined that queue can type on them
U can add an spectator role if u want someone who didn‚Äôt join the queue to type
I don't think they were able to type
I'll check again
the buttons not working rn
They work
Mastered it thank you üëåüëç
<@145305657237700608> can u help me
whats up
I created a queue and it doesn't show me the queue
Idk if u get me
make sure the bot has perms to send messages
Just me or is the website not loading the dashboard for anyone else?
It has
If you‚Äôre not logged in it won‚Äôt show
says it does not
And i want it to be like this
Ah ok
Make sure the bot has perms on the mix channel since it has a lock on the name, could be overridding neatq perms
Oh yhea thx
<@648635725964902411> can i ask u something
we fixed it so where it makes a vc now but
everytime it keeps making new temp queues auto and dragging it like in 2 minutes it made 5 new ones for no reasson do yk how to fix that
when a match is cancelled it auto creates a new one?
not even match cancelled
while its the same
its jus spams new ones
u can try /requeue matchcancelled
and disable it
to see if that fixs it
bet ab do it rn
worked i think thanks lol we finally got it working
Good evening Guys üëã
I wonder if there was a way to disable the timer on the teams so it don‚Äôt kick erm out of  the team
what timer?
So if someone is in a team it kicks erm out for inactivity
/ timer afk toggle:False
<@145305657237700608> can u tell me what's the command to give points
Points or mmr?
Mmr is /add mmr
I can't understand this tbh
I want to give mmr to the winner team
And remove mmr from the loser team
That‚Äôs automatic
When u vote for the winner team
o/ I was wondering if anyone knew why players on the server I'm on still get kicked from the queue for inactivity even after using /timer afk Toggle: False? Would it have anything to do with them being offline on discord or tabbing out of discord? Thanks in advance!
Hmm not sure
Just try increasing the queue reset timer
Thing is, the queue isn't getting reset
I still have, say, 6 players in queue
but one gets kicked out for inactivity
The bot kicks them out of the queue?
Yeah
Like, right now, I have 7 people in queue
and one person keeps getting kicked out for inactivity
Only thing different from the rest is them having their discord set to offline
but like, that doesn't really matter no?
Shouldn‚Äôt be but im not sure
From what I know, he had his discord in the background while being on google
when he got kicked out
so far, having discord up normally hasn't kicked him out
NeatQueue doesn't have access to that data by design, so that wouldnt play a role at least
the AFK timer is reset however if you are interacting with a server that has NeatQueue, like sending a message, joining a channel, using buttons, etc
I figured that part out while testing things, but since I removed it I figured people not interacting would not get kicked out. Although, might there be a certain time before the command actually starts working? Found out that even if I get him to put his discord back in the background it doesn't kick him out anymore, despite it kicking him out for the first 10-ish minutes of me putting the afk timer to false.
if someone is in the queue before you disabled the command, they can still get afk kicked
ill fix that though
Aaaah, that must've been it.
Thanks a lot
how to make it so that only one queue can happen at a time.
we only have one server at a time, so is there anyway to prevent people from starting a 2nd queue?
no not really, the queue is emptied once the match is started
<@648635725964902411>i enabled voice channels on creation but it didnt work
voice channels still wont create
my other queues where i enabled it during /setup work just fine
but this one i didnt do voicechannels for then did commands to enable it
doesnt work
u checked perms?
are the voice channels not creating or you just mean the team voice channels
the team channels
<@648635725964902411>
U sure u have enabled /voicechannels teamchannels?
How do I get rid of this thing?
The mvp?
Just this whole embed
You can‚Äôt
You can try putting that msg on a private channel so no one can see it
With /resultschannel
Ok thanks
<@648635725964902411> how do I toggle to mvp?
just /mvp
<@189487132392292352> the ai is leading you astray
you can add a requeue delay
im so confused
what are you trying to do
alr, i wanna give server boosters and premium members priority in some form in queue
whether that be skipping queue lines, priority requeue...
is that possible ?
if you are using a default queue type that starts when it fills up, the best you can do is add a /requeue delay
and then give people a priority role to skip it
what commands would i need to do
/requeue delay 15 seconds
and then give requeue priority roles to @membership, @serverboosters
? any other values i need to change?
nope that would be it i think
Im just confsued because in /requeue priority theres a time and a value
that gives priority to people after requeuing
it‚Äôs the opposite of what you want
hmmm
what does this mean?
it‚Äôs an arbitrary number
but you can let some roles have higher priority
won‚Äôt matter in your setup
if the queuetype is Matchmaking, people with priority go to the front of the queue
is that all im guessing?
is higher the number higher priority? or lower number higher priority?
higher number is higher priority
is their a set up video i can watch that explains everything from the beginning to the end?
There‚Äôs documentation, it‚Äôs really good
debatable‚Ä¶
but yea i need to make some videos
i learned it all from there tbh
you are just an anomaly
i should try to get the AI to auto complete more info for docs
the AI isn‚Äôt great, but it does recite some good info sometimes
are their a way players can a register ? before they can queue
also the documentation where can i find that?
/ requireregister
Info about this channel
when i do the requireregister its asking mode? what does that mean? its for call of duty so how will i go about this?
what do you want to happen when they register?
when they do the / register it gives them the registered role i created
no other info needed, just using a command?
before they queue (if they are new to the server) they have to register and once they registered. the bot gives them the registered roles
The /register is to get mmr based on their elo on game
U can use a reaction bot role then and give the person that role
Then on your queue you do /role requirement
And select the role
NeatQueue has reaction roles built in
best bot üòé
Dats crazy
i can make a video with simple set up
takes 2 mins
that would be good because its alot for someone new and i am trying to have it setup for call of duty and im confused. im sure others would appreciate it as well for the same reasoning
i think there‚Äôs a vid but it‚Äôs filmed with a nokia and it was 2  years ago
lol i think i‚Äôve seen it
if you wanna make one sure, i need to make like a series
i only see 1 video on youtube and its not initial setup
<:thisisfine:1128496721052307456>
<@354789935666036736> ngl just /setup is your best friend
Hi I‚Äôm trying to set up neat que for R6s but I can‚Äôt set it up using Ubisoft Connect names as it doesn‚Äôt work. Is there any way I can do something like /register and people put in there gamertag and then they can start Queing and then i report the winners and losers and elo is distributed
The rest just find by reading commands
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> i think theres a bug/glitch where if you dont do the voice channels during setup you cant get them
Like the command doesnt work
Ive tried enabling it alot of times
Different days
Just wont work
It works fine for me
/requireregister and selection Rainbow 6 doesn‚Äôt work?
Yh cos no one knows their Ubisoft Connect name. Would be so much easier to just use their platform gamertags. /register Jynxzi for example
Then they are registered for games under their gamertag
And their server name is the same as their gamertag
<@648635725964902411>
Hmmm
Require register it‚Äôs actually to get their elo
If u just want nametags u can do /ign
`/requireign`
Why do you need their in game elo? I just wanna do a server elo I don‚Äôt want their in game rank to have anything to do with it
thats the difference between /register and /ign, /register will initialize a players MMR
/ign will just set their IGN
Yh but only admins can do it I want ppl to set their own names and only be able to do it once
/ign is a user command
/ set ign is the admin one
Is to change someones ign
With admin perms yk
For /register what do I need?
Game account u set to register
For example if it‚Äôs valorant, its like Name#1234
What do u mean game account? Can people register under their server name?
Or discord username?
their actual valorant account
is there a way to give a role to users if they are currently a captain?
/captains role
I thought that was just the role for users who get priority for captain. 
I was wanting for players who are chosen as captains to receive a temp role that lets them see a channel that has an embed list of servers and their availability to choose from.
oh wait
Yeah it‚Äôs a priority never mind
I don‚Äôt think what u wanna do is possible
As far as an embed list of servers and stuff, that was going to be a seperate thing I develop later on. 
I was just hoping that a temp captain role was something I could set in neatqueue
how do i set up how much MMR you get per win and how much you lose per lost and how much MVP MMR you get?
/mmr change set, if u want that in every game the win is x mmr and the loser gets x mmr no matter what put Static on true
Mvp reward is /mvp reward
i did enable for team vcs
and it just doesnt work
you might have `/voicechannels mode Disabled`?
i think he already set them enabled, i told him yesterday
are u sure they are not creating at the top of the server or something like that, or doesnt even create the queue voice channel
what is the command to delete queues
first /resetstats all in the queue then `/endqueue`
it doesnt even create the queue voice channel
im trying making it forced vc join then back to optional to see if it fixes it
it made the vcs for forced
havent queued since i made it optional now
Nope it didnt work
It only makes vc's when i put it on required
whats ur config /save
Gimme a sec
Gotchu
PREUO <@145305657237700608>
looks like a bug, if there isnt a lobby voice channel, it won't continue to the team channels
ill update in a bit
<@145305657237700608> just ping me when you do
And thanks
it only occurs cuz of the queue type you have
no team setup = no "Queue" lobby voice channel
Idk what that means
in your queue, you pick your team when you join
so there is no need for a voice channel to setup teams in
Anyone know how or can help setting up a Cod 8s bot with stuff like Captain Choice, best of 3 or 5 etc
Do /setup
That makes sense
And no voice channel for team setup=no team voice channels
Gotta love the specifics of coding
<:TE_Shrug:856060385433616384>
fixed
Say you have 3 different servers people can play on, queue 1 is playing on server 2 and queue 2 pops, how could players from queue 2 know that server 2 is used and they should head to server 1 or 3? Would there be a way to add an option/is there an option for the players in a queue to pick the server they're going on so that players in the next queue have said server no longer available to be picked?
Don‚Äôt think so
Crosschat would do something but is not automatic, it‚Äôs just text between servers
i wonder what happens if you start a queue in a crosschat ...
hmmmm
never tried crosschat tbh <:thisisfine:1128496721052307456>
My bad, point may have been written a bit wrong. What I meant by 3 different servers were different servers on the game, not discord.
I was thinking, since you could vote for maps for example, could you do the same for game servers?
Actually, I guess you could, but it wouldn't show up as taken in the other queue's chat, right?
U can do a vote for game server adding a new voting menu with /votingmenu add, but it won‚Äôt show that is taken
Hi, do you know how I can setup a schedule for the queue??
Hmm u can lock the queue and open it at a certain time, and close it again with /lock and /unlock
That‚Äôs work, thanks <@648635725964902411>
can someone help on this queue bot, once the queue filled up and made the new channel, it wont show how to pick captains or how to pick team
For some reason  this does not work in our discord.  "/player sub player1:@(P2) Rose player2:@btc"             (I always get the error  No matches with @(P2) Rose - (967) found!)
channel is just empty?
is Rose in a match in  that channel?
nvm this bot was just a updated version than what i am used to
is there a way to not force the people in the queue to not join the vc
to start picking captains
`/voicechannel mode`
is there a way to always make the captains by voting
who the captains will be?
`/captains selection`
well... then the error message is valid
so how do you sub a player who is qued but not in the channel.  Lets say Rose is qued and not here, How do you replace Rose to James.
you must type the sub command in the respective match channel
anybody know the command to display mmr next to your name in discord?
/ratinginname
it still isnt showing the number next to our names
how can i change the prefix of the lobby?
i dont know how to change it
ive got an config with an lobby prefix like this: PSO br 1,2,3,etc
and i want a prefix like this:  PSO FUTSAL 1,2,3,etc
`/tempchannels name`
so for you, set to: PSO FUTSAL $
thank u very much for the support
i think that i didnt explained that good
look
i want to change this lobby prefix
it actually says Lobby Name: **PSO br**
oh, that would be `/lobbydetails set`
check out https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=usage-lobbydetails-set-message for more info and possibilities
hi may i ask how do i add someone as admind
so he can see the matches and stuffs like that as well
In a 2v2 matchmaking queue, it can go over 4 players normally, but when I try to queue with a party of 2, it wont let me queue when it's 3 people in queue, is there any way to fix that?
On pugs that‚Äôs not possible
Do you have your queue type on mm or pugs
that's why im confused on it not working
Did u enable the parties
yeah!
parties can normally join
but if it's 3 people in the queue it doesn't let them
What does it say
/staffrole add
oke thankyou
looks like it doesn't skip that check for matchmaking, will fix
TYSM <3

Also if there‚Äôs a dodge penalty the mmr can go below the floor too, another glitch I found
makes sense, will fix as well
how to show the mmr next to discord name?
in the leaderboard?
`/ratinginname`
like this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1133848915502956686/1134502456794030110/Screenshot_2023-07-28_at_10.07.30_AM.png
i tried doing the ratinginname but idk the format
Same
use the default, which is like the picture
just type it word for word?
you dont even need to touch the format command
bruh
/ratinginname toggle ?
ok it says player's rating will be added when they queue
whatd be the eta on that?
ill push out the update in a few mins
is there any way to remove ties from leaderboard
i disabled tieing but the 1 tie is still on leaderboard
and the games deleted so i cant revert it
ties wont show if they are disabled
what is the discord bot coded in
python
so cool
it just took like 5 mins to update
its done
attempting to delete a leaderboard that is unused, "pug" with /endqueue but I realized endqueue doesn't specify which queue to end/delete. Any other way to remove this from the listings?
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1132755613982654505/1134568355915890808/image.png
I haven't previously had to delete a queue but they want to remove it
u have to do /endqueue on the channel the queue is
(do this) /resetstats all for that queue that is unused and it will dissapear from the options
heard, appreciate it <@648635725964902411>
is it possible to transfer the bot from one server to another after i bought a month plan?
sure just LMK the server IDs and ill transfer credits
is there a way to make the bot kick people out of queue if inactive or in the queue for too long
it actually has a kick by default
every 60 minutes it kicks everyone from the queue
u can modify the timer by `/timer afk`
is there any reason i cant get captains pick to work anymore when doing draft?
i'm not sure what happened but it doesn't come up for us anymore
checkout `/teamselection` and `/captains selection`
thank you!
dmd them to you
anybody know the command to make the bot automatically make this in a channel
/staffchannel
What is the upper limit for leaderboard image refreshing before discord rate limits it? The leaderboard was working just fine but it seems that as we approached about 100 matches today it is in the infinite refresh loop
I switched it over to text for now and it's doing good, but maybe we'll just refresh it less or somethin'
Discord it‚Äôs so shet for leadearboards
The best option is the web one
nah I know its discord, but is there like, an observed limit of "40 refreshes" a day or something?
dumb low rate limits tho smh
Shouldn‚Äôt be
not neatqueue fault
alright alright, appreciate it
It for sure has per minutes and days, but it shouldn‚Äôt be 40 refreshes for sure, they can handle 50 request per second i think
i think the message update limit is like 1 per 3 seconds or something?
you shouldn‚Äôt hit any infinite refresh loop
but yea obviously website leaderboard is best since it‚Äôs client side updates and requests for data are cached temporarily
hi, how is it??
i want 2 gk and 6 players
cuz one team has 1 gk and 3 players
how can i do?
<@145305657237700608> is it possible for you to look into this
From my knowledge I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible
you can do /roles
GK,Player,Player
since the update it keeps making a solo queue get added onto their team üò≠
not sure what's going wrong
it happened 3 queues in a row so it's not just a one time thing
is it 2v2?
yeah
<@145305657237700608>
hmm ok i‚Äôll check it out
matchmaking with parties seems to be messed up
i think it just isnt checking if the 4th player in queue is in a party, so it makes the game queue with the first 4, and the 5th is in the party with the 4th so they also get added in ?
how to make that appear more detailed?
back to the individual stats, I'm missing the setting for it
/winnermessage format
Excuse my ignorance, still learning. When a queue starts, are players barred from joining the queue again while one match is running? I can test this later but was curious now.

Also, is there a way to block a players from joining a queue again or locking it while a match is in progress? Ideally I want players in an active match not able to requeue until after the match is over, allowing players who want to join the next one to be allowed first grabs. Then after submitting the result, they may join again.
Thanks again for your help yesterday <@271014487451107329>. Everything worked real well, and I added images for all the maps. Let me know if you want the config or links to images.
If a player is in a match, the bot won‚Äôt let the player join a queue until his game is completed üëçüèª
Awesome! Thanks for that. That's what I needed to know.
Also theres /requeue if u want to delay timer for players to queue again
I'll check that out, I think I may have already changed that. I do have one other thing I noticed.
If I click revert and press the same result again I get two different results, and it continues to change or sometimes stay the same. Is that normal or am I missing something?
awesome üôÇ Glad its workin brother
its due to the streak multiplier, the initial calculation may reset the streak, and that info is lost
its kinda hard to fix, cuz you could change a result for an old match, which would change the streak multiplier for every match after... so not really gonna fix
i would disable parties, it was never implemented with matchmaking so its all mysterious behavior
Okay, that's good to know. Thank you. It's not a terrible need since MMR is tracked seperately and I'm going to create a plugin or extension for CS2 later on. Right now I'm planning to use the API for CS:GO to track when a match ends and to update the status of the results page after x seconds to give some players time to alt tab and re-queue. Just wanted to know what I was missing from clicking and unclicking it and then back again.
building a plugin for csgo would be super cool, should be pretty achievable using the API and webhooks too
yeah, have it disabled for now, but would love a fix
for sure, thatll should be a priority fix
If you have any interested I can provide to you, but not sure how relevant it will be since CS2 will be coming out soon. If they keep both versions it can certainly be more fleshed out.
But once CS2 is out I will look at what methods of integration are available.
i would for sure be interested in what it looks like
its possible
look
i got it on another mix
but i want to change that "linha
this button doesnt work
how can i change who can use /leaderboard?
without giving al commands permission
eta on that?
/leaderboardconfig edits
not very soon, it‚Äôs not the easiest fix
maybe this week
alr!
ty for the update
Why is it that we can solo join queue even if it's at like 20/12, but when you're in a party queue of 2 (what we tried) it says we have too many players to join queue?
is this matchmaking or pugs?
pugs
hmm okay another issue with parties
We have our server set up so that it allows for overfill and then a mod manually /forcestart to get a match going
my name green now
but yeah parties work (we capped it at 2, duo queue max) but when its at the overfill (eg. 20/12) they are unable to join, gives them an error saying party was too big to queue
yea there are validations that happen to make sure the party can fit in the match, but that doesn‚Äôt apply the same way with over filling
is there something I can do to allow parties to join when queue is in overfill?
not right now
Ok I discovered what the real issue with this was (follow thread for refresher)

It turns out I can link multiple queues to one channel, and I can view the leaderboard for each individually, but the bot displays the wrong title on the response.

So I linked 2v2 and 8v8, I did /leaderboard and did 2v2 under queue name, and it correctly displayed the 2v2 leaderboard, but the title was 8v8 leaderboard. 8v8 was the queue I had linked most recently
In short, /leaderboard (queue name) shows the correct leaderboard, but titles it as the most recent linked queue, not the correct title of the leaderboard
a channel can only be linked to one queue
but yes, the command shows the right data, with the wrong name
That's not what you said before, and it's not true based on what I just did
if you are in a non queue channel and use /link to multiple queues, it will keep overwriting the last link
I can successfully view all 5 queues linked in one channel. It just doesn't display the title correctly, which isn't the end of the world
yea, that‚Äôs not a /link thing
Before I did /link, I couldn't view any leaderboards
yea, if the channel isn‚Äôt a queue or linked, you can‚Äôt use any queue related commands
Yes I know
So I linked it to 5 different queues
And I can see all 5 leaderboards
once a channel is linked, you can view any leaderboard data via /leaderboard
doesn‚Äôt matter what it‚Äôs linked to
I see
but yea i need to figure out a better solution for viewing leaderboards, you shouldn‚Äôt need a queue linked
I didn't have complete data on my leaderboards so I was just going off the title. Now that I know it's different leaderboards I'm not worried about it
I apologize too because you said exactly that but I didn't understand without my data
easiest solution is to not rely on specifying the queuename in /leaderboard for now
and no worries
NQ bot isn't respecting the results channel. I'll set it up, it'll be working and then it'll just start sending results in the queue channel again (even after setting it)
<:pepeWhy:970054408568197160>
weird
<:thisisfine:1128496721052307456>
putting results channel ID instead made it work again
did you set the channel with a game in progress? cuz that wouldn‚Äôt obey the new setting
that would do it
BRO HOW DO U TURN OFF ROLE DMS üò≠
What roles
Is there a way to pull the leaderboard from a server's queue system onto excel?
you can use the API, but it won‚Äôt format nicely in excel since it‚Äôs nested json
the /api/leaderboard/{server_id}/{channel_id} ? Which channel would the channelid have to match to? The queue channel?
I would say so
awesome, thank you, I was able to get it imported to google sheets and managed to get the data into a properly formatted table
autorole dms
how do u turn it off
^ and then another seperate issue
Is there a way to disable some of the pop ups that show during ques without having to run the disable command every time? I am trying to turn off the voting system and just make it show teams with players
/teamselection
there is no option for that currently
they must‚Äôve got reset?
hi may i ask
why my q doesnt appear at the bottom anymore
<@145305657237700608> üò≠
https://getrekt.cc/sHFaCF.png
I would like to create two options to enter. one as a goalkeeper and one as a player
@donor
/roles
I'm talking about two options to enter here
yeah, u do that with /roles
ah ok ,and how do i change the queue size
`/teamsize`
so it goes to two I want to change only one
what do you wanna do?
change the size of a team
this command goes to both
<@648635725964902411>
i dont understand what you trying to achieve if im honest
u can change teamsize on that type of queue like that
I want to change the size of only one team
u want to do 2 gk and 4 players?
ok do `/teamsize size:1` and then do `/roles roles:GK, LINHA, LINHA, LINHA, LINHA`
How can I set increased MMR for winstreaks for every player?
how to remove the configuration that when it starts you need to join the call
change the /voicechannels mode
Guys there is someone who can help me here?
how do i generate a password when starting a match
<@648635725964902411>
That‚Äôs not an option
you can do it via /lobbydetails
Wait it is
What
yea https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobbydetails-set
Oh I thought like a private queue or some thing like that
my bad
cant know it all <:TE_FeelsOkayMan:729339549188096040>
Can‚Äôt recollect all info in 1 month
i really thought üòî
I have leaderboard config settings to rolling but now there's only 3 people on the leaderboard and everyone's mmr is lower but not reset
I checked the logs and no one changed anything
how do I fix this?
one person's stats didn't change at all but they're the only one
Won‚Äôt appear on lb if the person has 0 games
wdym mmr is lower
like reset? or what
the first one is july and the second one is august
one person was completely unaffected by this
everyone else was completely removed from the leaderboard, or had their stats randomly changed by a lot
I'm assuming if leaderboard config settings were set to resetting it would reset everyone entirely instead of this
first thing, people won‚Äôt show on the new months leaderboard until they queue again
i wonder if there was a match that started in July, and ended in August?
the last match started at 4:49 pdt and ended at 4:50 pdt
is this the second month?
it's still july for everyone in the server though
I'm trying to pull the History from the api (/api/history/{server_id}
But I'm getting this output:
> 10:43:53‚ÄØPM    Notice    Execution started
> 10:43:53‚ÄØPM    Info    Error fetching history data. Status code: 403
> 10:43:53‚ÄØPM    Info    Response content: {"detail":"Forbidden"}
> 10:43:54‚ÄØPM    Notice    Execution completed
How do I obtain access to this?
did you include an API token?
Do I need the server-specific api token to obtain that? For the leaderboard pull I didn't.
leaderboard data is public (it‚Äôs all available on the website anyways)
https://api.neatqueue.com should indicate which endpoints are secured
what‚Äôs the url hold on
https://api.neatqueue.com/docs
gotcha, I didn't even think about how there were unlock symbols next to certain api calls
https://api.neatqueue.com/docs#/
yep exactly
is the api key set by serverowner/admin per discord? or pre-made per server?
and what route is needed to obtain it?
it‚Äôs just per account
use /webhooks generatetoken
gotcha, appreciate it üôÇ
is there anything I can do about my situation?
the bot sees it as august currently
yes, but the stats shouldn't have changed
i‚Äôll take a look in a bit and see why your data doesn‚Äôt line up perfectly
thank you
no matches in the past 3 hours?
no, the last match was just over 3 hours ago
which server?
it's called DSNA OW2
something strange happened it seems, i‚Äôll have to investigate more, seems like the stats copied over from like July 26th
if you want you can manually copy the stats from July into August
any new data for august would be lost though
how can I do that?
I tried to do that but it didn't work
`/migratestats old_name:2023-07_Doom Sumo new_name:2023-08_Doom Sumo`
Hey NeatZ, so I noticed that you have to login to the neatqueue api site to authorize data pulls; However, how could I do a login through script that does the api pull?
would i do this via oauth2 or service account? -im new to api pulls requiring authentication outside a simple apiKey= line
all you need is the api token in the auth header
should be pretty simple
any chance you have an example auth header?
the command didn't work, the august leaderboard is still wrong
nvm it works now, thanks
it‚Äôs just a request header, named ‚ÄúAuthorization‚Äù
sometimes auto role just doesnt work??
reset countless times almost, redoing every role
in stats it doesnt say rank up derank etiher
How do I add different gamemode to choose from?
/votingmenu add
unless you are using maps, just use /map add
what does your /info look like for autoroles
See message private bro
you don‚Äôt need to DM me and @ me in here
just ask a question

I want maps in a cell alone
I want maps in a cell alone
I would like someone to solve this problem <@145305657237700608>
that‚Äôs not possible
cuz it‚Äôs not
it‚Äôs not a thing
<@145305657237700608> Can you add another draft type for /captains draftype. A hybrid 3 option (we use 6 players on a team in this game) so ideally it would be 1-1-1-2-1
That would help us balance the teams quite a bit more because our first picks are really strong while our last picks are quite weak right now in this small community.
Also any functionality around which captain gets to pick first would be nice. Right now, it's the lowest MMR which is OK but the MMR is not totally accurate for us. Having the ability to vote for which captain should be able to pick first would be nice. We noticed Team 1 wins at a lot higher percentage than Team 2 using the straight method
How do I make the "Inactive players will be removed in 5 minutes!" Shorter?
/lobbychannel timer
how do I make roles for different mmrs?
<@&1062227848607322172> Below 1000 MMR

Do you know how I can reset all data in leaderboards?
How do I stop the bot spamming peoples DMs?
You‚Äôll need to reset everyones stats
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to disable it?
I would guess there‚Äôs no option
no option
people can block the bot if they want
When I blocked the bot myself, I end up not seeing the messages and have to click to open the ranked queue and then the teams etc. I don‚Äôt find it a huge deal so I‚Äôd  have the bot unblocked but I find it unnecessary to have the bot dming a person every single time the lose/gain a rank.
I think it is working now, their info looks okay, one sec
https://getrekt.cc/w3SrqE.png
ill check out adding an option to disable
Thank you, it is nothing urgent or nothing that *must* be changed, but I think it is a little tweak you should add to improve the quality of life for players.
<@145305657237700608> I figured that this exists in DMs
I‚Äôm so dumb
I thought you can only block
ill add it anyways
not sure if I'm just missing it in the documentation - is there a way for points to be awarded for tie games?
ie - 
+22 for win
+10 for tie
-20 for loss
no actually, that‚Äôs not a thing
nobody has requested that yet
copy that, I shall formally request
we did all the roles 1 by 1
j auto deleted ig
did you copy to other queues, then delete some roles?
j did it again
nah bot was j glitching ig
the auto role stuff j smtimes doesnt work
we set everything 1 by 1 and it still fucks up
that screenshot is the same queue?
we just auto refresehed everyone's role
and then every role showed up on /info
I‚Äôm having an issue with Auto Unlock and auto lock, I run the command and it simply just doesn‚Äôt work
Both of them /\ repeat is set to true
i need to add this bot for my server and setup this bot in my server
any else can help me/
Add the bot to your server
And do /setup
i do it this step
i need the setup for crossfire
can you help me
Do /setup and it will guide you
can  you come to setup it?
cross fire is similar to a lot of other games that are in <#1068605714098049054>  I would use something like the valorant config to get yourself started and then modify it as you need if you don't want to start from scratch
Read what it is telling you, it says a queue already exists and giving you a command to reset it "/endqueue"
you mean i take a code of valo
it similar to cross fire?
i need code to do similar of this
can any else help me?
<@271014487451107329>

Just follow what it says
i dont understand
please help me
if you can help me
come it`s 5 mins
nobody knows what you want lmao
run /setup and follow what it says
change the /language if you need
i want to setup this bot for scrims in crossfire
<:monkaW:976227202918133841>
yes, you want to setup, then do /setup
no arabic in this bot
ill try adding it
One question, do you know why all users that enter to the channels created are force to use Push to Talk?
that would be due to your Category's permissions i assume
yeah autorolls r just broken <@271014487451107329>
did /info all there
and then
NOTHING
people get their roles removed but no new role when they reach a certain mmr thresh
whats the channel ID
For the queue?
1132753848629461165
i havent heard of this issue
<@189487132392292352> im cross comparing all the roles in that server vs all the auto roles set up, and im only seeing 6 matches
MMR auto roles
wtfffff
my friend protocol went through EVERY single one
and addedit
i dont know <:Shruge:1094709244839862302> literally resassigned every role already
are you using `/autoroles copy` by chance?
I've verified the roles have been added properly myself, we didn't copy them over or anything. We fully removed the role and re-added it a few times
Have auto roles been used en mass like this?
When I run info, this is what I get
https://getrekt.cc/uwMvHu.png
shouldn‚Äôt be any issue with it
that‚Äôs the same channel ID?
reminds me to switch that Embed so it can display more
for  /autoroles mmr set, does only-one-allowed apply to all queues
I have an 8v8 queue, 7v7, 4v4, 3v3, and 2v2, and I have roles for each. I don't want them to have 8v8 diamond and 8v8 platinum, but I do want them to be able to have 8v8 diamond and 7v7 diamond
Same one yeah. I'm gonna try something on my end and see if I can fix it via config again
I'll let you know
I figured it out.

Now, for tournaments, am I able to make the tournaments affect mmr? I'm running a 2v2 tournament and would like it to count towards the 2v2 queue mmr
<@145305657237700608>
<@857633321064595466> any update on the Party Queue fix?
That command does not exist!
<@145305657237700608> **
are you scheduling a time?
./unlock all:True auto_unlock:True time:17:00 timezone:UTC repeat:True
./lock all:True auto_lock:True time:21:00 timezone:UTC repeat:True
I run both of those commands
it works for me, i just tried by locking at 14:02
ill check it out today
Appreciate it <3
is there a reason that the bot doesnt respond to /setup ??
only reason would be if it doesnt have perms to send messages
it just says starting que setup and does nothing after that but It has all the perms it should.. that I know of
it does not have perms to send messages
it says
auto role just gets rid of roles and adds more than 1 role
sometimes it works how its intended
could you possibily join the sersver and take a look ?
sure
adds more than 1 role?
yes check dms rq
like i dont think a queue was ever going on
at 9:52
if you changed a setting that would update your role
i dont think anyone changed anything at 10am
purifyy ran a refresh
yes if the tournament matches the normal queue system's name
can you give me perms to type in the queue channel so i can check the info
we can hop on a call in a bit if you want, the queue channel with ID=1132753848629461165 looks like it has a bunch of autoroles for IDs that are not valid
yh join private
i can in like 40 mins
nvm im free now
Yeah it doesn‚Äôt do both
At one point it didn‚Äôt unlock but it locked at the set time
webhooks not letting me delete em?
https://getrekt.cc/tL4H48.png
<:kittenThinking:727233046234791976>
just a temp issue?
uhh try again?
yeah, oh well. That worked
delete deletes all I think? Cause I just added in the other webhook I wanted to use
its queue specific, and a queue can only have 1 webhook currently
heard okay, so I inadvertently worked around not being able to delete it by just adding another and it overwrote my last one. Cool, cool
np, what u building, or is it top secret <a:Eyes:1015273749114798090>
If interested I'll show you the bot after I'm all done, I redid it all and scrapped using python for discord js and its all in a docker container for ezpz deploy
LOL I was typing it out as you sent that
yeah I'll show u once it's working lmao
for sure im interested to see
oh I just realized, I made a test server for the bot to test webhooks and stuff (like see what the json is that gets sent over during events) and so I disabled matchoutcome, but does the channel just stay there forever? There isn't a button or anything to click to say "match complete"
it‚Äôll delete after the voice channels are emptied usually
or after the cleanup timer
i disabled voice channels too so I guess its cleanup timer xD
all good, super edge case because i just wanted bot to do things with me clicking minimally
also more of a request, is it possible to include channel id for the created queue channel in the json? I guess it kinda makes sense its not in there right, because you *can* disable the temp text channel
unless this is supposed to be populated with that?
https://getrekt.cc/ONByTo.png
im just guessing on that one, i can infer what the rest of the types are for
for now I'll just monitor the on_guild_chanel_create event for a text channel named "#queue-xxx"
i thought it was in there
the lobby details is for /lobbydetails
whatever info you need just LMK and i‚Äôll add it
for sure, so this is the json I get on match started, it is mostly all the info needed -- in fact I could infer the queue channel name because the queue number is in there:
https://getrekt.cc/lWhpTZ.png
And then this is join queue, and it includes channel at the top -- but that channel isn't the queue channel ID from what I can tell
https://getrekt.cc/X7FMCf.png
That is the ID of the channel where the "join queue" embed lives
for that game, the temp queue channel ID was: 1136794679527079996
ok let me add it
anything else besides the channel id
not that I can think of
one sec
nah nothing else that I need afaik
I have manage channel permission enabled and it makes a new chat chanel for the captain pick and ect. But after it says it doesnt have the perm.. any help?
when does it say it doesnt have perm?
In the channel?
yeah so after it makes the chanel for the que to vote on stuff it says it cant after I confirm teams
check the category perms
I dont see that anywhere
the permissions for the category
gotcha.. Thanks again!
Do you know how i can remove roles from match voices channels, to only permit the users in party?
did you add a spectator role?
I add mode roles, and requiered rol. Then y remove the required rol, but thid didn't remove the rules from voice channels
what?
im not sure what we are talking about, which commands
rolerequirement add
Then I remove the role, but this still adding the role in the voices channels, so all players can enter in the match voice channel
that command wouldnt have any effect on entering voice channels
its only a check when joining queue
How i can remove the rol from the voice channels???
if its not a spectator role or staff role, then you mustve added it in your Category permissions
hi can we delete a specific mmr of a month in leaderboard
you mean the mmr won in a specific month?
<@145305657237700608> sorry for tagging you so much but it‚Äôs still not working
is there a way to disable kicking people from voice channels, we are pretty chill in our pugs and whenever someone who isn't in the pug joins the voice channel it kicks everyone from all voice channels?
we do not want to lock the voice channels
i see spectator is a thing too, could i just give everyone in my server spectator or so?
whats the channel?
are you talking about the 5 minute countdown?
also if you dont want to lock channels disable `/channel restrictions`
no so we have channels unlocked but every time someone who isn't in the queue joins the channel, once the match has been voted and finished, it kicks everyone from every voice channel
and no not the 5 minute countdown
Once the match is finished it will delete all the channels
Since it‚Äôs finished
see the thing is, if a person who isn't in the pug doesn't join, it moves everyone back to the pug lobby just fine
If the match is finished it won‚Äôt move them to the lobby channel again?
it does, but what im saying is this 
1. a pug starts everybody joins/is moved to the queue channel
2. everybody is moved/joins
3. the team channels are made and everyone is moved
4. i am not in the queue but i join to spectate and chat and so on
5. once the game is finished we vote for the winner and then everyone is kicked from every voice channel

the problem here is that if i dont join the team channel no kicking happens
i'd like to be able to join or for others to join
usually if i dont join the channel everyone is moved back to the lobby channel just fine
actually i have an idea, could i send my config code and maybe that will help?
Sure
U just don‚Äôt want kicking things? im kinda lost lol
hmmmm
ill send my config code but yeah, just no kicking from voice channels period
XRKCX
i could vc if you need more info but yeah
yeah sorry if this is a bit complex but basically we're just after a simple 4v4, map vote, with captains and balanced, voice required but allow people to join with a lobby channel people join as the queue starts
Ok you say everyone gets kicked or moved when a match finishes?
you want people to join a channel even if they aren‚Äôt in queue, that‚Äôs already set by unlocking the channels mode, it shouldn‚Äôt kick them if u join
And as i see by lobby info, you move everyone from all the channels, is that correct
Wdym sorry
Channel name or id
yeah the problem is once the game finishes, EVERYONE in the current voice channels are kicked
yea once the match is done, the channels are cleaned up
if you dont want that, you can just create permanent team channels
alright yeah
cool i gotcha
ill look into that
1129056123111100568
looks like repeat is off?
Repeat has defo been on, I‚Äôve had to manually run the commands over the last couple days
I‚Äôll rerun them real quick
Just rerun them <@145305657237700608>
Yeah, just create permanent ones
U can disable the temp channels
ill test it and let you know how we go
U can either disable all temp channels
Or just the team ones
`/tempchannels toggle` for all and `/voicechannels teamchannels` for team ones
I would like to know how I can make 2 channels, when I duplicate a channel the error in the commands of the other
<@145305657237700608>
im not sure what you are asking
<@145305657237700608> I ran them with it defo set to true and the queue did not open at the intended time
seems it might be an issue with having a lock + unlock scheduled, it will only do whatever was most recently set
hey guys, how's the bot calc elo differences?
why does joey get less elo than me for example since i am higher
placement + streak multiplier
placement meaning when they were picked?
no their first 10 placement matches
get extra multiplier boost
i didn't know that
thank you
My server got nuked, is there anyway to reload the config of the last queue even if i didnt /save?
did u delete the server?
no he just deleted the queue channel
do you remember the name of the queue?
roughly
it should be FPL-D
whats the id of your sever
if you never ran /save then the config would not be saved at all, and when the channel is deleted the queue is deleted too
I think I ran it a couple versions back
ill have to rebuild then
thank you
i can check for any previous versions
in a little bit
what is mmr change variance
basically how much mmr you can win per match or lose depending on the other ones mmr
Is there any way to do both?
i used the sticky commad enable but it doesnt drop down the q
bruh we started a new q and it got bugged and stuck again
is there anything wrong
Shouldn‚Äôt be a problem
whats the command to set the voice channels for teams
i have two voice channels made, how do i assign them
that is not supported
the team channels aren't assigned, they are created by the bot usually
<@145305657237700608> update on party queue?
been working on it, really complicates stuff lol
yeah the problem then is once the game finishes EVERYONE is kicked from the channels and not moved back to the lobby channel
i know the voice channels get deleted but i have temporary channels disabled so i dont get it
you are saying you have team voice channels disabled, but it still kicks everyone?
also if you want people returned to the lobby channel, use `/lobbychannel return`
I saw ur config yesterday
It‚Äôs wrong
You have enabled pull all from all the channels, you should have that disabled
And did you set a lobby channel?
yeah i do have one
true ill try test it without that, thing is i do want it to pull and return the players
that will only work with the temporary voice channels
doesn't seem to be though, it just kicks them
But kicks them from where
Help?
what happen if u vote again
it may bugged out
I can't
Its other 2 players
I'm just an Admin
hmm do /outcome select winner this time if u can, maybe it bugged for this game
if u see it keep happening u can do /save, end the queue and load it again
to see if it fixes
Ight well the outcome didnt work so I'm thinking the entire thing is bugged
hmm weird
I told the guys to vote again because ending the queue did not work either
Ok the revote worked thankfully
is there anyway to set the permissions up for the specified category when a queue is popped and only those players can see it
Like it doesn't let people who are in the queue type in the match chat
That must be your category settings
ahhh
How do I set it to change exactly the same every time, no matter what the mmr difference is
You gotta put static to true
on /mmr change set
how to make your queues 24/7
Is there a way to only have the queue open between 2 certain times
The queues are 24/7
An unexpected error occurred in the Queue when matching. I would be happy if you could address this.
Error code: FGVZB
looks like an issue with a voting menu you added, i‚Äôll check why
The queue lock and autolock is the only way
Been over that it doesn‚Äôt work already
i know
But it‚Äôs the only way
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/868549627652214794/1137122016554659991
So you can‚Äôt then?
He will try to fix it
But he has to fix a lot of other bugs tho
i‚Äôll probably move all my party queue changes to a different branch so i can push out all the other updates
The bot has been kicking people from discord instead of splitting the teams up. Do you guys know why?
U modified any perms?, or any team settings?
Check you have enabled /voicechannels teamchannels
i probably need to restart the bot
Settings have been the same for around 2 weeks
how do i remove this, i want to put it only for captains to choose
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608>
I wanted to choose the captains option directly
no need to vote
`/teamselection`
Does it still kicking people
Is there per role mmr? If so how do i set it up? Similiar to overwatch, support has different mmr than dps.. etc
Don‚Äôt think so
<@145305657237700608> Just shooting in the dark here, any way to start a match via another bot or application if queue's are set to only start when an admin does /forcestart? Like for example, an API post request that basically executes the /forcestart command? Via API it looks like I could lock and unlock queue but not force start a queue
This is what the usage is in my mind. We have 3 available custom servers are our disposal. If all 3 are currently being used, my bot will hold the queue until one becomes available. Once one is, it will /forcestart the queue and then everything proceeds as normal
Bot can‚Äôt run other bot commands with slashes i think
i could add it to the API
Is there a way to get the bot to move people from a specific voice channel into different temp team channels? I want the voice channel to be the main one everyone uses when they join our discord, aka "Chill" channel. Once the queue is started and the teams are selected I want them to be moved into the Team 1 and Team 2 calls. What the bot is currently doing is making a new text and voice channel for the queue, and everyone must join that channel in order for the match to start and for it to automatically move everyone to their team chats.
yeah, that would be the other option
if you have access to servers we can set up something cooler
i currently have an available integration where the bot can manage servers for you
<a:think3D:684191716877795361>  oh yeah?
it will pick a free one, tag it as used, then free it up after the match
NAH OKAY GET IN MY DMS U HOT PERSON
I set it up for a different game that used NeatQueue before they had matchmaking implemented, so when teams are setup, it will do a region vote, fetch an open server, then send lobby details on how to connect
that so sick??
U can‚Äôt delete the queue voice channel and then split teams
you can put vc to optional if you want, so everyone won‚Äôt need to join the vc to start, then the teams are created but it won‚Äôt move the users that aren‚Äôt in the queue channel
They will need to join by themselves
Ok, so there is no way to make an existing voice channel work as the Queue voice channel?
I mean its not a big deal, just thought it would be convenient if it would just automatically drag the teams into 2 different calls by itself from the VC we chill in.
You can make it that everyone on your chill vc will be automatically moved into the queue vc
Oh how do I do that?
/lobbychannel set
Put your chill vc as lobby
I did that earlier, and I did a test run and it doesn't move us from the designated lobby to the queue vc
Should I use the queue start command in the VC's text channel? maybe thats why
what do you mean
It doesn‚Äôt matter
Could you send me your queue config to see if it works for me
Do you mean the channel config? or are you talking about the "/setup" I did with the bot?
I've been changing a lot of settings trying to customize it to the server, and I don't remember all of the ones I changed lol
I've been testing by using "/startqueue" with a test name, team size of 1, and 2 teams.
Just do /save
And send me the code
Queue configuration saved as: RAAQG
I see why if you set a lobby channel they won‚Äôt get dragged
You have your voicechannels set to Optional
Set your voice channels to Required
and it will be fixed
Also do /requeue matchcancelled and disable it
Also you should enable the /tempchannels toggle, bc your queue text channel will be full of match set ups
does it not drag if it‚Äôs optional?
nope
Tested it
Okay i'll try it, thank you!
It worked, thanks.
that seems like a mistake
anyone in the lobby channel should get moved
He had it on optional and didn‚Äôt get dragged
So i guess optional does that
i‚Äôll check it out üòÖ
was this talking about moving to team channels, or something else?
From lobby to queue
oh gotcha
true i see that
i think my original thinking is that it shouldnt drag since it isnt required
maybe makes sense
yeah yeah
If it‚Äôs optional and you join queue it will drag you into team channels with no problem
But from the lobby to queue vc it won‚Äôt drag, so yeah, it makes sense
for sure
Getting a lot of feedback about the bot taking forever to start the match. The queue will fill and then it takes several minutes for it to create the channel and vc
are you using the Match Making queue type?
Not sure
How can I check?
the queue name would say "Matchmaking Queue"
the match only starts if there are enough people within the current matchmaking range
you probably want the PUGs mode
So what if the queue is full?
If it has 4/4, can a 5th join?
with matchmaking, yes
it will create a match with the fairest player pool
Thanks I'll switch. Which command is that?
`/queuetype`
hello
a person from my game that literally flamed the whole game decided to report me and they ban me lol
thats unfortunate, but i cant help you üòÑ
Hey <@145305657237700608> 
Bot doesnt create voice channels and not sending queue message in chat
Bot have all permissions in this category
did u change perms? says its missing perms
i synced channel permissions to category permissions
will try one more time
Same thing
Idk why but NeatQueue role have all permissions in category, but it dont sync when creating queue channel
Or i need to give all the perms to the bot and not the role?
try giving to the bot
Still not working
For some reason queue channel is not syncing with category permission
yea the queue text channel definitely never syncs cuz it sets up custom perms for the match, like who can see/send in the channel
i can probably update it to at least copy the category perms, then build on top of them
ill have to see if that has any possible regressions
I gave all permissions to the role NeatQueue on server, now it looks like this
give it to the bot, not the role
Both bot and role have all permissions in this category + role have all permissions in discord server as well
does the bot itself have all the perms? not just the role?
i fixed it by giving bot role administator rights
that‚Äôll always work, i‚Äôll check out if there is an easier way to find what‚Äôs the issue
i enabled reset and disabled it and now all time stats are gone xd? or recoverable
i thought it would only roll over in september, enabling it in advance
did you enable monthly for the first time?
it showed August and All time
then i disabled it, now everything looks gone xd
yea, when you enable monthly for the first time, it pretends it‚Äôs a new month, so it‚Äôs fresh stats
it did keep the stats? until i Disabled it
i had the choice to show All time or just August
in all time i assume
all time is gone now
after disabling -> enabling
when enabled, you will see all time
im pretty sure i enabled it again, can double check
stats gone xd
yes, that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm trying to explain
when you turn on monthly, it only shows the current month stats, since monthly was disabled, the previous stats aren‚Äôt tied to this month
all the existing stats show in All Time
do monthly + reset ?
im afraid of messing things up more
you're telling me all data is kept unless i do Reset data?
Yeah, Monthly + Reset option showed All Time again
it doesn‚Äôt matter if you do reset or rolling
the previous data will show in All Time
Hi I gave my neat queue admin for my server but it‚Äôs not working
I have gave it permission
<@145305657237700608>
For some reason the bot put 5 on a team vs 1, its supposed to be 3v3
<@145305657237700608> This is happening with a different player as well
<@145305657237700608> i think this is the same party issue
Damn parties
Someone joined with a party?
What‚Äôs the team selection mode
Nope all solo queue, its matchmaking team selection
Is there any way to disable the DM that is sent alongside the AFK timer?
Can I restore a queue that we used /end queue on we ment to do /cancel but now

mmr increases/ decreases were reset
The "unfair" teams option now appears
And it doesn‚Äôt pick the map for you
nope
if u did /endqueue, the bot will show u a code, just do /load and put the code
then the code is gone
Gotcha
no parties?
what‚Äôs the config /save
LALPC
We haven't changed any settings in a while, first time this has happened
We had the same issue in my server
save code STDPC
that config is for 5v5?
Its meant for 5v5 but we also play 3v3 and 4v4 when there arent enough players in queue
did you forcestart with less players then?
they force started with 6 players in queue
shouldve made a 3v3 game, like it usually does
that makes more sense, still an issue
i have a fix, ill update soon
Is it possible for an Admin to cancel a queue or choose a winner even when they arent in the queue?
yea via /outcome
Ok thanks
please let us know when the update is live üôÇ
<@297752363534647297> <@171411763919585280> should be good
Thank you
Thank you so much üòä
np thanks for reporting it
by the way is it possible to add some roles (like mods) that can view the queue thread?
you can add a /staffrole
understood, thank you
I searched the docs by "mod" but couldn't find the one
Any suggestions as to why some of our users are showing as a bunch of numbers? 

Two screenshots of the same list. One from me one from another member.
It‚Äôs a discord thing
As in discord being a bit broken or individual user settings of some kind?
yea its a "discord moment" it means the discord client doesn't have that user ID cached, so it doesn't know who it is
Does it generally self-resolve?  Is it restricted to this bot? Is there anything I can do to reduce the frequency if it continues? 

Apologies, I‚Äôm quite familiar with my own server and what works but relatively new to discord. First time I‚Äôve seen this.
restarting the client sometimes works, otherwise youll need to view the profile/a message of the person who isn't showing up
<@145305657237700608> On my server there are 2 queues, I would like to know if you can add the mmr of the 2 on automatic
you will need to name them the same
Ok thank you very much have a great night
I run a FFA discord and just added your bot to it. In halo the top 4 usually are considered winners in a FFA is there anyway to make vote for the top 4 players to win instead of just the one player that got 1st?
<@145305657237700608>
that‚Äôs not supported
Dang
Think the only way to do this would be for an admin to *manually* give MMR/points to top 4 excluding the voted winner.
When the queue is created, the voting count does not update for the map and another custom setting, showing everyone has not voted yet forever. Is there a specific setting to show it or is it another bug?
could you share your code /save
It's OCOBJ
The voting options are not written in English (I don't think it would matter though)
seems to be working fine for me
does everyone see the same issue, or just you
I got a report from a server member about the issue
Let me check with some others too
so the issue occurs when the server language is set to Japanese (not sure about other non-English languages)
Could you check potential fixes with that?
ok i see the same issue, yea ill check it out
Thank you, keep me posted when you have an update on it üôÇ
<@145305657237700608> to confirm, can points be earned globally through different queues?
but the auto roles for points are per queue
just like other auto roles
are you using the command right now?
nvm i see what is breaking node 1
Not right now
Can I throw some bread your way to enable autoroles for points, global, shared from all queues or is it just not possible?
Which command do I use to close fixes the time
<@145305657237700608>
`/lobby timer`
nah, i dont see any benefit
It would allow servers to create global ranking systems in-server with points shared across all queues while keeping MMR queue specific for balancing.
well, a benefit for our server at least lol.
you can just copy the autoroles config to each queue
they're named differently to retain their respective leaderboards
that doesnt matter
its based on the points
but the auto roles only react to the highest point queue correct?
not all as an aggregate
points are global themselves
Sorry if I‚Äôm making it sound harder than it is lol just trying to make sure I understand I appreciate your patience and even the implementation of the command üß°

So if I wanted /autoroles to go based off of points, and I want players to be able to gain and lose points through multiple different queues with their own different names and their point total is shared between them

ie. A 2v2 queue earned a player 500 points, then that player plays a 4v4 and earns 1000. That players point total in the server is now 1500 and auto roles will understand this.

Is this is an accurate understanding? For a players points to he gained and loss globally from one pool of points which auto roles would understand
yea, points are a server wide stat per player
so when a specific queue's auto roles execute, it just looks at the players points value
doesn't matter which queue checks the value, itll be the same

crazy, thanks a ton!
Come message private please
It seems the map is determined by 3 votes regardless of how many people are in the queue, is there a specific setting to control the number of votes needed for the election?
by default its a majority vote
umm did I change something...?
JTXBF could you give me a help on it?
`/requiredvotes`
Is it possible to have per-vote requirement, for instance majority for map but three for another setting?
not currently
Hmm okay understood, thank you
I will apply majority for all then
When a voting menu allows multiple choices per user, it does not select the final choice until the timer expires even if one of the options has the unanimous vote.
But it is the intended behavior because another option could become unanimous too within the voting time, is it correct?
Also, if there are two or more options with tied voting does the bot select the final choice at random?
i‚Äôm let me double check that first part, but when there is a tie a random tied option is chosen
is this talking about a /votingmenu ?
No, this case occurs in the map selection vote. 

(I am managing the bot on the same server as them.)
in map selection, people only get 1 vote though?
Really? It seems that we have a bad setup and all the maps are selected once each.
I'll check and take a screenshot.
Looks like I'll have to wait for time up in this situation to move to the votingmenu.
queue configuration is HKHUO
4 votes each
Are you saying that our setup is wrong? It would be great if you could tell us where we are wrong. /map voting ?
i dont think map voting allows multiple votes
did you add a /votingmenu instead?
yes you did
besides that, seems like it should have ended the vote, ill check
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess there wasn't enough communication among us. I thought I was using the map selection.
Thank you. And by the way, I have a question: is it a spec that autoroles are removed when winning at the upper limit of MMR?

When a player with an MMR of 12 won, the roll was removed. The MMR remains at 12.
We have not tested what happens when a player at the lower end is defeated.
It should remove the role and then update the role for the user
lower bound is inclusive, upper bound is exclusive, if that is what you mean
Is it correct that "between 7 and 12" includes 7 but not 12?

We have it set up so that the MMR changes by 1. Am I correct in understanding that with the settings in the screenshot, people with MMRs of 3, 6, and 12 will not be granted roles?
thats correct
this is because MMR isn't an integer by default, so an MMR could be 513.31231515125
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> 
I understand. Thank you very much for your help.
<@145305657237700608> Is it currently possible to only allow point loss after reaching a certain rank threshold?

example: Players will lose 0 points from losses while players are rank 1-35, however after rank 35 (36-50) players will begin to lose points and de-rank from their game losses
not currently, i guess if i added a /points multiplier, similar to /mmr multiplier, that would work?
I assumed that was moreso for double xp kinda things. How would that work for losses? What value would I need to enter.
if there were seperate wins/losses commands, you would just set the loss multiplier to 0 for those ranks
these are all things that are possible by default with MMR lol
you could just set an /mmr floor
Oh yea, if there was a points version that would be lovley!
yea i guess /points floor would be the better approach
I love the idea of a win/loss command

How would points floor work, doesnt that set the lowest one can reach?
So for this players would still be able to rank up and gain points, but after exceeding that floor threshold they could no longer go down in points or auto role
yea for mmr floor, say the floor is set to 500. Anyone who is above 500 wont be able to drop below. Anyone who is below 500 won't be able to lose any MMR, but will gain MMR as per usual
> "Anyone who is above 500 wont be able to drop below"

> "Anyone who is below 500 wont be able to lose any"

Sounds like /points floor is what im looking for üôè
.

/points multiplier cant hurt either lol for double point weekends and stuff like that but specifically /points floor sounds like my solution today.
After using /clearqueue the bot works ok in terms of accepting people to the queue. But no longer sticks to the bottom of the channel or resends itself. I have tried re-activating both /queuemessage sticky and /queuemessage delay (3 seconds) which worked fine previously
There is channel chat below this; usually the queue would force itself to the bottom of the page and refresh every 3 seconds
yea the bot bugs like that sometimes for unknown reason, let me restart that node
<@145305657237700608> I'm gonna continue the conversation with you and <@648140340645068832> 
We currently have the following four issues:
~~1. When tie is enabled, a force-started game becomes tie after a certain period (our server is for Civilization multiplayer games that usually takes 2-3 hours so basically every force-started game goes to tie)~~ solved, thank you <@648635725964902411> 
2. Users seem to receive a DM even though we had `/autoroles notify` applied. Am I receiving it during testing the bot because I'm an admin?
3. Among the roles shown in the image below, only the yellow one doesn't work. Does the order matter?
to avoid the tie, you should increase the time of `/timer matchcleanup`
how do you setup the roles?
Working again, thanks
Thanks I set it up
its not showing mmr in names
oops, looks like i missed the notify setting with the updates yesterday, will fix
and order doesn't matter, maybe you have it set where each player can only get 1 role at a time
which ones
did you enable?
Understood, I've set the autoroles again (as I don't see if exclusive assignment is enabled or not) and hope it works now
true, the info doesn't show
Please let me know when you've addressed it, thank you
Yeah I'm glad if you update it to show the settings as well later
yes i think so
how do you so i can check
also it doesnt auto give roles when people join servee
/info last page
only when people queue
it doesnt make sense
Do /info
And go to the last page
done
for specific roles, losses to be doubled. Would that be /Points multiplier ?
can someone explain why they‚Äôre getting more elo
i have every form of streak thing off
<@145305657237700608> sorry for the ping but is there a cmd to like unregister all the people who aren‚Äôt in the server anymore
placement matches perhaps?
to hide from the leaderboard?
it was their 8th games
i think it was just a 1 time bug though
yk how when u do /ign it registers a new acc how do i remove people who have left the server so they jus don‚Äôt take space
mmr difference causes them to lose less?
that too, higher elo team will gain less and lose more
yeah they should have gained 12.8 im pretty sure
Also, is there any way to let a certain role use some commands and not all? like unlock or lock the queue but they cant wipe the leaderboard or change any settings with ut
Lock and unlock should be working fine now
no, you can't do something like that to let a specific role use a specific command, besides adding a /staffrole
yeah different thing
Good afternoon, I have a doubt
so that the person can execute commands in the bot, does it have to have the admin permission box turned on?
<@145305657237700608>
didnt when u invited the bot, the bot asked for perms
I know he asked for permission, but the question is that I want to know if I can add a role to be able to execute commands without having administrator privileges
you dont need admin to run commands, only manage channels, but you can add a /staffrole
if a lobby is created and the bot creats temp voice channel for each team how can i rename these channels?
`/teamnames`
well i guess i am stupid for some reason the channels always get called by the name of the player in it and how i set it up may it be because the channels are set for 1v1?
Maybe u toggled /teamnames captain?
<@145305657237700608> hello, people are registering with /ign and leaving the server after, is there a way we can remove them from the registered list?
if they are not in our server anymore.
we have purchased premium however it would be easier for us if the people who leave our server get unregistered from /ign
so it doesn't take up unneccessary slots
Umm I don‚Äôt think that takes up slots?
well i will try it xd
it does not
showing on the leaderboard takes up slots
well, technically having any queue data
still not works maybe because its a 1v1 queue?
Shouldn‚Äôt matter
actually, seems like a single player team takes precedent
yeah i see
I tested
can i do anything about it?
not rn, ill update the ordering so /teamnames is priority
since iam testing atm i want it to work with set teamnames xd  before i make it public
when might this happen?
ill update today or tomorrow
maybe a /point multiplier as well üëÄ
Is it possible to send a DM to all the players of the match when it is complete?
I want to send a post-match survey to the participants about their impression about the game
nope
Hmmm... maybe changing the result message to the link to the form so everyone can click it to navigate there?
no you can¬¥t
you can put the link on the footer of the queue message where people join
but its a premium only feature
ü§∑ you can use the new `/language override` to throw a link in the winner message footer
or anywhere for that matter
on the bot created by text?
oh yeah it would work
Understood, I will give it a try then, thank you
hello , i want to get all of command's this bot how plz ?
<@145305657237700608>
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/
Is there a way to do some kind of soft cap on MMR? For example once a player reaches 1700, the settings for /mmr change set swap to something different? Use case would be I don't want players who reach the max rank/mmr of 1700 to end up super high up in mmr, but they also don't want to be capped out at 1700. So I could have a 25 change set by default, but once you reach that max rank it goes to +1 per win for example.
Ping me if you respond, thanks
Can we then keep the match thread active for a while after the result is fixed?
you can set an autorole for when people hit that rating, then give that role an mmr multiplier of .05 or something
Great thanks
<@145305657237700608> sorry for the ping but is there anyway to make it so that a party can face people that aren‚Äôt in a party?
Are u using full team vs full team?
yeah
Just change it to select team on join
So people won‚Äôt need to have a party to join
It may have another solution but im not sure besides this one
Okay
<@145305657237700608> Adding points or setting the total points to *some people* does not change their autorole that was set by points. Sometimes it does sometimes it doesn‚Äôt
i definitely set it up so autoroles are checked when changing points, are you sure it was the same queue that has the autoroles?
Do I need to /auto role set points in every queue?
yes, autoroles are a queue specific config
how can i ajust the mmr so that the person with the lowest mmr gets more for a win and person with high mmr less?
how do i move stats from 1 queue to another
i forgot
is it save config
how can i let ppl use the /leaderboard command?
People can use it as default
ah ok
Migrate stats i think
my mate is trying it rn and he cant
nmv we made it
how can i ajust the mmr like this ?
that‚Äôs the default
ah, okay. I initially set it up once for all the roles in a *separate* channel. However now that I am setting up auto role points in every queue now and im seeing some positive effects, thank you.
Is there a way to make it so people that left the discord server are automatically removed from the leaderboard?
add @ everyone as a /requiredrole
i mean /rolerequirement
oh ok ty
if i revert/cancel a game the bot dont removes the mmr ppl got why so?
it does
hmm looks like the bot might be down
not sure
its not deleting channels right
Yeah our bot is offline too
lmao
bot went offline
what do you do if the other team did votes for the correct team when the game was over
What?
join team one
at the very bottom its hard to explain
or general
see the whole team didnt vote for the corect team and they left the server
how do i override it so that they willget the mmr
Just do /outcome selectwinner
didnt work\
it said That queue is not from this server!
<@857633321064595466>
it said it didnt respond
You doing it on your server and on the channel?
it just closed it
i didnt it wrong but thank you
ive just never had to do that so i didnt know what to do
aight
application did not respond for anything i attempt to do
also I have it set so there's mmr loss and tempban for dodging (not joining vc) but I think it punished everyone in the queue for it, even though they were waiting in vc. One dude didnt join and everyone got punished. Is that a setting I need to fix?
sometimes happens when the bot is buggin out, i would disable the dodge penalty
what causes the bot to bug out? Should I reduce the amount of queues that are happening at once somehow?
What can we do with the bot down?
no it‚Äôs not anything you can control, i haven‚Äôt found out why yet either
ok thanks
i ended a queue because it was very very very buggued
it said Interaction failed
so i decided to end the queue
anyways
i have the code
of the config
but i dont know how to start it again using the config code
that it had
`/load`
but also ending the queue doesn't fix anything
Do you know why a match don‚Äôt start and all the players are in the voice channel
there was a queue config that was causing the bot to run out of memory, which broke that match
What can I do? And I can‚Äôt cancel the match üòû
just delete the channel
should be fixed now
But know the players create another lobby and the same problem üò¶
you guys should be good now, i found the problematic queue
sorry bout that
outcome cancel dont work üò¶
The bot is having some problems rn, so be patient!
cancel doesnt work if the bot crashed mid setup, so there isnt anything to cancel
we should be good now
How can I add myself to the queue multiple times for testing?
like the image above?
/test
awesome thank you
hey, I'm wondering how do I setup the bot to have MMR for multiple games?
Can u be more specific?
I'd like an MMR for Black Ops Cold War and one for Black Ops 3 how do I do that? Please.
youll need 2 different queues, stats are based off the queue name, so name them different
ahhhhhhhhhh, thank you very much. Do I just start the queue and leave it up or do I have to start one every time?
just leave it running, no need to end
thank you so much
and is there a way to have multiple of the same queue in different channels? It just needs to have the same name?
If it has the same name it will share stats üëçüèª
how do I reset points? I've been testing and it's racking up my points and I'd like to reset them to 0. Please.
Resetting only points is not possible i think, you will need to reset all the stats, so /resetstats player
tysm
you can use /set points 0
for everyone, specify the @ everyone role
sorry for asking so many questions but does an admin pick what the type is once everyone is in the queue or is it voted on by the players?
by the players
is there a way to disable options like unfair, captains and stuff? We don't want people abusing it to get free MMR.
Yeah /teamselection and choose wich ones you just want to be displayed
thank you so much again, y'all have been extremely helpful ‚ù§Ô∏è
im trying to pay for premium rn but the neatq website wont allow me to log in
it gives me this thing and i press authorize then when it send me to the neatq website im just not logged in
Did it solve?
That‚Äôs eeirr
Weird
sounds like the website server didn‚Äôt restart after the issues yesterday
Seems like
The website reports that the bot it‚Äôs offline
says online for me
It just changed
what
that status comes from the bot itself as well, not the website server
i‚Äôll fix it in a little bit though
is the a way to change the server region and quality of the voice channels the bot creates?
isn‚Äôt that a server setting?
yes but you have to join the calls the bot creates and to do all that you need to have admins do it on the fly
but why would you want to change the region on the fly?
because we're split regionally EU/NA
and the EU people would lag if it auto set the region to NA
is there a way to have it default set to NA east?
it's the best region for everyone
just change the server setting then
if you want that as the default
how may I do that please?
oh idk i thought that‚Äôs a discord setting
It‚Äôs not i think
at least it uses to be a server setting
used*
i still cant log in
should be good now
how do I remove someone from the queue that didn't leave?
/player remove
tysm
<@251055034639319040> try again maybe? I hope neatZ is referring this to Dawggin lol
when our subscription ran out it automatically ended one of our queues i think
is there a way to get back the stats or is it all lost
do /load ILAMR
tysm
any time i try joining a queue, it just says this interaction failed
is there a way to remove MMR from people? Not delete all their stats.
You can remove mmr by /add mmr and typing negative numbers,
tysm
Hmm i can see node 2 is having a high cpu usage
so what can i do
try again? node 2 seems to be fine
nah its not working
can I move a queue from one channel to another (or thread) without losing any data?
Save and load it on the other channel
Wait
Yep like that
this is what happens
seems it can‚Äôt display all your parties
leave a party for now
it works
I have my queues in threads. I have the thread permission to send messages off, but now the queues buttons are toggled because of people's inability to type. Is there a solution to keep people from typing but able to interact with the queue?
wdym toggled?
Is there a way to make it where the new queue chat channels that are created, people can not type in it?
I set perms correctly but they can still spam the channel.
They‚Äôre greyed out
When the permissions are set that threads cannot be typed in, the queue inside the thread greyed out
Your server muted
Did u lock the queue or what
silly question,  I deleted a vote window before voting for winner. now am locked out of requeue.   any way to reset?
ending the queue does nothing.  blocked from new queues as well
even tried changing the vote requirement to disabled.
so it's obviusly setting flag on the player name
and a player reset doesn't clear it either.
that means the queue is locked
you can use /outcome
yera wizard 'arry!
Queue is not locked. This is happening when I disable the permission for people to type in threads. (Which is where the queue lives)
i‚Äôm not aware that permissions can effect button clicks, unless that‚Äôs a recent change
what happens if you right click the message and hit Apps - Toggle Buttons
"/votingmenu remove" is not actually removing the voting menu as indicated
still occurs when game happens
check the /info and see if it‚Äôs in the votingmenu page
yup still there
also retried deleting it and then doing info again
is there a way to declare a dnf?
is there a way to do it?
one person had to leave so how do I end without voting?
we figured it out nvm
/cancel
is there way to reset this for everyone?
sorry for asking again my bad thank you
for 1v1 queue this populates into the queues channel, what command moves this into its own queue-text channel?
that‚Äôs the right command, that message is a bit misleading
that‚Äôs the default location
For my 2v2 and 4v4 queues the bot creates a lobby-12345 channel where this would go into instead of the queue channel. Is there a way to do the same with 1v1s?
/tempchannels toggle should work
Thanks, I‚Äôll give it a try!
in my 1v1 queue, when 'best of' voting in initiated, the number of votes remains 0. Votes are actually counted, and the queue is able to proceed, but the front end visual number of votes is not updating.
like it‚Äôs not updating to show the final result?
how do you make it so you can host multiple at the same time?
like do another queue while another one is happening?
I‚Äôm trying to host multiple 10 mans in my server I just need to know how to do it
U mean another game while a game is happening?
That‚Äôs just by default, just queue again
The ones who aren‚Äôt playing the first queue just need to enter the another one
how do u do another queue
last time it got messed up
or ended the first queue
Just do another one?
It didn‚Äôt work
for us
or maybe we‚Äôre just stupid NGL but we have been trying to get it to work
What does it say
it works
i think theres a problem with team balancing when duo queues get implemented
nathan (795) and vacuolatebeef (783) are duod together, so are carseat (680) and hibachi (639) 
these duos each have 2 of the highest 4 players in the lobby, so why do they get paired together?
balanced team selection is meant to find team combinations with the closest possible average elo right?
how do we switch what channel the results go into? cause at first it was working fine now its going in a different channel
/resultschannel
tyty
Hello, I have a quick question. I use neatqueue in a small server to run matchmaking for Smash Ultimate. Is there an easy way to ensure that after players finish a match and requeue that those players wont be matched against one another?
you mean not again the same players?
Well I have it setup as 1 player teams with 2 teams required to start since its for 1v1. So an issue we're running into is when the match concludes both players will requeue and get one another again.
So yes, to answer your question. Sorry
are u using matchmaking type or pugs?
Matchmaking
i mean it shouldnt be always the same, matchmaking is mmr based
Right, I think the issue is though, because a lobby is made immediately when two players enter the queue then the queue is always empty when the two players reenter and so theyre immediately paired. Unless theres a method to set a requeue delay for only one player or change the range at which players mmr can match them against an opponent?
is the bot down?
There‚Äôs /requeue delay
But im not sure if it works on mm
That effects both players, no? I haven‚Äôt tried the requeue command bc that was my assumption. If I do a 60 second requeue timer and both players queue after the timer ends the same thing is going to happen I think. I may just need to try it out though.
there is an issue currently where team balancing with parties does not swap parties, so depending on the join order you can get an unfair setup
i‚Äôm not sure there is much else you can do besides use matchmaking queue type like you are
it won‚Äôt instantly make the match, so maybe someone else will join
I set an MMR floor to 0 and it's still going in to negative
do I gotta set the floor to 1 or something?
0 should work iirc
was the match already in progress
Gotcha, ty!
think it was
might have to reset everyone's stats
or just add the number of MMR until it's not negative anymore
i wouldn‚Äôt reset all lol
just manually fix people with negative
is there a way to add like 0.7?
says invalid integer
nope, but you can use /set
oh that's even better thanks
ok now people shouldn't be going in to the negatives?
i need help changing the r6 map pools as the comp map pool has adjusted
Wdym?
Is there any way to make the queue limit 12 people but only 8 get picked? I'm trying to make two captains pick for 2 teams of 4. But we want more than 8 players to queue, so some won't get picked
U mean if there‚Äôs 12 people on queue  , only 8 get picked?
yeah
those who didn't get picked can reenter a different queue
no that‚Äôs not supported, everyone in the match will end up on a team
how do we join with this bot
Invite the bot to your server
And do /setup
okay rhank you
what do i do with that
Did you give perms to the bot?
Hey guys

Setting up my queue & I am getting this error.

Appreciate any support!

Cheers
click it again?
they immediately gave up lmao, too complicated ig
Happens
Hello! I'd like to know if its possible to purge the list of members from the NeatQueue bot
I just hit my 1000 player limit and would like to start fresh
help Leaderboard nnot showing stats
im getting blank leaderboards
Has someone played yet on the queue?
so what does global queue do?>
is that if you want a single channel and multiple queues in the channel
Global queue means a queue that can be shared with other servers
Once you create a global queue you are limited to change some of the queue settings
How do I set starting MMR?
what's the /?
I want it as 0 not 1000
/startingmmr set
and how do I set the default queue option again? please
just want it on balanced
sorry I found it
does anyone know how to solve this?
That means your server hit the limit of the normal plan
If you want more players you will need to buy premium plan on the website
Hello, looking for some help Im pretty clueless but got thrown into this, trying to get a team queue going, everyone can queue up from their respective parties but once everyone joins the vc theres an error message
<@271014487451107329> looks like someone enabled that custom plugin
if you don‚Äôt want it, you can disable via /plugins
it requires a special setup, which the queue does not have, but i‚Äôm pretty sure you guys won‚Äôt be using that plugin anymore
Okay, I let Kotri deal with it : P
Thank you for the help
you can just do /plugin servermanager toggle Disabled
Okay it worked thank you üôè
ah, looks like new queues in the server default to having the plugin enabled, will change
Okie
oop, i thought i disabled it
but good good
nah you did
it‚Äôs a new queue, picked up the default as enabled
what's the command to set this?
one of my admins messed it up the other day
and now it's not appearing in the channel
staff channel I mean
when i create a full team vs full team queue its making the player create a team before joining.
it's not just putting everyone in a queue
that queue type is for full parties/teams vs another
change your /queuetype to PUGs
Just wanted to confirm if customisations are available in the 5credits a month plan as well?
yes they are
alright, thanks
the web isn't letting me pay ;-; redirects to https://www.neatqueue.com/manage/undefined
How do I make it so the Queue is always captain selection? I don't want them voting on captain selection, if MMR is used or not, etc.
try logging out and back in?
/teamselection
what is this?
Might be the leaderboard url, but not sure
doesn't work, tried everything I could do on my end
Cleared cookies, cache, browser change, vpn and things ü•≤
yea that‚Äôs the /leaderboardconfig shorturl
probably shouldn‚Äôt even be a public facing API lol, but converts the shorturl to the server and channel ids
oh lmfao
sick cheers
huge ty for making the api page so easy to follow as well 1st time using apis
thank swagger ui, i basically don‚Äôt have to do any work
not bringing you to the stripe page?
nope
redirects to void
wanna join vc? steam? imma show if u say?
<@145305657237700608>
bad request ;-;
oh so it‚Äôs not even showing you your server dashboard
its not getting me to payment page
not me (India) neither a friend (NYC, US)
how do  now resolve this? I needed things quick. Manually, if possible?

<@145305657237700608>there u have it
Hey everyone! I would love to use Neatqueue as a PlayerQueue from my Tik Tok LIve but I can't figure out how to do it. Has anyone done this?
things dont explain each other?
does the bot have a way to show people's MMR next to their names in the server?
yeah check docs https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=show-mmr-in-name
`/ratinginname format` is what u looking for probably.
how does this work?
and is there a way to set two different queues MMR in people's names?
please
The default format would be Name (0000) i think
If u wanna change it
That‚Äôs for that
Hello,
any way to disable text chat in queue? more specifically, attachments/links?
I tried to set permissions, but not sure, it just resets every queue.
Getting people spamming the queue text channel when theyre forming teams with gifs/links, and we cant select teammates, or ban maps,
You can change category settings to don‚Äôt be able to send images
Ah, thats what I did, but they were still able to send
I believe its because neatqueue sets the perms to the specific people in the channel
hmm could be
Is there a way to get rid of the buttons except random and players pick?
/teamselection
I paid for the bot to be up but it says "this queue is no longer running" should i wait a few more minutes?
Wdym?
You bought a plan?
yeah basic plan for more than 3 q's or wtv
if it ended a queue automatically, you need to use /load with the code
thanks, fixed it
Names of voters aren‚Äôt being shown, is there a way to fix? Might just be me not knowing lol
is the vote actually working?
<@145305657237700608>
the buy page is not working
<@145305657237700608>  how do i remove the stats of people no longer in my server so that spaces arent taken
its working for me, i havent been able to find any issue, are you staff in the server?
yes i own the server, i clicked buy on credits and it went blank
what browser?
google
my friend tried it too, did not work
google aint a browser brother
chrome
can you open the network  tab and see what the request says?
check dms
you can manually reset their stats via /resetstats player or reset all stats
will that clear everyone who has registered their ign?
no it has nothing to do with ign
what if people register their ign and then leave the server after a game played, is there a way to get rid of them
also when will the buy page be fixed
you can remove their stats using their ID, mentioning them like `<@132313>`
as for the buy page, im not sure, i cant reproduce it myself, its working for me so it makes it hard
right after i put in how many credits i want to buy, i put "20" and click buy then it brings me to this blank page
brings me to this - https://www.neatqueue.com/manage/undefined
ah there's a lot of people who have played in my customs and then left the server after, so it would take forever to remove them all, maybe in the future there might be a command to mass remove unknown entitys who are no longer apart of the guild?
<@145305657237700608> any insight of if this is my fault or fixable?
Does `/hidestats` mean the stats and MMR will not be visible to anyone in the server (except for the moderators)?
Including in the leaderboard?
<@145305657237700608> Please DM, I found out what was the issue when buying things
is there a way for separate leaderboards? For example, I have an NA queue and an EU queue, is it possible to get separate leaderboards for this?
use the slider to make the total amount a whole number, that just worked for me, now I have a very uneven value of credits on my account
That means when a player does /stats it will only show for the user
Just link each queue to it‚Äôs channel where the leaderboards are going to be displayed
The problems seems to see it bugs when a player does a custom input
Custom input looks like its bug
Did it solve itself? Or no, also, are u using custom json?
perfect you found the cause, i can fix it today üôÇ thanks
<:worrystonks:926778635694788638>
took my hours, made me cry and lastly it was the slider ü•≤
Is it possible for match logs to show a players new global point total in addition to the displayed MMR increase?
I will investigate
Don‚Äôt think so
U could try something with the json, but not sure if it will work
what json are we talking lol
The language override
if they have one that would make sense
since there have been issues with other languages and message edits
I was too lazy to type language override
is there a way to disable the option of forcing the players to join the voice channel ? i just need the queue text channel
/voicechannels mode
Optional
awesome thanks !
is there a way to change the name of the queue channel it makes once all players join the queue?
the text channel?
correct
yes /tempchannels name
awesome! thanks again! great bot btw
np and thanks!
Bot just stopped working on the ranked wool wars server
No one can queue and I can‚Äôt run any commands
bot is crashed everywhere
yea node 2 keeps dying
unfort
Bot is working for us again <@562667788842565652>
So it still appears in the leaderboard... OK thank you.
Bot died again
yoyoyoyo
i run a high level rocket league priv server and we use this bot and it‚Äôs glitching hard today is that an issue on you guys‚Äô end or are we doing smt wrong
<@145305657237700608>
node 2 kept getting stuck due to a weird queue config, i found the issue, bot shouldnt restart randomly again i hope
so it‚Äôs you guys then?
yes its me
you think it‚Äôll be back working well sometime tonight
its working fine right now
There is an unidentified issue with this queue, could some staff please DM the owner <@145305657237700608>
we got that msg 10 mins ago
oh its your queue
you have people with 1000000000000 mmr which is breaking things, please reset to a normal number while i fix for future
what
do i have someone with that
highest person on lb has 1834 mmr
try /stats waves
or LilPlayer
what did lilplayer do
they have 1000000000000 mmr
what the hell
i don‚Äôt see that
he maybe added it manually
if u dont have games you wont appear on leadearboard
in the "soap mans" queue, waves has 1000000000000 mmr
varietyytv set the starting mmr to 1000000000000
i fixed it
it was not me i apologize
let me check across all your players
is there anyone else
you have 14 players like that lol
do `/leaderboardconfig requiredgames 0`
then check leaderboard again
holy balls
can you do a command to reset them in like 1 command or do i have to them all manually
you can give them all a role, then /set all their MMRs at once?
i dont have anything on hand to fix
im gonna hotfix this anyways so this doesn't break the entire bot
okay
we fixed the mmrs
is there anything else
i see that, looks good, will unblock your queue, thanks for fixing
thank you so much
you are good to go
variety is not the smartest he will receive a spanking
its not really your fault, while a weird situation, it shouldnt break the bot, so thanks for finding that out for me
at least it‚Äôs all fixed now hahaha
is there a way for the party queue to allow a minimum amount of players? For example, I want my queue to start with 4 players per team minimum, allowing up to 11 per team. But I want the queue to be able to allow parties of under 11 to join the queue. Because up to 11 players are allowed per team, but it doesn't need to be even numbers per team, just minimum of 4 per team.
Not to backseat or anything here but I think the intended use of parties is to create and disband them per play session? Unless that is already the case
yea that‚Äôs usually what i would have in mind
is this for a game that allows any number of players on a team? or is this to allow subbing within the team itself?
Sorry if this is documented somewhere, is there an option to change the leaderboard link here?
change it to the shorturl?
hey, how can I do it so that mmr is the same in every queue e.g there's 3 different ranks but the mmr doesnt translate into every queue
like one rank's mmr starting mmr is 2300 but when it goes into another q it resets to 1000
u have to name all the queues with the same name
ok it worked
ty <3
how do i get access to more than 3 queues at a time ?
Buying premium
On the neatqueue website
ok thx
This is for  FIFA pro clubs. Teams have 11 spots each available on the game itself, but I want them to be able to start a game as long as they have 4 players each. So for example, one party of 4 might enter the queue, fully ready to play against another party who queues with a full 11. Does this make more sense?
i see what you mean yea
So... is it possible?
is it normal for /add points to be kinda slow? gave points out a while ago but still havent seen the auto role change.
Leaderboard isn't showing anything beyond page 1
i found an issue where if you give someone points in a queue channel, and they dont have stats in that queue, they dont get autoroles
That's unfortunate üò¶ is this something unintended?
yea i have a fix
after you can use /autoroles refresh
for now Im able to load the queue config in a private channel, add them to the queue manually with /player and it seems to give them their correct auto role now
yea if they are put into the queue  that would fix their issue
not ideal but I found a work around üôÇ will patiently wait for a fix ‚ù§Ô∏è
you could probably /add 0 mmr to everyone lol
that would get them in the queue's system
ahh let me try
<@145305657237700608> So is what I'm asking possible, sir? I know you are busy, so let me know when you can üòÑ
yup looks like more ppl received their correct ranks and hopefully from this point on will continue to be promoted üôÇ Thanks Neat!
it should be, i just need to think of if i want a new queue type or just some command to change it
Okay, let me know what you come up with <@145305657237700608>
is there a way to disable voting on winners ?
yep /winnermessage results
will that keep the current players from queuing up again before i delete the channel ?
i need a way to stop players from queuing again before finishing the match
no it won‚Äôt
the voting is what blocks it
Hi! I need to ask some question <@145305657237700608>
I want players to join the queue by entering the voice. how can i get this
you can create a match from people in a voice channel with /startfromvc, but the normal use case is people click the queue button
After entering the voice chat, I want to have a command that 10 people on channel x are ready, how do I get this?
you can use /startfromvc
set up a queue in a channel, then use the command in there to use all the same settings
if the command even works, it not used often at all
Thanks
only been used 200 times in 2 years basically
looks like it doesn't work currently
I am trying
How can I get mmr to appear next to the player profile? <@145305657237700608>
Like
Disturbed (1000)
I'm still unsure about the best format/how to properly use the format but yeah. Thats the command.
Thanks
default format would be NeatZ - (1000), but if you want the format you said, set the format to ($)
Thanks
Having a little problem with the bot. I've used different configs and made my own with no change in the outcome.

When I queue (test mode), it will put me from the VC Lobby channel to the VC Queue channel. However, it will say I didn't make it after a few seconds (when the stall period before canceling is 5 minutes. It will then create another queue channel and move me into that one, repeating the ban process until I have over 30 messages reading multiple bans while creating multiple VCs
Thanks for the help in advance
The one thing they all have in common is they are on the matchmaking format. Is it not possible to utilize test mode for this?
/requeue matchcancelled
Also test mode decreases timers
I saw that, but the requeue matchcancelled doesn't explain why it's not starting the voting phase once I'm in the intended channel.
The requeue matchcancelled is to avoid creating new voice channels
The vote won‚Äôt start because you need to set voicechannel to optional
In test mode
Ah, fully understood.
you don‚Äôt need voicechannels to be optional for test mode
but if it auto moves you to the queue voice, it won‚Äôt recognize that it doesn‚Äôt need to keep waiting in test mode
if you left the voice and rejoined, the votes would start
Hey <@145305657237700608> do you have any ideas on a fix to my question from last night? I will ask it again in case you forgot.

I want the queue to allow parties up to 11 to join, as there are 11 open spots per team, but the queue is allowed to start when there is at least 4 on each team, as parties will not always have 11 people available to play. The problem right now is if I set the amount of players per team to 11 for the queue, parties of under 11 are not able to join. I want parties of atleast 4 to be able to join. Please help me out! Thank you. I see you are helping people all day, thanks for your hard work.
yea i have an idea on a good way to change it, i might do an update tonight
Any chance U can flex downwards instead of across on mobile üò≠

It's not an urgent issue since I can just view desktop version just fyi
Sounds amazing, thank you so much
lol, yea i‚Äôll change that direction
there u go
So what do I do? Is it automatically like that now?
check <#910981294937210930>
Amazing. Thank you so much.
how do u edit the permissions for the ranked vc channels
You can‚Äôt directly edit them like discord does
What perms do you want?
nah i want to change it to a custom seperate link (sorry for the late reply didnt see you replied) (eg website.com/leaderboard)

My plan is to call your api from my site and display it along a bunch of other details like input device etc etc etc
unless youre saying thats what shorturl does and i misunderstood>?
Shorturl will make a website of the leaderboard
Yeah but what if i want a custom url on the leaderboard button, I assume its not possible?
eg i want paz.com
you just can name the leadearboard
Not the website
It would be like https://www.neatqueue.com/lb/(leadearboardname)
I want to make it so that our muted role is unable to speak in the vc
That would be your server integrations, not the bot at all
What
Just configure your role
server settings > role >permissions
its all off
but theres channel permissions
that override that
go into the category permissions and set the role to deny speak
there's a command that makes the admin votes primary?
how do i make the ranked vcs follow the category permissions
because in my server rn the ranked vc permissions and the category perms r different
the voice channels will copy the category perms when created
thats not happening tho
the ranked vc perms are different than the category perms
they will inherit the category perms, then make changes
the new VCs cant be exact copies, they need to be team specific
We have EU and NA separated in our server. Different queues and leaderboards. Is there a global leaderboard available?
Or is it already a global leaderboard
the only way to get a shared leaderboard is if the queues have the same name
Thats not how its working in my server for some reason
These are the category perms
But these are the perms for the ranked vcs that get created
Just the same name? That would be awesome. So even if there are two different queues for both regions, if they have the same name the leaderboard will track them together?
yes exactly
Hello there! Is it possible to add members not in Discord to queue? <:think:562690529108819978>
no thats not possible, they must be in the server
you can try, idk what will happen tbh
I did try. It asked for me to give Discord member <:Ero_Deadge:1069404182106361916>
So that is not possible huh. Got it. Thanks for the info <:CodeThumbsup:913014489299955733>
how do you enable captains I can't remember and I can't find it in the docs
/ teamselection
So is there a way to toggle dynamic mmr
Like enabling winning or losing more or less based on how much mmr you have relative to the teams
Appreciate if someone could get back to me about this
yea /mmr change set static:True/False
<@256678976670531584>
Hi i am making a roblox football 6v6 matchmaker
basically
i have a server
dedicated to finding PUGs for players in the server
so it isnt anything outside
Alright nerds, give me a command to make dynamic rr for a +60 -60 range. Thank you, have a great day.
the PUGs are only with the players
in the server
i need help
i want at the end of the game
for players
to vote for an MVP
and the MVP gets extra mmr
is that possible
yea, /mvp toggle
Ok thanks
also
what commands
do i need
to make one
that looks like this
if you do /mmr change set 50, itll be close enough
`/roles Goalkeeper,Field,Field,Field,Field,Field`
with 2 teams
i tried that but the field had individual ones
like it was 5 individual
fields
not sure what you mean
thank you
just try out that exact command
it worked!
how do i disable MMR completely for a specific queue, i have 2 queues for my server, ranked and casual, i want casual to have no MMR just play for fun, and i want ranked to have MMR
set the mmr change to 0
Thanks
Ngl i feel bad for asking so much i hope u dont mind but
How do i start a match automatically when the teams are filled up Oh but in the game im using someone needs to manually create a private match for players to join, how would i go about this?
Also i want MMR to be a fixed amount the way it says it it feels like its in a range of numbers and i dont quite get this, i just want the winning team to recieve 25 MMR, the losing team to lose 10 MMR
that‚Äôs the default behavior
/mmr change set 25 static:True loser_mmr:10
thank u so much
wb MVP
mvp i want to recieve +10
alongside the 215
/mmr change set 25 static:True loser_mmr:10 amount: ?????
got it
dont bother answering
i understand
Hi guys, Im getting familiar, but still nooby with using bot, could you please let me know how can i cempletely delete queues i do not use?
Pretty sure
unluckily.. i guess not.. I mean i can't create more queue, but still using only one
so i guess the not used ones block me from creating another one
basically
do /link #(channel in which the unwanted queues are in)
If u want to delete those queues you need to do /resetstats all on the queue you want to delete
can u make it so a players MMR is in their server name profile
and it gets automatically updated
/ ratinginname toggle
but with /rating in name format
what do i do
i want it to display it like this
<@1082349017486336121> - 1000 MMR
`- $ MMR`
how do i actually start a match
i dont get it
you just have to fill the queue
how do I delete everything but the random and captains?
/teamselection
:0 tyty
is there any way to edit what stats are displayed to players? I have my mmr system hidden, and just want them to be able to view their match history, wins, and losses
no thats not possible
exactly what i needed, thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Is there a way I can talk to someone for support?
like in a voice channel?
If your issue is not that big or can be solved easily just type it here
Kind of need assistance setting up the whole thing lol
did u try /setup ?
yeah, having trouble with specific things that I'll like to explain
wich ones
I'm basically trying to setup a CoD 8s cord that people are able to queue to. I did the queue text channel, but I'm trying to figure things like having the queue voice channels that appear only when the queue is full and disappears once the best of 3 has ended.
Also, settting up the voting system for "Captains" "Random" "MMR" etc
Also, I want to set it up so that there's a text channel where they would have to vote for that, pick teams, pick the maps, vote for winner, vote to  cancel queue, etc
thats all default behavior
besides best of 3, which is just `/bestof`
u can test via `/test`, and join a bunch
when i enter /test it doesn't do anything
It does
It puts your queue in test
You can join multiple times in the queue to test by yourself
am I able to speak to one of you guys in a server and share my screen?
i mean everything you described you can do it by just /setup, except the bestof
also im not able to talk rn
How do I make a timeout for someone who constantly joins the queue but doesn't join the queue channel nor votes?
/ player autoban
Can i change it from banning them after doing it more than once, or does it do it after the first time?
The first time
I want to have a "stats" text channel where the players can check their stats. How do I do that
just do a channel called stats
They can type /stats
So the player will be able to type  "/stats" in the channel
What if I'm having 2 different games being played with 2 different queues, how would one of the stats channels know what game is the MMR & W/L referring to?
Why doesnt it ping everyone in the queue
Just gives an invisible message
is it possible to auto assign a second/third place role using the "autoroles top players set" command without those roles overlapping with 1st place
how do i remove testing mode from my queue channel
Type /test again
The queue channel is tellinng me I'm missing a permission, but I'm the owner of the cord and have every permission
The bot is missing permissions not you
Should I give the bot the "Administrator" role?
Gave the bot the role to manage channels, the error went away, but the "join queue" and "leave queue" interaction isnt there
What does "Auto PIng" do?
every command has a description
that makes it easy if you don‚Äôt care
the join queue and leave queue interaction isn't  popping up
interaction?
not currently
probably just your app, see if other people can see it
The box that says "Join queue' and "Leave queue"
It doesn't even come up when I do /test
No one can
different person not you
what isn‚Äôt coming up
the box entirely
This one
if you see nothing, it‚Äôs missing perms
The "Enable MMR" Option is for players to have the match affect their MMR or not?
If thats the case, can I set it up so that every match affects MMR?
/ mmr change allow_disable allow_disable:False
I want the queue voting order to be 1. Captains, Randoms, etc 2. Picking team 3. Game Mode Pick 4. Map Picks
How do I add the game mode pick?
I added the maps, but How do I add the gamemode options
specify the gamemode when you add the map with /map add
how do I make 1 team random side
like between attackers and defenders, random between team 1 and 2
How do I make it so that if you're in another channel in the cord it drags you automatically to the queue channel
Also so that it will require all individuals to be in the queue channel inorder for people to start voting for captains etc
check out https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobbydetails-set
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobbychannel-pullall
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=voicechannels-mode
Thank you for your help
One last thing I believe lol, How do I put it so that after voting for everything it automatically takes you to Team 1 or Team 2 Voice channel. When I test it it doesn't do that, it just asks you to vote for winner
thats the default behavior as well
How do i change the name of where it says ‚Äúqueue‚Äù
It creates it after the queue is full
And if theres multiply queues the queue is going to stay the same. I want it to change to ‚Äúqueue #1‚Äù ‚Äúqueue #2‚Äù etc
that channel name cant be changed currently
When I do another queue on another channel it does what I want it to do
what are you asking?
Theres no way I can change that?
Mightve messed that part up in the setup process
for the CW one
change what
on the first picture I sent it just says "queue"
on the second one it says "queue 20"
you mustve changed the `/tempchannels name`
Hello, how can I make an option to ask if teams are fair after the matchmaking but before starting the game? If answer is not then reshuffle
what matchmaker?
MMR based
"Balanced by MMR"
oh, you can‚Äôt shuffle that
it‚Äôs not random at all, it‚Äôs based on MMR
I saw something like that in a discord server, they could balance their teams by saying if it's fair or not
Maybe other matchmaker?
if you do random then you can reshuffle
I see, I'll try thanks
It just makes the teams anyways
with random teams it‚Äôll ask if they are fair unless you turned that off
with /reshuffle
should be on by default iirc
how do i make this
unchangeable
i want it to only show MMR
Hey I have a user who mentioned that they can‚Äôt see the queue status in the channel the queue is running is this a known bug? They see the buttons to join
make sure this is enabled
Ok thanks
you cant remove them, but  you can change who can use the buttons via `/leaderboardconfig edits`
is there a way to display MMR in name like this?
says mmr after name then a space between the mmr and the numbers
nvm I figured it out
How do I put it so that it puts the active players from the previous queue in the following queue automatically?
also, the bot isn't pulling people automatically. and i have that option enabled
<@145305657237700608> just got this same exact bug in our server, mind doing the same fix when you get a chance <:peepoHeart:689362282316169217>
that‚Äôs not a thing currently
what server name?
Purdue Rocket League
kk should be good
<:LFG:909649572350009344>
<@145305657237700608> The bot just started creating channels outside of the categories we set for different queues. Is there a fix to that?
let me restart node 1, will fix
<@145305657237700608> the bot is not transfering people to the queue channel when the queue is full
it was working fine earlier, what changed?
how long has it been happening
bot just restarted for half the servers
it was happening this morning so i stopped hosting customs for a little, then it started happening again around 7-8 minute ago
just got 10 people in the queue and still did not transfer to the queue
and were getting banned for not bing in the channel
whether or not it moves you automatically doesn't impact the autoban, if you arent in the voice youll get the ban
whats ur server and channel ID
1114162906871898112
1114279372048846929 - matchmaking vc
its not set to auto move everyone
you need `/lobbychannel pullall`
one sec
Is there away to get rid of mmr and games played on the leader board
You mean the sections?
I have messed around with the bot a little bit but not finding the exact solution for my need, maybe someone can review quick.

Looking to host a tournament, where people sign up as **a solo queue **and if we get 12 then run 4x3 or 16 run 4x4 teams.

Once we get to 12 or 16, we create captains based on sign ups.

Ideally a ready check is sent out (people can sign up early in the day then forget/cant join)

Then captains pick in snake draft order (saw this in command).

Assuming they can choose their team via clicking someones name?

Brackets rolled > start
yeah
U can‚Äôt
this isn‚Äôt supported
the current tournament system requires a team to sign up, there isn‚Äôt any team setup
you would have to do a regular queue
Ok and what I've tested then is regular q hits the number then instantly starts and pings everyone right
Hmm damn ok.
by default yes
you can turn off the auto start via /misc startwhen
Can you then put people into captains draft once the queue is full?
Sorry I feel like I just asked the same question as above lol üòî
Our use case is weird and can't find a tool to help automate it lol
yea you can directly goto captains selection via /teamselection
change the setting
Ok I tried to do that but must be missing a step.. Lol. Queue was full then it just ping and no capt selection for snake pick
i‚Äôm not sure what you mean sorry
You can solo q and then go into capt selection?
That's what I tried to do but then didn't work as expected lol
when a queue fills up you can pick teams however you wanna configure
Ok I need to explore more. Is there a way to test this without creating like 6 discord alt accounts?
Or just have 6 patient friends ü§£
you can use /test
and join a bunch
Ok ill check it out further... Sounds like we maybe can manipulate the existing flow for our use case.
Appreciate the replies
np and gl
how do i set up when everyone clicks que it drags them to the que channel and then to a diffrent channel with there team?
can somone set it up for me would mean alot
can i transfer
an entire queue
to another server
use /lobbychannel pullall
the queue config can be saved and transferred via /save and /load
trying to test, puts me into queue channel then msgs me im banned from setting up üòÑ ...
did you join the voice?
no didnt
but it gave me a 5 minute timer then kicked me after like 15 seconds
yea it‚Äôs in testing mode
if i can disable that, that would be ideal
our people are slow af
how do i check my points in my server?
you should disable testing mode if you are playing actual games
still testing, i just mean can I disable the "kick you in 5min if you're afk" rather do that manually
you can extend the /lobbychannel timer
wdym?
it says i can bet points
how do i know how many points i got
you can check your /stats or click the predict button
bet thank you
captains selection... can I set the 2 people who I want to be captain? i see only votes, balanced, mmr etc
you can give them a captains role and set the role via /captains role
ok and im testing the queue... if i predict 16 ppl will sign up but only 12 do, and I change to 3 teams of 4, it kicks everyone from queue?
<@145305657237700608> hey, is there a way to get more than 10 people in queue?
yes, changing the team size or number of teams will have to reset the queue
you can overfill a queue if you disable auto starting via /misc startwhen
as soon as I pick team, 1 it disbands tour despite another match being played.. this part im not understanding, should it not be team 1 vs team 2, then winner faces team 3?
im assuming a bracket style tournament lol
like this, 16 ppl signed up, 4 captains, shows bracket for 4 people
it‚Äôs not a tournament system
it‚Äôs a single match being played
oh im dumb
ok 2 more questions or else i probably cant use the bot for my needs. can i disable the timer for autopick and can i disable the voting for winner or at least delay it for long time? I can at least copy/paste the teams and make my own bracket
first one is /timer votes
delay the voting like when the message is votable? or when it auto picks a winner?
that part
yea /timer winnervotemessage
kk and for this, 16/12, i would expect it allows 4 teams of 4, but it only allows 3 team of 4 when we roll
cuz the current queue is set for 3 teams of 4
ah kk, thats the hard part, we have such a small community and dunno how many ppl will show up lol
i wouldn‚Äôt even try to do a tournament like this
normal matches would be much easier
trying to manipulate it so it flows like this
setup teams of 4
start queue
pick captains based on people in queue
run bracket
through this queue? or diff bot?
This bot
ok good üòÑ 

how would i attain this outcome then
setup teams of 4
start queue
pick captains based on people in queue
run bracket
something of that sort
you mean 8v8 right
If u mean like that, just do a **/startqueue queuename:Name teamsize:8 numberofteams:2**, then if you always want to be captain do **/teamselection** and only select captain
No sorry it's like 4v4v4v4 tournament, so team 1 vs team 2 then 3 vs 4 and then say team 1 and team 3 for finals.
It's diablo 2, 4v4 in two diff games then winner faces each other
if you know you have 16 players, you can do 2 teams, 4 player teamsize, 2 lobbies
so it‚Äôs a 4v4 and another 4v4 at the same time
<@145305657237700608>It's happening again Lol
will restart
do i make
a queue
like this
have captains
yo for some reason
i cant link
there are no captains in this type of queue
wdym
look
wait
is there a way to vote for a queue to start early? Say my queue is 8v8, but the game can easily support 3v3 if not enough people join, could they start it early? I'd like to do a month long competition where people can play at any time, and team size doesnt really matter
its not showing
everything
<@145305657237700608> what are the requirements for a channel to show up on /link
im using onboarding
what does this mean
when you link to a channel, it will be linked, and you can only link to one channel
how do i remove
all links
its bugging out
u must vote for the winner
oh but i deleted
the queue
whilst a match was going on
cause it bugged
the match isn‚Äôt gone
it is
ive deleted
the channel
where the match happened
fully
i think i fixed
what about this
discord onboarding
actually sucks bro
makes everything bad
i cant even # specific channels
for some reason
you can do captain selection via /teamselection
Is there a way you can make it randomly select from a pool greater then 10 for stream purposes? like is there a command for that already instead of sleecting the first 10?
change /misc startwhen to Forcestarted
then /misc shuffleonstart to Lottery
and use /forcestart when you wanna start the game
MY GOAT i appreciate you guys
/forcestart
If I link a channel to the queue can they do that command in that channel? I don't want anyone typing in the queue chat
yup any command used in the linked channel will pretend it‚Äôs in the queue channel
how do i start the queue from the config given
Can i make 2 different queues
have the same leaderboard
My server hsa EU and NA members
there is 2 queues, EU ranked queue, NA ranked queue
i want a global leaderboard
to show whos ontop
Name them the same
wdym
Name the two queues the same
Hey, I just used the resetstats mmr command for my queue which I already used 3 months ago in order to make a hard reset. Last time every players' mmr have been set to their rank base mmr and their games to 0 (if I remember correctly). Now after I used that command no one was shown in their leaderboards (even using the leaderboardconfig requiredgames 0 command) and once I tried checking my /stats, I got deranked by the autorank cause I was 1000mmr (i think the bot's base mmr)
wasn't that the right command? I wrote down the commands I used last time and it seemed working properly 3 months ago
check your /info, what is your starting mmr?
Starting MMRs
ops everyone* - 1000
@RANK A - 3050
it‚Äôs disabled don‚Äôt worry
oh great
did you have the Rank A role?
but I was rank A already and I had the mmr
also it's weird that once I /set games 1, everyone was showing with the right reset mmr, but their games played were wrong
wrong how
it showed the games from the previous month (before the hard reset)
maybe I need to reset something else?
oh you have monthly leaderboards enabled
nope
i'm manually resetting every month
what‚Äôs the server id?
1043184884212043848
what‚Äôs the queue channel id
every queue channel for every rank, 1064542976417738802 this is one of them
we also set the games to 1, but it appears they have more of them
ok so for 1, using /resetstats mmr only resets mmr nothing else
ok i think i figured it out
basically, once I used the resetstats, no players appeared, but once I /set games to 1, the command didn't set their games to 1 but actually made them appear in the leaderboard
so probably the moment I used the resetstats, it just put everyone in a "limbo" xd
like temporarily reset until I used the /set games 1 in every queue channel
yea when you reset mmr, nobody appears on leaderboard
when you used /set games, it gives the starting mmr for each of the players
yeah, so I had to use /set games 1 and then /set games 0 to make them appear normally in the leaderboard
did this change from 3 months ago? because I don't remember doing it like this
no it‚Äôs always been like that
probably doesn‚Äôt need to do that though
it just ensures a player has default stats before modifying their stats
ex: so you can add 100 mmr to players without any mmr
so is there a way to make it simpler next time I want to hard reset?
I thought about using /resetstats mmr queuename:*queuename so everyone would be at the default mmr of their respective rank
but I was thinking the only alternative is to manually set games/wins/losses and mmr for each rank
why not just use /resetstats all?
and that resets the mmr aswell?
yea it wipes it all
but resetting just the mmr would work fine
i‚Äôm not sure what you were looking for
i guess if you just wanted to have everyone show on the leaderboard, you can /resetstats mmr, then /add 0 mmr to everyone
that way everyone gets their starting mmr again
but wins and losses stay
i'm very confused cause I also found my previous reset message and it was resetstats mmr, and everyone suddenly appeared on the leaderboard
but yeah, I guess I'll do it that way
Nevermind I think I undestood why
There was a step I didn't write down last time so it's all my fault sorry
how do i delete a queue, and the mmr ranting after name isn't working
delete queue /resetstats all and then endqueue
like remove the queue entirely
the mmr rating after name is confusing me
like the nicknames aren't changing
for everyone?
i want the mmr to be a suffix like "mmr-$"
i did that
nobodys nickname changed
did they join queue?
so when u join queue it changes ur nickname on the server?
in the default mode, yes
okay so i do "/ratinginname format format:elo-$ location:Suffix"
then it should change when you join
if it is toggled on, yes
and the bot has perms
okay
lemme make sure both are on
i did both
so when they join it changes to the default i set
is there a way to make it so when people reach a certain number of mme they receive a role and it removes their old role?
check out /autoroles
still not working
so it‚Äôs not working for anyone in your server
can i make a punishment so they aren't allowed to queue for [insert time]
like with a role
you can use /player ban
for a temp ban
hey how do i make it so it moves people automatically
That‚Äôs by default
Or do you mean from a vc to the queue too?
Hey, how can I have several queues linked to 1 MMR?
u mean 1 leaderboard?
you can make all the queue's MMR lead to 1 leaderboard
by making all the queue's have the same name
/queuename '...#
Hello
im making a REP system
where players can rep up
after getting a certain amount of MMR
im using roles for this system
but im wondering
if there is a command
for ranks
so i can use the system with commands instead
yes use /autoroles
ok so it's giving people with 1 mmr the gold role how do I fix it?
is it all setup wrong?
can neatqueue ranks be customized to use these emblems from Halo2 as roles/ranks? 
Players get to level 10 they unlock queues 10-20 and when they hit rank20 they unlock 20-30 queue? 

Not sure if you guys do any custom coding for specific servers, but definitely interested in building on what‚Äôs out there then building a bot from scratch? I‚Äôm trying to resurrect a halo server that had a rank system/ queue just like this. 

Thanks for making this bot, it awesome
You can add the emojis to the roles
Then you create queues just for the roles, like a queue for rank 1-9, another to 10-20, and so on.
/lobbychannel set
i think custom emoji in role is a nitro feature tho
screenshot your /info on the autoroles page for us to see
I was just wondering ways this could be achieved. Again I was In a server that implemented this exact setup, but they gave up on the community and switched it to a Call of duty server, but it was a great idea so I asked the guy about it and he said they had a custom bot for it, but he told me me to check out neatqueue
He said I was welcome to make my own server with it, he just didn‚Äôt want to do the halo scene anymore
yea that‚Äôs the only way i think it‚Äôs possible
add roles with emojis, then use /autoroles for setting up ranks
Is there a way to transfer stats from one disc account to another? This includes mmr, wins, loss, and the graph thing when I do the stats commands
U mean from one player account to a new player acc?
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible
Aw rip
Ppl discords be getting termed and stuff
how can i make it so the queue channels that are created arent numbered
i can manually do it if you give me the server name, the old account, and new one
you can use /tempchannels name
Nah it‚Äôs not big deal dw about it, thanks tho
that would be a good command to add to /migratestats
also I've been trying to put the game selection on captains only and it doesn't work either
you need to check out the autoroles page
but to change team selection use /teamselection
also your ranges need to be like: 1-500, 500-1000, 1000-1500. Otherwise with your current setup, someone with 499.5 MMR won‚Äôt have a rank
besides that look fine
ahhhhhhhh
I'll have to fix it tomorrow
thanks
I've done that and put it to captains only but it come up with all the options still
are you editing the right queue?
yeah
it shows in /info somewhere as well
is it because captains has random voting 2 highest 2 lowest?
how do I make it captains voting only
oh /captains selection
ahhhhhh thank you so much
what is MMR variance
i want mMR change to vary from 24-30 with an average of 27
or 25-29
what command
check out the calculator in the docs
for /mmr variance
but setting ur mmr change to 27 should be enough
hey, in my server we have 2 queue's, and we want to know how we can have 1 role (per rank) for both queues
The way I have it setup right now makes it so that if you rankdown in 1 queue, it takes that role
Or rankup in 1 queue
<@145305657237700608> do I know you from somewhere
/autoroles
I have the autoroles setup
I now have 3 roles, 2 for the 2 queues, and 1 main one which is hoisted on the sidebar
How do I make it so that the top one of the 2 queues assigns the one for the main one
if you have the same autorole set up in different queues, then the role will be managed independently in each queue
the queues should have the same name so that stats are shared between them so it wouldn‚Äôt matter
what docs
https://docs.neatqueue.com
bro teh calculator
is too mathematical
im not a genius bro
how can i work that
<@145305657237700608> i dont understand the calculator, i just want to make a MMR system, where players:
- recieve +25 mmr when winning a game,
- lose -12 mmr when losing a game
- gain +7 mmr when being the mvp of a game
I want the +25 mmr to be varied (from 23-27, but i want losing a game to ALWAYS be -12.
i want the mvp mmr to be varied too, based on how many votes they have
more votes = higher mmr given
maximum being 9
minimum being 5
if the mvp thing isnt possible thats fine
mmr variance is all or nothing, not different for wins or losses
you can change the wins and losses amount, but not the variance
and the MVP bonus mmr is a static value, it doesn‚Äôt change
Ok ok thats fine aswell
but is the variance based on anything
or is it random
well ig ill make the MVP bonus mmr feature a request
and how do i actually do the thing
in calculator
what mmr variance do i need
nothing in the mmr equation is random
it‚Äôa all based on your mmr vs own your teams mmr and the enemy teams mmr
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i understand
what is y?
in the equation, y is the MMR change for the winner
/mmr change set amount:25 loser_mmr:12 static:False
ive used that command
but for some reason
the team that won a PUG
gained 33 MMR
when in the calculator
it said it should always be 25
cause the winners team and losers team
both had 100 MMR
it shouldnt have been varied
Are you sure you changed the mmr variance?
but i think
the problem is
look
is m_{losermmr} and p_{winnermmr} the TOTAL mmr of the teams
or the AVERAGE
everything is an average
also have to account for the streak and placement  multipliers
Ohhh
Can we get rid of asking if teams balanced and also let the bot just randomly pick the map for us instead of voting?
sorry for the word.. but these are just tests üôÇ
and even when i have set the winner of the first round, what to do to start second one? Channels are freezed and actually nothing happened üôÇ
I have them off
but for some reason
when i tested this
with 100 MMR average vs 100 MMR average
the winner recieved 35.4 MMR
instead of
Is there a way to load a configuration for my queue when I didn't save the code myself?
we forgot to extend the premium and 3 of my queues got completely reset
If someone has the code you can load it
If you never did /save, then it‚Äôs impossible to get it back
For teams use /reshuffle and disable it
For maps, do /map selection and put Random
1090225942762373150 I just need the config for this queue, that's the only one I couldn't find a previous save rn
last time NeatZ gave me the configs
1086059560759988305 this one too*
But did u ever hit /save for that queue?
I'm pretty sure I did, or otherwise it saved itself when I closed it
I also asked for a way to retrieve these codes myself but that feature was planned for the future
Im sure neatz can give it a look to search ur codes, i can do it too but im not 100% sure where this codes are saved
How did u set it up?
don soap
i think my problem
when i tried making a global leaderboard
i made 2 queues
the same name
and that bugged out
the MMR system
yup gotta make sure you are editing the right queue
/reshuffle for disabling the teams thing, and change your /map selection
oh don soap answered already nvm
when a queue is force ended, it says the queue config in the channel
alright thank you so much <:pepe_love:1002056414644142110>
okay thnaks!
this should now work ig.
Some mods sent a message with a code but we're not sure which channel was that from, and I can't seem to find that message anywhere now
in the channel the queue was ended it would send it there
Reshuffling should be disabled
otherwise i can try and lookup the queue when i‚Äôm free tonight
Yes please, cause I'm pretty sure that queue saved message gets deleted or just doesn't appear for everyone apparently
someone must‚Äôve manually deleted it
I'm making sure I'll save those codes after this
it definitely wouldn‚Äôt get deleted by the bot
Then someone must have deleted it
If you can lookup the config tonight would be great thank you
oh okay ü•≤
//tournament create name:xxx team_size:1 number_of_teams:20 and then started it with like 5 teams
seems something happened with the tournament since it started with way less players
tournaments are barely tested so not surprised it broke
I see, so if there are more teams it will more likely work?
or if you changed the number of teams to be 5, i would hope it would work
oh, how can I change the number of teams while the one tournament is already running?
or you mean re-setting its options?
you can use /numberofteams but i believe it will reset the teams
i see thanks a lot üôÇ
is there someway to force join a member or members?
/player add
any news about this?
How do I stop a que once it is done
I have it started but can't figure out how to stop it
Stop a match u mean?
No a que
I got the que working but can't close it out in my thread
Why would u want to close it
You will need to do it again
Cause I only need it 2 time a month
u can do /lock instead if u want
It locks the queue so no one can join
So u don‚Äôt end it
Oh ok
But you can end it by /endqueue if u want to know
An I just restart it when it is needed
Just do /unlock when u need it üëåüèª
Thank you
i can do it soon
what‚Äôs the channel id?
1090225942762373150 and 1086059560759988305
These ones
How do i get the prompt to cancel or pick a team or tie?
In my server its all there but ina dif server it isnt and i wanna enable it
how do I activate this bot in my server? it's not working
/staffchannel u mean?
Do /setup
tried that already but the bot is not poppin. alrd gave perms to the specific channel and still aint working
What perms u gave to the bot?
Also giving perms for just a channel i think it won‚Äôt work at all
can i auto role to someone who is first in a leaderboard?
/autoroles topplayers
Yep it would be a good command
BFDZF HXQAB and MRTWL XZITK
i found 2 codes for each
ty so much
Hello, I got a bit of a problem, we've been playing, some games it comes to 0+ mmr, first time happened earlier today
Is there any commands to fix it?
what is your mmr variance?
100 mmr
no the /mmr variance
Is the change variance? It's on deffault, 1600
did you set an mmr ceiling?
those are the only 2 reasons i could see
How do I restart it?
use /mmr ceiling
Now is disabled
Then, now there must be poitns without any problems right?
should be good yea
Thanks!
how do i make it
so players cant queue
unless a host
allows it
or starts
either lock the queue or change the /misc startwhen
I'd like to set up map voting for a best of 3 but the game modes will never change first map will always be hardpoint, the second map will always be search and destroy and third will be control. is there a way to set up specific maps for specific game modes?
certain maps are only played on certain game modes
how would I go about setting that up and setting the game modes up?
In /map add you have the option to add gamemodes
how do I make it to where the best of 3 is always the same 3 game modes? please
and thank you for the above
currently you can‚Äôt set an order
what you can do is add all your maps, play a match and vote for each of the gamemodes in the correct order, then change the /map selection gamemode_choice:Least Frequent
so it will repeat the same order
thank you so much
huh?
is there a way to reset my decay settings?
is it possible to make different options appear on votes based on the result of a previous vote?
u mean on voting menus?
default is 10 MMR after 604800 seconds
Is it possible to have captains on but only to choose map selection and leave the teams as random?
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible
I can`t use the dashboard, I have to do something more?
Yeah I accidentally did /mmr delay or whatever it was
And added an extra 2 weeks to everyone
how can I delete queues? when the channel has been deleted üôÇ
Did you log in?
queues are deleted when a channel is deleted usually, what are you seeing?
I have to find it again lol, it has been awhile that I used the bot
what is this??
i can‚Äôt see stats or leaderboards
Someone needs to vote on the page to access the stats or leadearboard
yes, I login > dashboard and show how much credits and the expiration date of my sub
is there a way to change the team name into the players name?
/teamnames captains
It will put captains as team name
??? ü•π
dont think its possible
at least from what i know
no thats not possible, although having captains in non-captain selection is an interesting idea
as an option
That would be cool. The way I have it now, we want teams to be selected by the bot, but we don't want to see the whole lobby voting on the map bans. Have 1 person from each team pick the bans would be less chaotic.
IS there a way
is there a way
to make
temporary roles
for people that are queued
so i dont have to ping everyone
to join the queue
annoying the people that are queued
`/autoroles inqueue`
thanks
Thanks
ik this isnt a neatqueue feature
since the non queuers
and queuers
both ahve the same role
[@ranked PUG player]
is there a way
for me to ping
the ranked pug players
who dont have the queuer role
i dont think so
as in
in a simpler way
can i
disabled
pings
fully
for a role
even if i ping another role that a player has
wait
ill try explain in a minute
im doing something
now i can explain
Im asking
whether i can disable
pings
for people
who have a role
so if they have
Ranked pug player role
and another person
has ranked pug player role
AND Q
ueueing
and i ping @ranked pug player
the person with queueing wont get ping
i understood what you meant, im not sure if thats possible
is there a way
to ask this question
in a more understandable way
english is nmot my first language
so i can ask it to google
i dont think its possible at all, when someone has role mentions enabled, they get the notification if any of their roles are mentioned
any help?
about to hold a big even but suddenly this started to occur
i gave bot admin perms as a temp solution so we can run out event
still didnt work
<@145305657237700608>
it must be missing perms somehow
it has everything
i think
something is missing
the error came from discord directly
probably a category override?
"Please join in the channel"
Players will be removed in 2 hours


How can I decrease this time?
`/lobbychannel timer`, default is 5 mins
You cannot join a new queue during a match setup!

how to cancel this and all players can join now?
`/cancel` or `/outcome cancel`
thanks!
guys, one more question, can i set a role which can avoid channel joining restrictions?
you can add a /spectatorrole if you want people to join voice channels
well.. doesnt seem to work :/
wdym
I've added the specatotr role and the person with it cent join the channel
thats the role, the channel setup is actually baxic
you added the role with the command?
and tried a new match?
ive added with the command but havent tried new match
maybe thats why
yea it doesnt update existing games
Hello, Is it possible to download the ranked list in Excel?
Is it possible to see the change who stood out the most in the week?
you added 2 weeks grace period to everyone?
you can use the APIs or look at the network requests on the leaderboard page to get the data
its JSON though, not excel formatted
i added it to an @player role which everyone has
can u make it
if the game cancels
people in vc
get auto moved
to a vc
another vc
after typing '/' 
to see available bots command...
I cant find neatqueu bot commands in some channels... and can be only used in others, even tho they have the same perms and also one of the challenges that i cant use the commands in is the queue channel when we setup the bot... so im sure he have perms to see and manage messages at least in that channel
<@145305657237700608>
use the same command but add a negative value this time
set a /lobbychannel set
how must be hiding the commands in that channel, i can‚Äôt recall how
it‚Äôs a discord permission
thanks for letting me know
hello, does any one know what shoud i type here ?
can u make it so
the autoroles inqueue feature
also removes some roles
For example:
I want to ping people for a pug
the people that are pinged are called @Ranked pug players
However
when someone enters the queue
They recieve the role
@Queueing...
in order for me
to not ping
the people that are queueing
i want to make it
so it removes a role
from them
when they queue
1. People who are not queued are pinged (@RANKED PUG PLAYER)
2. People who joined the queue recieve a role (@Queueing...)
3. People who joined the queue lose a role (@RANKED PUG PLAYER)
4. Now when i ping @ranked PUG PLAYER, it doesent notify the already queued people
click back into the format box and it‚Äôll give you an example, like - [$]
sounds like you want /autoroles notinqueue
tried but nothing apears, shoid i just type - [$] ?
sure
okay thank you
wdym no
that way only people not in the queue have the RANKED PUG PLAYER
do you know why the rating in nick names is like this? how can i fix it to be only 1 bracket with the player current elo
might be an issue with negative MMRs
hmmm shoud i try to set the lowest mmr to 0
might fix it for now
i‚Äôll note down to take a look at it though
alright thank you so much
Why does the bot bug out on page 1
I go to page 2 for leaderboard and its fine i can see it
But page 1 goes blank
And like lags
Its weird
Discord leadearboards aren‚Äôt really good
U always have the website option! /leaderboardconfig shorturl
right click the image and open in browser
if that work fine, then it‚Äôs a discord issue
but yea overall the discord image leaderboard is buggy
Yea discord is weird ab that stuff
it‚Äôs mostly cuz of rate limits with editing messages
I keep getting interaction failed when I try to customize a queue channel
Is it possible that autroles dont work, if they are not in order  could this cause the bot to take away the role?
If I want to create instead of TEAM 1, TEAM 2  I want the name of the players does the command work $user ? ( team name should be player name)
order does not matter
that is not supported no
you want the captains to be the team name?
We have a 1 vs 1 server
so the team name is the players name
if its a 1v1, the default team names are the player names
okay so if I changed the team names already in Team 1, Team 2, I cant go back=
I must reset the entire queue?
you can do `/teamnames` again
Thank you, I will try
in the upcoming days I will be asking many questions
sorry in advance
Is it possible to start 2 different queues in one text channel?
nope
I tried is it possible that it takes some time to update?
it won't update existing matches if thats what you mean
cause it said it updated it but it didnt
is it possible that the fact that I put during match setup that it is random? so there is no captain selection?
I am confused
team selection doesnt matter
as long as you do `/teamnames set`
I see
that was my issue
I set Teamnames captain
thank you <:thisisfine:1128496721052307456>
hmm i thought if it wasn't captain selection that wouldnt do anything
I think this might be a bug->
Duplicated lobbies
Visual bug or no
did both matches actually happen?
Yea one closed one was left open
Am I safe to force delete the channel?
if the match is done sure
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to extend team selection time?
its a minute by default but when theres new players it often goes wrong
`/timer votes `
ty goat
setup isn't running
i did /setup but nothing happened
how can I disable MMR? and set up just wins as points?
will the bot always show certain points for mmr?
u gave the right perms to the bot?
but nothing's happening
hi <@648635725964902411> can u help me out with something?
look, whenever a match is ended the results come in the same channel as the queue system has been made in, any fix for this?
can anyone help me setup?
<@145305657237700608>
can u show how do you send the command?
also how do I remove someone's "MMR"
like i was testing and i have some mmr, i want to remove my mmr and other friends' too
yeah its supposed to do that
oh okay
u can change it
how do I
/resultschannel
/add mmr, and to remove input negative numbers
Tysm!
sure
<@648635725964902411>
nothings happening tho
hi <@648635725964902411> could you help me out on how I could setup the leaderboards so it shows the ones who have the most mmr?
missing perms
that‚Äôs how the leaderboard works already
or /resetstats
which perms?
send messages
that‚Äôs why nothing appears
and it can‚Äôt even send an error in the channel
i mean, when i do /leaderboard it just says there needs to be a queue running
do you have a queue created?
the error message should explain everything
it says i need a queue
so everytime i need to check the leaderboards, ill need to have a queue?
yes you need a queue
you shouldn‚Äôt be ending the queue
just leave it open
has those perms but still nothing's happening
sorry but kinda confusing, why do I need to have a queue open for everything, so basically i need to have the ticket opened at all times?
cuz you can have a bunch of different leaderboards, without a queue the leaderboard won‚Äôt know what to show
you should have dedicated queue channels
ah i see
<@145305657237700608> perms given still its the same
u checked the category perms?
i have kept the bot role on top
if the bot doesnt send any messages theres something overriding the bot¬¥s perms
it says starting queue setup but then nothing happens
U need to check everything then
That‚Äôs perms overriding
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> how do i remove wins and losses for players
/add win, and /add loss,  negative numbers for decrement
TY ü´°
how I can edit this tags? I just need to tag 1 moderator
this msg show when the queue complete and the players have to select type of team
it will automatically ping all players, spectator roles, and staff roles
Is there a way to disable @.here and @.everyone when a new tqueue text channel is created? I set the permissions but it defaults back to normal.
those wouldn‚Äôt be reset i don‚Äôt imagine
it would just be the default
how to lower the time that inactive players will be removed?
i want to lower from 5 mins --> 2 mins
I think you do this with /timer
/lobbychannel timer
How do I add maps to neat queue?
/map add
<@648635725964902411> , Iam trying to setup a neatQueue can you help me out? I have few doubts?
how to change default queue configuration?
how to add particular game?
Do /setup
You can go trough customization, check the docs: https://docs.neatqueue.com/
<@145305657237700608> I don't know why, but my votingmenu doesn't show up. It's in my /info but it's just not popping when it needs to. Am I doing something wrong or am I missing something ?
what is your config if you /save
Give me a min
Is being in test mode a problem?
Like are the votingmenu hidden in test mode ?
no that wouldnt matter
Oh ok
QHUWB
It wasn't showing the hero menu, although I don't know what is the menu because that was the first time I was using it but it wasn't working either
you set "Force Random"
so it randomly picks instead of showing the menu
Oh I thought that meant after like 30 seconds, it was forcing the votes on them. Misunderstood that part
nah that happens anyways after the vote timer
All right, thanks for lighten me up
this is just like a shortcut way to add random option selection
How can i set the default mmr to 0 for everyone that enters
`/startingmmr`
I think my server is broken, i went from 0 to 1066 mmr in 1 game.
I need help to configure
well the default mmr is 1000 by default
you probs started at 1000
Can you help me inside my server? dm?
i like to keep support in this server for visibilities sake
I want to create an system, where its 1v1, the results go on an private channel for me to vote and manage their mmr
is that possible?
and i want the queue to open at certain hours of the day, if possible
For queue to open you do /queue lock and unlock, you can program it
The channel is private for the ones who are playing and staff
How do i make it so every match is 
Win= +40
Lose= -20
`/mmr change set`
how do i turn off vc making
when a match starts
/ voicechannels mode mode:Disabled
/mmr change set 40? 
for this?
Win= +40
Lose= -20
/mmr change set 40 and optional options lose 20, put it true on static
THANKS
How do i make if i have streaks 1+ wins, i get +20?
like, when having streaks always win +20
If im an admin, how do i register other people?
And i still set the mmr change to 40 and this happens ‚¨áÔ∏è  
@momento
+146.9 (1500)
Henri
@Henri -20.0
U set static to true?
Yes!
Happened again, i won 800 the other guy lose 20
Looks like the streak multiplier
How do i disable
I want the streak to be always +20 only
like i win +40
i win second time +40 streak +20 = +60
/ mmr multipliers streaks toggle:Disable, to disable
Do i / set streak for every role?
im not that familiar with streaks or multipliers to be honest, neatz can help instead or you can read the docs
still didnt work, ill try other things
Streak it‚Äôs just a number of how many wins in a row, it won‚Äôt multiply
Yes, i want the streak to be 20, on every role
can i not get premium w paypal?
How can i manage players elo when an match finishes

they can boost them self through the rankings
Just set the /winnermessage results to staff only
wdym you want the streak to be 20
Win= +40
Lose= -20
Streak= +20
you can‚Äôt customize the streak multiplier, only turn it on/off
and for some reason this doesnt work /mmr change set 40 and optional options lose 20, put it true on static
not currently, the payments are through stripe
Its supposed to + 40 not +800
How can i fix this
not sure what you changed to get that
Its been an hard problem i tried everything
use the command again and retry a match
So my max mmr is 1500 right
And only on this match it did the correct results i wanted
okay
do you have multiple different queue channels
only one
Also im stuck here
If im the staff, how do i put the winner of the queue
use /outcome
or set a /staffchannel
Still didnt work
Its still +800
what‚Äôs ur config /save
this?
config works fine for me
makes me think you have 2 different queues or something
It doesnt work at all for me
Only have 1 queue
something is broken, defenitly not related with queues since it worked for you
how do i change the results channel
not the results that can be reverted
just that shows the outcome of matchews
/ resultschannel
i can try more tomorrow, but a config code is an exact copy of the queue settings, so unless you have a different queue i‚Äôm not sure what else could be wrong
didnt work
Could be roles since it won‚Äôt copy the other servers roles obviously
U tried another game?
i guess role multiplier?
that‚Äôs true
why wont the queue in my server set up games? the game mode is for 1v1, and when 2 people are in queue, no match is made
and both of the players who tested should still be at the default starting mmr
what queue type are you using?
Try /staff channel
Ill try that tommorow
matchmaking
if the players are actually within the range, then maybe the bot doesn‚Äôt have perms to create the match
I think I may have solved it. will be testing it again tomorrow so I will let you know if the issue arises again
If you just want to when a queue fills with 2 people and start the 1v1 you should change your queue type to pugs
Would there still be mmr?
I will test what I have tomorrow, and try that if it‚Äôs still not working then
Matchmaking queue type will search 2 people with a certain mmr range to start
Pugs will automatically start when the queue fills up
So check it out if u want to
Thanks
<@648635725964902411> , how can I remove "are captains valid" polling?
/reshuffle
i think it works for captains too
thats an premium feauture i cannot change  i think?
No it‚Äôs not
found the solution, /mmr multiplier remove "role"
How can i  register other people if im admin?
Yeah that‚Äôs what i thought
currently there isnt a way to force a `/register` for another person
Is there a way for the mmr appear next to their ign?
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=show-mmr-in-name
It appears this when i try "/ratinginname format format: [$] location:Suffix
i did the toggle enabled too
if nobody had the nickname yet, that makes sense
How do i put an nickname?
what is the issue?
if you toggled, it says in the message that it will nickname people when they queue
Well, it worked, but since im the admin it didnt put the mmr in my nickname
do i put the role higher?
if you are the server owner, it won't be able to nickname you
Okay, is there an way to nickname me?
Thank you for all the support. you really work hard on this server
no its not possible for a bot to nickname the owner
and thx!
the first place got banned from discord, how I can remove him from de leaderboard?
`/rolerequirement @everyone`
maybe that should be the default as well
what if a /refresh leaderboard command triggers that one instead
could be kul
cuz the leaderboard is kinda always refreshed, the leaderboard data isn't stored
ah i see
so by default it just looks at all the stats for the server, sorts them, then caches them in memory for a while
thanks!!!
so my 1v1 queue still is not working. and I swapped the queue type to pugs as well, and it says it requires 6 people. so it is not setting up the match it seems. any help?
U need to set teamsize to 1
it actually had to do with the number of lobbies I set. I had it set to 3 so 6 people were required to fill the queue
I don‚Äôt understand at all what you‚Äôre trying to achieve
so I want a 1v1 queue, but I want more than 2 to be able to queue up at once. but if I have 3 lobbies, and 5 people are in queue, it seems like nobody would be able to get a match until the 6th person joins
I can invite you to the server if you want to look at it real quick
you shouldnt be changing the number of lobbies then
if you set it to 3 lobbies, it will wait until 6 people are in queue
and start them all at once
but what if say 10 people are trying to queue if the server ever got enough traction? do they have to wait for the first game to complete or will another queue pop up immediately?
nope, when a match starts, the people are instantly removed from the queue
if you have /tempchannels enabled
okay I see
so I got it working, thank you. 

one last concern though. the leaderboard does reflect everybody in the server who has queued at least once? not just those in the queue, correct?
reason why it's important in my server is because I have mmr completely hidden and the leaderboard is the only ranking you see
People with at least one game
Thanks. Is there some way to make the leaderboard exclusively display W-L-T? I don‚Äôt want players to see any MMR whatsoever.
Or does it just show the ordinal ranking of players despite what they select from the drop down?
There‚Äôs a way if you use the api and then u can customize it, but otherwise no
Is there a tutorial? Completely hidden MMR is key for the system I‚Äôm implementing.
I believe division ranks really hurt competitive integrity, and even a number (beyond a leaderboard rank) goes too far
There‚Äôs no tutorial, you can check on yt with diff apis, api is on documentation
thank you
When I set the autoroles am I supposed to count like this -> (role 1) min 1000 max 2000 ; (role 2) min 2001 max 3000; (role 3) min 3001 max 4000, etc.
or min 1000 max 2000, min 2000 max 3000 , etc.
like this
What are peak mmr commands?
can help for setup for 5v5 scrim
the bot dont show the message to vote  for winner
can I do something to force end or force to show?
did you change the /winnermessage results?
you can use /outcome to fix
wdym?
aways was for staff vote
i try the outcome selectwinner but show a msg "canot find the channel, maybe deleted?"
staff vote means the message won‚Äôt appear
is the channel deleted?
the channel is not deleted
im from staff
How can I have a  channel with only the leaderboard?
/link then /leadearboard
if I want to delete the leaderboard, it is enough to delete message?
How long does it take to change the result channel?
That‚Äôs automatic when the match ends
Valorant code with all maps added + anonymous queue: AIPMK  this code is working or no ?
<@648635725964902411>
i would imagine it is, i havent tried though
Works for me
okey can test it
How create comnd for leaderboard
/leaderboard
Ohhh yeah I remember that
Mine just fixed itself idk how tho lmao
it tells you what you need to do
it fixed cuz someone followed what it says to do
Nah even when I did follow it its was bugged for a bit then later on it fixed itself
Is there a fix or command that brings the Queue message back to the bottom of the channel. It sometimes doesn't auto drop down and the only solution I had was to end queue and reload it.
That‚Äôs by default
It sometimes get bugged
Is it possible to set up the bot in a way that, when a lobby is created, a timer is initiated for setting up a vote for the win conditions? Additionally, if one person doesn‚Äôt vote within the specified time, can the bot automatically allocate the win to the person who has cast their vote?

This feature would greatly streamline our processes and ensure that games or decisions are resolved efficiently, even in cases where not everyone participates in the vote.

I‚Äôd appreciate your guidance on whether this configuration is feasible and how we can implement it effectively.
/timer matchcleanup, is a command for setting the time before a game is force finished
also setting up the voting to majority will work
when people try and do anything with neatqueue it says msg not dilivered
could you share a screenshot?
it fixxed itself
alright i have a couple of questions
if i have the mmr change set to 100, when people progress more mmr, do they lose more and gain less?
depending on the mmrs of the other players
so if the match is fair, lets say something crazy like 5000 vs 5000
the mmr change will be the same as if it was 1000 vs 1000?
correct
okay
so is there a way to sync mmr across all channels?
for example, i want a 1v1 queue channel, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5. but i want all of the mmr to be synced, so your mmr is the same in the 1v1 and 5v5 if you play a match in the 1v1 or in the 5v5
you just have to name all the queues the same
ohhh okay okay
bot started making channels on top of the channel list rather than its normal category any fix? <@145305657237700608>
hey how do i remove the que if i added it to the wrong chatroom?
why did a queue stop working
stats are not showing up for the right queue
and no one can queue anymore
is it still happening? if so, what server?
yea it still is
use /save, then /endqueue, then /load in the new channel
bet thank you!
can u give some more info, what is happening
discord.gg/nack
its also just kicking everyone out queue if someone doesn't join vc
its never done that before
im restarting the node, it happens occasionally
someone mustve ended the queue
can i restart w/o the stats getting reset?
you would need to recreate the queue or load the config code if you have it
if you give me the channel ID, i can look it up
where can i find the channel id?
if you enable developer options, you can right click and Copy Id
1150509041504759868
try `/load WSBSS`
thank you
How do I change the number of players in an already created queue?
for example from 10 to 14
I want to leave GK with 2 and linha with 14
`/roles`
Hi <@145305657237700608> , How do i remove the captain voting feature? As some players are not familiar with this feature at the moment. We just added the NeatQueue bot to our server! Great job btw üëçüèΩ
Also we are experiencing a black image when trying to prompt the leaderboard.
how many games can be played at the time?
i mean ... if one game will  be played rn can a 2nd game start aswell?
you can change your /teamselection
as for the leaderboard, that just means there is no data
yup no limit on concurrent games
kk good to know üòÑ
how can set mmr and rest for started all player 50 elo
U mean reset stats for everyone, and the set the starting mmr to 50?
If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking for, do, **/resetstats all**, and then **/starting mmr set**, put 50 and the role everyone or the role you want to
is not work
/resetstats all
If there a way to prevent a player joining multiple queues at the same time?
That‚Äôs by default
We are seeing players join on multiple queues
what‚Äôs wrong with that?
you can‚Äôt be in 2 matches at once still
it‚Äôll kick them when a match starts
Great!
So it does it automatically
What happens then? Does both matches get canceled?
if someone is in 2 queues and the first queue starts a match, they will be removed from the second queue
nothing gets cancelled
Clear.
Is there a way to prevent a player from joining 2 queues at the same time ? Like if he joined one he gets removed from the other.
no there is not
<@145305657237700608> hi can help me for set mmr for win and lose and start mmr ?
Hey <@145305657237700608> 
Amount of MMR here should be positive or negative number?
If you say the penalty is 10, then the player will lose 10 MMR
you can use `/mmr change set`
how can I delete a team?
`/party disband`
Hey <@145305657237700608> 
Can you check if there any autolocks \ autounlocks for NAVINATION server?
If yes, can you remove them?
You can do it
Do / lock all:True auto_lock:False repeat:False, then /unlock all: True, im sure it will override the previous config, i don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a better way
Will try, ty
for a mmr multiplier, i wanted to make it where server boosters receive a 25% mmr boost. if i use /mmr multiplier set, and give them the 1.25 multiplier, does that also mean that they have a 1.25 losing multiplier as well as a 1.25 winning?
nope it only applies to wins
awesome, thank you
and then also, if i have another role that receives a 1.10 boost lets say, and someone has both roles, will they receive the total multiplier, which would be 1.35? or do they just receive one of the multipliers
they will get whatever multiplier is higher
got it okay
can i make it that a person that is still in a match is not able to join a new queue?
That‚Äôs by default
can i cancle a queue?
a person got queued twice in 1 game
/cancel
<@648635725964902411>
can i get help setting up the bot for my server
im a bit confused on how to set up where the bot takes the players from
wdym?
if i have 10 people io a call and we all join the queue, i would want the bot to drag everyone into another party
i think i found it but its not letting me pick the channel
you can automatically drag all players to the queue voice channel via /lobbychannel pullall
thanks
also how do i take roles out
it says to omit but doesnt give me an option
for what command
and when it says omit, just don‚Äôt even add the option
one more thing how do i change the amount of people that can join the queue
/ teamsize
But it depends on what type of queue you have
nope that fixed it
O aight
is it normal for the bot to dm saying that im banned for queue
for one hour on test mode
is there any way i can take off the ban
you get banned for not showing up, in test mode you dont have as much time to join the voice channel, you can use /player unban
thanks again
i was using test mode and it created 2 queues idk why
did you set /numberoflobbies to 2?
probably
just changed it
i changed it to 1 but its still doing it
on test mode
screenshot?
how can i check the current state of some setting
for example let say we did add/remove some maps
and know i just wanna check the current map pool
or i want to check the current map_selection mode
if it is random or vote or ....
is it possible?
/info
Thanks
if someone mistakenly ended the queue
and the message that appears with the config code got deleted...
could we somehow get it back from somewhere else?
as of two days ago, yes
with /config list
okey thanks
Is there a way to make mvp votes seperate from overall votes bc i cant vote for myself as mvp and since i have it set to mvp required id be forced to vote for someone else as mvp making it so nobody gets the mvp bc votes conflict making me have to manually add the elo and mvp award using commands everytime we play a match (my server we try to forve mvps and give extra elo for them)
So like mvp votes being like 2-3 and the match being 3-4
im gonna change it where the MVP is auto selected after some timer
is it possible to set certain roles to be able to have admin permissions with the bot, or do they have to have the Administrator setting on for their role
/staffrole add
thanks
also the default required perm is manage channels, not administrator
Im loading hte config : TCEMEA
but for some reasons
when testing to join the queue
it asked for a required role
which i never eneabled
and after checking /info... I found  'None'
but still cant queue
if its from a different server that could happen i suppose
do `/rolerequirement add @ everyone`
having an issue where we have 6/6 on the queue but it does not auto create voice channels and pull members to those channels. any ideas?
we have the following settings:
team size 3
team number 2
4 maps
confused because the bot has server admin priveleges
Did you disable voice channels?
no, is it disabled by default?
let me see if there is an enable command
It‚Äôs enabled by default
Just do /voicechannels mode
To required
okay, that might have worked, but now its giving me the "select team to queue" argument
did u start a party?
or the queue type is full team vs full team?
hm, so before I saw this, I used the startfromvc command and it bypassed the select team to queue argument
then it pulled everyone to a newly created vc, and then team setup was started in a newly created text channel.
wondering if ive missed something here
this works for my intended use, but still curious
thanks for your help on the voicechannel command, i missed that
i‚Äôm not totally following what happened
is there a way to copy paste a queue?into another  channel?
/config save and /config load
if I modify the second queue will it modify the config aswell?
my roles are not working
That‚Äôs games
Not mmr?
Or bronze doesn‚Äôt work either
How do I set autoroles for mmr?
Ohhh
I saw my mistake
no they aren‚Äôt linked
Is it technically feasible to implement the proposed dynamic ranked queue system, where queues close and open based on player ranks and levels, to ensure balanced matchmaking and provide a more competitive gaming experience?
1.    Join the Ranked Queue: Players of all skill levels can initially join the general ranked queue. This is where you begin your journey.
    2.    Earn Your Stripes: As you play and improve, you‚Äôll climb the ranks and strive to reach the designated level or role that marks you as a high-skilled player.
    3.    Queue Advancement: Once the required number of players achieves the target rank, we‚Äôll close the current queue for those players, ensuring they face off against opponents of similar skill.
    4.    New Challenge: A brand-new ranked queue will open up for high-skilled players who‚Äôve met the criteria. This is where the competition intensifies!
how can i make it that only team captains can ban maps?
guys i have a huge issue in my Polish 4mans serwer
we cant set up the bot to give and remove roles according to the MMR and would love if someone could join and set it up with us
it took hours and we got nowhere, and now the bot removes people just for clicking join queue, please help.
you can set up different queues for different ranks
or use the matchmaking queue type to get fairer matches
`/map selection voting`
yeah i found it already but ty
but the moment someone gets to an higher rank how can I stop him to see the other  queue?
allowing one role to queue in the next queue?
yea you should add a role requirement to each queue
Guys my issue is clear, i wanna set mmr to the three roles
Rank B 1800 Rank A 2100 MMR and Rank S being 2500
How the hell do i set up this bot to give and take those roles by itself ahhaha
`/autoroles mmr set` for each of them
yes but this is broken as hell
1800 - 2100, 2100 - 2500, 2500 - 100000
yea i wish thats how it worked on your bot sir
it is
when i wanna set it up
for example i set the minimal mmr to each
1800
ill show you
i just dont get how this works one bit
when i click this i lose all roles
and have to add them back by hand
u are saying Rank B is 1700 -> 1800 MMR
if you are losing roles, that means they must be already set up as autoroles
The way my ranking works looks like this, Rank B (Lowest Rank) is given the average of 1800 mmr and then the rankup to rank A is 2100, then rank A to rank S is 2500
Rank S being the highest Rank
Then how would i restart all settings so i can set this again?
autoroles read the players MMR, and gives them a role for it
its not giving people MMR based on their role
ah xd
you want `/startingmmr`
you can set it for each role
okay
So if i set it up
1800 mmr Rank B
2100 mmr Rank A
2500 Rank S
then how do i make them work together?
so the bot can take the roles away and give them back ?
to people accordingly to if they gained a rank or lost a rank
hello?
you use /autoroles for that
to specify what role a person should have at any given MMR
could you explain it like to a stupid person?
im not the smartest man, especially with electronics
like discord and stuff
like /autorole set mmr and how would you do it so it works
could you write out a skeleton for me so i could copy and paste it?
derank mmr for rank S is 2350
from a is 1850
and Rank B is pernament
im so sorry for troubling you sir, im just terrible at this.
`/autoroles mmr set role:Rank S lower_rating:2500 upper_rating:100000 lower_lose_rating:2350`
`/autoroles mmr set role:Rank A lower_rating:2100 upper_rating:2500 lower_lose_rating:1850`
`/autoroles mmr set role:Rank B lower_rating:0 upper_rating:2100`
probs want you want
You are an absolute life saver
For some reason ppl  cant use  /cancel and idk why
what happens
Did u disable the usage of commands
Then what happens
nothing when they use it
if they try to use it in the match info nothing happens
you mean on the match channel?
if they try to use it its not working
nvm i fixed it!
but ty xd
uhm how do u remove a queue
cause i accidently used one for my staff channel
Just /resetstats all and name that queue
Then /endqueue
can  i fix it somehow?
her mmr is  not  updating
is it just them?
did you change any settings related to ratinginname ?
i reseted all stats today only her mmr was stuck at 1046
somehow it fixed itself xd
How to save a queue so that the roles will be shown all the time
what?
save a queue is /config save
anyone know why he cant see anything? he is like the only one having this problem atm
ty worked for him
hello! How do I get people to see the queue? The channel is private and people who are not in the queue cannot enter. And I want people to be able to come and watch
/channel restrictions
I put disabled but it doesn't work
you can add a /spectatorrole
thank you! but they still cannot enter due to the limit of people in the room. How would that be changed?
that should be removed with a spectatorrole added
okay
thank you!!
How can i prevent a player from leaving the queue after matchmaking has started ?
Not possible
Unfortunately. I believe it‚Äôs a great functionality if it could be added.
However, we have multiple queues in different team sizes and wanna know if i can prevent a player from joining more than one queue at the same time?
<@648635725964902411>
There‚Äôs no command for that, when a queue starts it will make the user leave the other ones
is there anyway to backup ign to discord username mapping?
wdym backup?
before reseting all stats that resets igns
if you do `/resetstats all` it won't wipe the IGN
you know how you use /set ign account:gameacc#1331 user:@discorduser
i did some reset before and all igns were gone, dont remember which one
it has to be stored somewhere in db? the mappings account:gameacc#1331 user:@discorduser
i dont believe the IGNs would be removed
is there a way to view it, or back it up? perhaps via api?
it would appear in here: https://api.neatqueue.com/docs#/default/allplayerstats_api_playerstats__server_id__get
itll be alot of data though
so im like brandnew with this bot so i asked a person on how to use it he told me to ask support so here i am
so yeah how to set the bot properly
/setup
ok then?
bruh
lmao i figured it out
It literally guides u tho
Hey, while trying to use /register for valorant in my channel it says "Error fetching your Valorant rating. Make sure the account is formatted correctly!". I don't find any information about the right format in the documentation. So what's the format to register the Valorant account? I tried different aproaches but nothing worked
Name#1234 doesn‚Äôt work?
Also it won‚Äôt work if your acc doesn‚Äôt have rank in valorant i think so
is the account NA as well?
It's an EU Account
So this feature doesn't work for EU or any other Region besides NA?
The current API i use is for NA, let me see if they have an equivalent
That would be awesome
could you give me the example you were trying so i can test?
TGM headshinsky#7478
is there any way to force balanced every time and not have people vote for captain, randoms, etc?
`/teamselection`
look right?
Awesome, thanks!
Is there a way to lock temp channel access so no one can chat in it so they don‚Äôt spam? We just want the temp channel to post lobby code
Hey <@145305657237700608> 
Bot is not moving people to voice channels
There‚Äôs no a exact command for that
U could change ur category settings so no one can send messages except you and some ones
bot probably doesnt have perms to move members
bot have all perms, it was temp issue
Happens with neatqueue
yep it happens
<@145305657237700608> Hey i have a question about matchmaking if you don't mind asking
Sidenote this bot is a very impressive work from you guys
hello, does anyone know what is the command for reseting the win/lose in the leaderboard
Reset for all /reset stats all, reset individually /resetstats player
Only Win lose, is /win add (negative n to decrease), /loss add (negative n to decrease)
First is /add, mb
<@648635725964902411> Can i ask a few things about matchmaking?
Yea sure
or `/set wins` and `/set losses`
Is that new
nah /set has been around forever lol
Soo i have the Matchmaking Type right, with people being able queue 1v1's into eachother based on the MMR system.

So let's say 1 person is sitting at 50 MMR, and multiple people queue up. How can i make it so that the person with 50 MMR is more likely to queue up people with 100 MMR (there could be people with 500 MMR in the queue aswell).

Would this be achieved by lowering the `/matchmaking range`, and increasing the `/matchmaking leniency` values? As far as i'm understanding it, it's basically increasing your MMR per 15 seconds until it finds the nearest match with that certain MMR.
it will start the first match it finds that fits within the matchmaking range, yes
so if the 50 MMR person has enough people within the range, then they will get the first match
Right, and there'd be a invisible number that counts that up every 15 seconds based on the `/matchmaking leniency` value correct? That explains a lot
(incrementing on the 50 MMR)
yup exactly, every 15 seconds that range will increase by the leniency
so at first, the 50 MMR player could play up to 100 MMR players, then 150, then 200, etc
if the leniency is 50
Yeahh perfect, thank you so much for explaining that. Makes a lot more sense now. I had some issues setting it up at first but i realized that i accidently set the "balancebytype" on roles instead of mmr üòÑ
Thank you for explaining that though!
to start the Queue  all players have to be in the channel how can i make it started with none in the voice
`/voicechannels mode mode:`
Optional or Disabled
Is there a way to prevent people from "queue sniping"? Basically 2 players could just queue up at the exact same moment, match eachother on purpose and basically trade a win with eachother
you can try using the `/anticheat` to flag players for wintrading
besides that, not really no
Okay thanks i'll check that out
Umm so, i've set it so that when a player wins a game, they receive 1 singular point. But it doesnt seem to add to the stats when the game is done. Any solutions? <@145305657237700608>
There‚Äôs a difference between points and mmr
If u do /stats for that player it doesn‚Äôt show any points?
Yeah, it doesnt. It  just stays at 0 points after approving a win.
(Mind you i have the setting saved to give 1 point per win)
It should work i guess
Yeah that's what i was hoping would work aswell
it should work, havent heard of any issue with that
It works for me
Is there a specific setting that maybe turns points off? I don't know what i'm doing wrong.
What commands have u done for points?
let me repeat find the commands, one moment
```
/points startingvalue value:0
/points floor points:0
/points change win value:1 
/points change loss value:100
```
This is my current setup for it
Hi So i have 3 Different Channels for 3 Different q's

i want a different channel where everyone can use different bot commands like leaderboard  ( which should link all 3 channels and displays everyone by mmr )

how do i do that?
if you want all the queues to have the same shared stats, you will either need to name them all the same or use `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats`
then you can `/link` to one of the queue channels and people can use commands
cool thanks
<@145305657237700608> Hello, after I make the captain selection random it doesn't save, and also the captain first pick mode how can i fix it
And i don't want a vote for how teams will be i just want it captains always
How can I change the name of a queue without resetting the stats or anything?
u need to do another one and then /migrate stats
/teamselection
Hello, I need help configuring the bot from scratch.
i need help
i have this error WSKZP
https://docs.neatqueue.com/
<@648635725964902411>  me pod√©s ayudar
Explicarme unas cosas y ya
looks like missing perms to create channels
After i make it to random it doesn't save do i need to do something to save it?
who i make sub to them  can the bot give them warn
what's mmr meaning
match making ratio
It should send a message the config has been saved
hi whats the command to enable as in the picture
It does send but after i use /teamselection again i don't see it set to random
Bc that how it works
It won‚Äôt show the config again on /teamselection
Just save the random mode
/reshuffle
yh but after i join the q i have to vote
Hmm it works for me
the bot sets 2 captains but players have to vote ?
Reshuffle its for disabling or enabling the confirm vote
If you want to captains to be random do /captain selection
And don‚Äôt use the /reshuffle
<@648635725964902411> i want this to appear everytime the queue fills out ‚Ä¶ bot balanced selection + players vote to confirm captains
<@648635725964902411> look after i made captain selection to random still need to vote
U disable that by /reshuffle
That only will appear on team selection and captain selection
If they are set to random
Got it üëçüèΩ thanks <@648635725964902411>
<@648635725964902411> , while picking players, second captain can pick two members, how to change it to 1?
how can i ping players who are in active queue (already match made)?
ping a certain queue number
/captains drafttype type:Straight (1-1-1-1)
thats not a thing currently
interesting idea though
it helps with notifying players to vote for a winner, specially when its mandatory to select a winner for a player to requeue
this is our case at least
is anybody able to help set up 1 queue and leaderboard of have a brief discription on how to do it would appreciate it.cheers
/setup then /leadearboard
/ autoroles
<@648635725964902411> how can i make captains vote  not random
/captains selection
Is it possible to add @team1 @team2 roles in queue so i can ping teams <@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608>
You just can add one
/autoroles ingame
So if i add team1 role it will be given to the players in team 1
no its not per team
there is a feature request for that, but its not implemented yet
Okay
how can i end that
captain member
disable `/partyqueue`, or just leave your parties
are you able to help me by any chance im really struggling to set this up üôèüèø
Setup is very interactive, what are you struggling with?
Any possibility to perma disable mmr in queue?
First use /link then pick the queue u want leaderborad to show then/leaderboard
Not really
You can try to just make it to no one wins any mmr
Understood, thanks
yep, setting the mmr change to 0 will disable it basically
it will just show "Winners" and "Losers", no MMR changes
<@145305657237700608> Hello friend, I have your bot in one of my discords, how do I start the queue that already exists in a channel? our friend who does this is sleeping. What is this command?
Just fill the queue
And it will automatically start
<@648635725964902411> We close the line at 4 o'clock in the morning and open it at 12 o'clock in the afternoon, but the friend who does this is not available.
<@648635725964902411> The queue was inactive for an hour and closed automatically
not sure what you mean  by "closed"
I think he means clearing the queue
<@407328382028873731>  If i am right type /timer queuereset and then setup desired time in seconds (default is 3600 = 1h)
Do /unlock
How can i change time for auto pick
auto pick?
When a captain is afk
It will auto pick for example in 5 mins
I have seen this in a server which uses this bot
`/timer votes`
Okay thx
any possibility to get some kind of archive of commands used by mods?
It should be in the audit log of the server
i guess not :/
damn
idk then
i meant especially neat commands
/logs
Bot down?
Its working
okay one more thing, as i cant see it in documentation. Any possibility to cancel the whole game (from stats (number of game, wins/losses, MMR) when its already ended? (for example when ppl trolled the bot or clicked by mistake)
`/outcome cancel`
set up a `/staffchannel`, itll give you buttons you can click
FLNMJ error code
found a bug, its fixed now
Thank you, will test
match history how can I move Match history into another text channel
/resultschannel
how can I clone a queue?
same concept as copy paste?
hey so i have 3 different places to qeueue but i need to chance something about all of them which is add  hero selection to each qeueu  how do i change them at the same time?
or can i add over 20 heros at the same time?
/config
you would need to use configs as well
how do i get rid of the role selection and add where they can like vote on maps or somthing like that
Map voting is /map add
or how do i take where you vote for captain off
To get rid off the roles is /roles and just use it without any parameters
You want captain random?
i just want it where it picks teams for me like someone doesnt pick teams
yk what i mean?
Random team selection?
/teamselection
one more thing
how do i add a game mode?
when you add a map, you can specify the gamemodes that it can be played on
im so confused could someone help?
im like vc or sm
Just set up the neatqueue bot again for a different queue
but the new setup isn't creating a new text channel like it does with the VC
does anyone know how to solve this?
normally it would ping everyone who was in queue when the game starts but it isn't doing that now either
how do i remove a queue
/resetstats all then /endqueue
/tempchannels
Thank you!
How many daily matches and players are allowed in the FREE Version?

Is there a way i can link one leaderboard to multiple queues? This will help me in implementing the ranking system
You need to name all the queues by the same name to share stats on one leaderboard
Now i have made sure everything is linked to one leaderboard, how can i implement autoroles to all my queues while not overlapping each other?
Queues with the  same name doesn‚Äôt share config
It won‚Äôt overlap
(Changing name of queue will reset stats btw, so u need to becareful and migrate stats)
Meaning that each config needs a auto role setup ?
Or is there a way to setup once for all queues/configs
‚ÄúAll queues are the same name and linked via /leaderboardconfig sharedstats
can anyone please help me setup 1 queue and leaderboard im an absolute bot at it üò¶
Having the same name doesn‚Äôt mean their config will be the same
The only way to setup autoroles once for all queues is by making one and saving the config
Then loading it
Got it. Thanks
how do i get a leaderboard link please?
/leaderboardconfig shorturl url:
How can i make MMR visible next to the user name ?
/ratinginname
how do i link 2 separate  queues to the same leaderboard?
give them the same queuename, or the same `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats`
how do i check what the queue name is lol
The queue message will say "MyGame Queue"
MyGame is the queue name
any idea what iv done wrong
the leaderboard should work for both queues i think i did it right
when i made the second queue i linked it through queue name now when i touch the leaderboard it says this
use `/link` in that channel
when you have 1 queue, all channels will automatically "link" to that queue
but now that there are 2 queues, it doesn't know which to use
what do i link it to either one of the 2 queues or can i link it to both
Hey mate was just wondering how to add a spectator role to join the voice channels without giving them the admin role for people wanting to watch the games
`/spectatorrole`
Thank you
The problem im having now is that the person is still unable to join the voice channels even with the role it says that they are locked
the role should be explicitly added to the new voice channels
have you tried with a new match?
and still just random
huh?
you didnt ask a question <:HamHuh:860243844624809994>
i had to cancel the matches
how can i make vote for captains
/teamselection
Is there a premium version that allows us to rebrand the bot?
you can customize the nickname for free, premium lets you add branding to embeds + custom language overrides
cant edit the profile pic though
How do i make a que i want to have role select  mid, jungle, offlane, adc, and support its like lol but its a different game
`/roles`
it's still choose random captians
`/captains selection`
How can i customize the bot nickname?
Just click it and change nickname
Do that in the queue channel
for every Q or just one
I think he means the main q channel where ppl join q
If u do one queue it won‚Äôt change anything since every queue has it‚Äôs own config
U need to change the /captainselecetion one by one
I guess that‚Äôs the problem
for some reason my bot stoped working
ppl cant vote or what so ever
hes coming back, someone found an issue with a queue config, fixed now
hi need help
<@145305657237700608>
<@648635725964902411> here ?
Just type your questions here
still doesn't work
The bot is not adding people to my queue ban role idk why 
He is doing it for ppl that rejoin the dc but not for ppl which created a new acc 
Min acc age needs to be 30days

Do they have to start queuing to get the role or should they get it automatically after joining the dc
only when they attempt to queue will they get the role
Ah kk ty
Well then sometimes he is not doing it
Hi, if i change the role name in dc will the auto roles accordingly change ?
yep no issue there
Hey, the question got asked a few times, but it doesn‚Äôt really work the way we want:

If one of the captains is afk, then NQ auto picks with the default time of 60 sec 
By /timer votes we changed to 300 sec (5 min). But that means that all other timers are now also set to 5 min (e.g. for voting captains or voting maps). 

Is there any possibility to disable the auto pick only for picking players?
no, currently its just one shared timer
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>
without more info we cant help
the commands we said do in fact work
can i make it that the mmr stays the same in 2 different queues?
only thing i can find is Migrate Stats /migratestats
Wdym by stays the same?
like  .... if someone plays all the time in queue 1 and i want to setup a 2nd queue he could play in can i make it that he has the same mmr in both?
either name the queues the same, or set up a shared `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats`
Kk i will try
how do i make it so when the queue pops it says join team 1 or team 2 instead of captains etc
Can you be more specific
how can you do lobby creation in a specific category?
Is there a way to make winner vote buttons show for only staff? I want to make it so you don't have to put in the command "/outcome selectwinner"
/channel category category_mode:
/winnermessage results
when I use that there isn't a vote button anymore
although I specified?
U need to specify the category mode*
okay
does it need time until it works?
What do you mean
Oh sorry, i forgot
Do /staffchannel set
It will send all queue info to that channel and u can select winners there
i set it an other category but somehow it isnt working
`/tempchannels toggle mode:Enabled`
thanks alot that was exactly what I was looking for
Hey question
the bot blocks everyone to join vc when q is on
however im trying to make a role for players to join the q
how to allow that for the bot?
like a way to tell the bot to allow this role to join the q vc to listen to comes
/spectatorrole
cool thanks
true
it's still random
not captian vote
`/captains selection`
it's still random look video
can u come to my servver to solve it
whats ur config `/save`
i don't got it
Just do /config save
oh mb
yea that command
how can i make a role ban from Q For a specific time for someone didn't come to Q for 5 minutes
Hi, is there a way to set a "flex" role which can be filled into any other role?
you need to share the config code so we can check out your settings
not currently
`/player autoban`
Queue configuration saved as: 5541
You must be doing something wrong, it works for me when i do /captain selection changes
does it matter if i use an API key provided to me rather than generating one myself? i assumed it wouldn't but got an access forbidden error despite including the header so figured i'd rule that out
I don‚Äôt know if api keys work on the ip they got generated tbh
I don‚Äôt think it would matter
Neatz can answer you
no i didn't i'm frist  write /captain selection and select vote  for captain  and start the Q
The api key needs to be generated by the bot, otherwise it cant identify you
but they aren't linked to your IP, just your discord account
so what i have to do
try `/config load MCPEJ`
i changed the setting
there is a 2 Q now
just delete the top message
ok so if someone else had generated it and i was using it in a script, that shouldn't be the point of failure?
nope that would be fine, it would just use their account
oh wait
so if that person isn't in the discord server i'm trying to query it wouldn't work i assume
right, the API token impersonates the user
gotcha well that clarifies that, is the site to generate an API token different? i'm clicking on the "generate an API token" hyperlink in the docs page but that just reroutes to the same page
its a command currently, `/webhooks generatetoken`
oh ok thanks
how do i sign up for premium for my server?
we are hitting the 500 cap
https://www.neatqueue.com
Login, then go to dashboard
<@145305657237700608> still not working
did you specify a captains role?
i got a question, why my queues name changes name after it pops
what changed?
tha name of my queue
like this, the original name was Tier 1
then it changed, maybe there is a command
what‚Äôs the new name?
the queue channel name changes via /channel name
games-1307 and it changes everytime a new game starts
the queue name is not changing srry, the text channel is changing of nam
name**
but u just mean the temp channels that are created right?
not the actual queue
that channel is new per game
so when it gets created, it will increment the name
it‚Äôs a temporary channel just for the game
actually is the general chat i create for the people to talk
in the pic i send u there is one channel which is the temporary channel and the other
<@145305657237700608>  how do i turn on Role queue?
i found it
sorry for ping
i‚Äôm not sure what you mean, it definitely doesn‚Äôt rename any channel on match start
how do I show which players are queueing for each role like this? I've already enabled roles and it works fine, but it doesn't show it like that in the queue message
no i thought u did
1 sec i'll try
How does it show?
How would he do it if he‚Äôs not in your server lul
I have roles enabled and it works just fine, it just doesn't show on the queue message
That‚Äôs a matchmaking queue
I don‚Äôt think it will display the role
I believe I managed to do it somehow when I started the queue for the first time, but after I ended it and started it again it doesn't show anymore
I might be crazy tho, I don't remember if it was set as matchmaking before
As u can see in the reference pic u sent, is not a Matchmaking queue, its a PUGs one
Okay, thanks
Its hard to understand all the commands of the bot, but is there a feature that allows for the bot to ping specific roles when a queue fills up-to a certain level?
`/autoping`
what is error code XRXFB
idk what im doing wronng
re-add your voting menu
but specify the key
it shouldnt be optional, bug
what is meaning ping
ping is @ someone/role
so i had parties disabled untill to day 
i enabled them and removied captain map and team pick but for some reason the bot is not making the map voting change to random map selection and i dont know why everytime i try to change it it will still be map voting
<@145305657237700608> neatqueue is acting up in my server, what am i suppose to do
I have a problem with the server because of the bot. I want a solution
What problem?
Can you be more specific?
/map selection doesn‚Äôt work?
My bot is slow in numbers and every time I work in vote mvp I am not satisfied
All server. Team 1 and team 2
My server team 23021
Why ÿü
Blud what happened
after this update
people arent showing up
in MVP vote
people arent auto moved to their teams
??????
I need u come my server and update in bot with my server
And Make an adjustment vote mvp
I can‚Äôt do anything, this is probably an internal issue with the bot, so we need to wait until NeatZ fixes it
it was on vote before now i put it on random and its still on vote
Can you send me your config?
Do /config save
AHVKH
when my members join the queue vc, the bot cannot indicate the players
and just queue bans for 3 min
I see what‚Äôs the issue
Having enabled map bans won‚Äôt make it random
So do /map bans 0
i see ok
And do /map selection to random again and it will be fixed
ty ^^
lets see if it works
hello
discord credit?
Did you already buy the credits?
But I get it
now for some reason the bot is putting al the queue channel  not into the right place
still?
no üòÑ
nvm there is still a lobby in the wrong place
maybe bc they are stiill playing
yep exactly
hello
i have a problem
the admin pug
didn`t work
like i add by
./staffrole add role:
and add the role but the prem didn`t work like close the pug or end or anything
huh?
if the bot is in the server, then thats a discord thing, the commands should be visible
it might be just you as well, try restarting
Hello, can I transfer the premium to another server?
I used premium on the test server and now I want to transfer it to the main server
sure i can manually do it, what is the old server ID and the new server ID
i missclicked and deleted the queue join xd how can i get it back ? üòÑ
the queue message to join?
if u type in the channel of the queue it will appear
xD ty
hey <@145305657237700608>  it doesnt seem like i can buy the credits atm

also for the last option whats all the extra stuff i get?
it includes the same stuff in the basic tier
is there a guide for the "Includes extra customization to the queue message, as well as customizing all the bot's phrases."
no guide, but the premium commands are `/queuemessage` and `/language overrides`
how do i turn on <#915812742865231912> ?
use `/roles`, and change your `/queuetype` to "Select Team On Join"
cool
and how do i delete all of these configs
dont think u can delete them
it just shows the 10 recent configs
yep configs last forever
is there a way i can set up differnt mmr for a rank
so for example

someone can be Tank 100 mmr and someone else can be tank 200mmr
and other players can be support 100 mmr and etc based on the roles/mmr
does that makes sense?
makes sense yea, but thats not currently a feature
rip, but thanks for the help! u been helping a ton!
is it possible to query the API using a basic urllib request or will i need to do something more advanced than that? i tried just doing a standard HTTP request module generating my URL and passing my auth header but have been getting an access 403 error
you can make the request with anything
some library, postman, curl, whatever
weird, even doing curl in my terminal, i got an access forbidden error, not sure what it is
i noticed the IP the browser "try it out" executions communicate with is different from what a script communicates with, could that cause an issue?
The auth header you are using has staff permissions in the server?
make sure the header is attached
it has every staff permission but isnt the highest role in the server (though it has the admin perm and all)
when i was doing script url request, i passed the header correspondingly, not sure how i'd do that via curl i just straight copied the command generated in the API docs
i can't end the Q
The channel must have been deleted before?
it's auto delete
auto delete?
The channel won‚Äôt auto delete unless the voting is done
there's no vote  the is for only staff
and i'm onle the staff
and i was a way  and the channel was  embte empty for a long time
thats why i would recommend allowing players to vote for the winner
but if the channel was deleted, you cant select a winner anymore
the match was deleted
so they can't joing another Q without voting or no
by default, yes
Hi, how can i prevent certain role from using certain command or allow only certain role to use a command?
for example start queue
You would have to add a staff role, but then hide all other staff commands via the Server Integration settings
How does draft type hybrid works? 1-1/2-1-1
Team 1 picks 1 player
Team 2 picks 1 player
If Team 2 has a lower average MMR than Team 1, then Team 2 picks again, otherwise, Team 1 picks
So it would take average of two players in team 1? as team 1 captain had one turn only
yea, the 2 players
Got it üëçüèΩ
Thanks üôèüèΩ
Is there a way to clear 1 person out of a queue
So if somebody is afk you dont have to full clear the entire queue
/player remove
how do we disable a command for players
theres a command /ping and players r using it to see the players in the queue when theyre not meant to be able to
hey, i used to be able to do this, but if I want a queue that is meant for 8 people (2 4man teams) but I want to set it to 9/10 people how do I do that? This would mean 1-2 people wont be picked
<@145305657237700608> hey btw, also nice to see some new updates to the bot
Hi, is there a way to setup a queue where players can vote to choose the team size and if it reached the required votes it would start the queue?
Don‚Äôt think so
Im not sure if u can disable an specific command, but you can disable the use of slash commands via server integrations
maybe you are thinking about /queuesizeoverride? if so, unfortunately that command has been deprecated
what is ''/mmr change variance''?? i dont understand it
its like the ranges of mmr changes
per win for example
it's still doesn`t work
<@145305657237700608> helpme pls
the bot has all permissions allowed
no command works
and the queue is blocked we cannot perform any action
there must be something overriding the bot¬¥s perm
The bot has this role above, could this be what is causing the error?
this role does not have any permissions that the bot needs
it's works!
tks!
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608>
Looks like someone ended the queue?
don't know
how can i start it
either /startqueue, or use /load with the config code
do /config list
and see if theres any recent one
damn, so theres no alternative to that?
yea there is no way to start a queue with more people than will be on the teams
Queue's auto-lock function in "/lock" is no longer available. Is that the kind of update?
That command is deprecated
I see thx
use `/schedule` instead
oh! that's goodü•∞  thx!
can i setup that teams get created based on mmr but maps will be banned by random captains?
if so how?
not currently, if teams are created using any mode other than captains, there is no concept of captains
;_; it would be so goooood would make the bot perfect imo üòÑ
does party system work with captains?
yes parties should work with all queue types
can i remove this ?
`/reshuffle Disabled`
Anyone have issue with the leaderboard loading forever on any pages other than the first or last?
Can be discord issues, you can generate a web leadearboard by `/leaderboardconfig shorturl` if you want to
or just click the title of the leaderboard
all leaderboards are visible online
oh didnt know that
yep like https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/505102060119916545/963912718652412014
add option to disable /ping
you can hide the command via Server Integrations
but I want it to work in discord not in browser
just asking if it's known or common issue
if you click on the image and copy url, can you paste it here
How to limit the use of the /cancel command?
limit by tank
rank'
my server members are abusing the /cancel command
I want to disable this command or limit it for certain ranks
it's possible?
Nope it‚Äôs not possible to limit it
U can deactivate the use of commands in your server
okay! tks
Is there a way to make that ... if people queue in a party the will get less points for a win and lose more if they lose
I would say no, I don‚Äôt think so
what are the restrictions for the command /channelrestrictions
Basically that only people in queue can see them and interact on them
can you elaborate more
By default, only people in each team can join the respective voice channel
Check my feature request
plz is good idea
You can change how many games are required to show on the leaderboard
when neatqueue makes a queue channel I am getting a permissions error, even though the bot has the required perms. is this a common issue?
Check out if theres something overriding the bot¬¥s perms
like, category settings, roles that you may gave to the bot
it only has the original role it gave itself with perms, and the channel i am trying to use it in I specifically put its role in there and made sure it was checked
does role heiarchy make any difference?
idk i gave it a bunch of other perms and it seems to be fine now?
not sure what the issue was
If u put for example, a normal role over the role the bot itself created it will override the perms
ah, yeah i see the problem now
If u put a role above of the neatqueue one make sure it has the same perms
got it
now, a more complicated question, we are wanting to use the bot in our server for valorant and use it to split up players by skill. our goal was to have 1 queue for each "rank", of which we have 4. from what im gathering, each queue is independant correct? theres no way to have players register, get a role, and have access to their ranked queue?
You can do /requireregister for valorant (This only will work if they have mmr, or played rank games), and then you can set /autoroles for each mmr range you want to, and then for a queue to limit access to one role you can do /rolerequirement add
is there a way to link queues so they all share stats though?
my concern is the stats arent transfering between queues, so once they "rank out", they wont be transferred to their new rank
Yeah if u name all the queues by the same name, stats will share
oh xD must have missed that in the documentation
/queuename üëåüèª
ok, and then within each queue channel i just set the role requirement, and then set a link channel for registration yeah?
ty btw, youre a life saver
Hi. I‚Äôm trying to setup the bot for predecessor, creating a role queue for two teams of 5 however when the queue was full, it didn‚Äôt pop at all?
and last question, i couldnt find a pause function, is there a command for that
I did the interactive setup for it
Not sure what I‚Äôm doing wrong
it didnt make a "#queue-x"?
or a queue vc?
Do temp channels need to be enabled during the setup process it walks you through ?
did you do advanced setup
no, not necessarily, it should just make a new text channel with the necessary things
Maybe the bot just didn‚Äôt have the proper permissions to do so
i would double check your bots permissions first
I think that‚Äôs what it was
yeah it needs to be able to create channels
it working now>
Okay
Hold on
word
If u disable temps channels, then the queue will execute on the queue channel with no channel creations
isnt that just temp vcs tho?
It includes text and vcs
If you want, you can also use /mmr requirement and won‚Äôt need to set autoroles
i think auto roles is cool so everyone can see who theyre competing with
but that is good to know
It‚Äôs good now
If I don‚Äôt add heroes though
Will it skip through the draft
And just assemble the teams?
Also it gave people the option to vote to have MMR enabled or disabled
How do you just make it so it‚Äôs always enabled
/mmr change allow_disable allow_disable:False
You can check a basic guide here: https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
I did
can you pause queue so people can only use them during designated times? i dont see that anywhere
If you are trying to achieve something more advance lmk
Some of it is a little confusing
No u can‚Äôt pause a game
no a queue
not a game
I also used the command so it picks balanced captains
like if i only want people to be able to play friday and tuesday, for example
If I added in heroes though previously, I am assuming it deleted those inputs when I set the queue up over again??
any time you end the queue you lose everything
from my understanding
Oh, there‚Äôs a new update for that, check /schedule on documentation, i think u can achieve it like that, *If u want it automatic*. if u want to do it manually just do /lock, and /unlock on friday and tuesday
ah lock, thats what i was looking for üôÇ
thank you sir
No you don‚Äôt lose it, it just ends, but the data is saved on the code the bot drops üòä
That‚Äôs good
If I have 10 people join the queue
It‚Äôll create a match
Then if another 10 people join it
It‚Äôll create a second one
And so on
Cool
But last question
If I set the draft type to snake
With no heroes yet inputted, will it just skip that
And I can draft manually in a text chat for the time being?
Then once I add heroes it‚Äôll use that input for drafting and banning?
Again sorry for perhaps basic questions. I‚Äôm just making sure I understand it correctly lol
Draft types are only available for captains i think so
I want the same draft type for every match it creates
I used the command to set it
I guess that‚Äôs it
It‚Äôs always gonna be the same, just do /captains drafttype if u wanna change it
Okay cool ty
When I change the number of lobbies to f.e 2 the queue will go to 0/20 does that mean that 20 people need to queue before a match will start or will it also start a match if 10 people queue bcs it would be one lobby
it waits for 20
hi, the bot is saying we need to get premium to go over 50 games per day.
thing is, we haven't done 50 games today. what do?
What server? Someone else said this earlier
OS Competitivo
should I send an invite? or the ID?
ID: 1037989091502993469
nope its fine i got it
im seeing you have 20 games?
about 24h ago we had game #105
and the last one was #128
20 games today sorry
should be about that, yeah
whats it showing?
showing where?
its saying you need premium?
and that was just a bit ago?
about 10 min ago
hm thats strange
ill check
mkay, thx for the help
try now? i did another reset, maybe it didnt work earlier
mkay, gimme a sec
worked, ty!
any idea why this happened? anything we should try to refrain from doing?
no it wouldnt be you
maybe i accidentally pushed an update when the reset was supposed to happen
seems it didnt happen today
I see
ty again
after there is enough ppl in hte queue to start a match
its takes too long before creating the channels and actually start the match
is there a command for this>?
You wanna skip everything?
maybe you are using the matchmaking queue type? switch to /queuetype PUGs
NAH JUST TO AVOID WASTIN TIME
But what are u refering to?
when the queue fills up, it creates a voice channel, and when everyone joins it will start
bah it was taking to much time to do that i guess
after cheking neatz was right... it was on matchmaking
i wanted to ask, once que has started and puts the players in the voice channels how do i set the voice channel name and not to be the players name
is it 1v1, or its captains name?
it was 1v1
i was just testing
but i want to set it up for 4v4
i dont want captian names
i want one of the teams name "SPECGRU" and the other named "KORTAC"
/teamnames
thankyou
also, once in the que it is not asking best of 1 or 3
AND IS THERE A WAY ONCE THE QUE IS FULL AND CREATES A VOICE CHANNEL IT AUTO DRAGS IN EVERYON THATS IN THE QUE
sorry for caps
Yeah u set a Lobby
Is there a / command
/lobbychannel set
It creates one but doesn‚Äôt drag everyone to it
Okay
U need to create a vc
For example the waiting room
And set it as the lobby
The ones who are in lobby and the queue will be dragged to the queue temp channel
Did u set the vote to true?
no how do i do that plz
On the parameter
sorry im not following
On the parameter of the command /bestof
U can see them above
Also select vote selection to majority
is there a way where once the teams are chosen the players pick best of 1 or 3
in the que chat that opens with the que
how do i do this
Yeah with the command i said
it does not give the players an option
it just sets to what i set it to
Can u show me how did u run the command?
./bestof 3
and it set to best of 3
I told you u need to set the vote to true
This is how it should look
Oh okay
Theres a bug where your MVP awards for each month are always your all time mvps and not just that month
Is there a fix for that?
currently points and mvps are not queue specific stats, so they don‚Äôt get tracked monthly
so not really a bug, just how it works at least right now
Is there a way to delete mmr changes from a match?
and/or cancel a queue if a player leaves after the lobby is setup but before the actual game starts?
/cancel
Would work in lobby timer aswell
But it auto cancel automatically if a player doesn‚Äôt join the vc
If you have it in required
so last night we had a game start, create teams, and then a player left before they actually played the match, and the team with a full team voted for their team to win
they did join vc, it was after they got moved to team calls
You do /cancel and it will start a votation, or you can set a /staffchannel too, so you can cancel played games or change winner after the game was finished whenever u want
dope, thank you üôÇ
im sorry, i know i saw this discussed a couple days ago, how do you force team selection to be balanced? we dont want players to choose between captains, random, balanced, etc
nvm, found it sorry lol
Is there any way to make a queue with only one team?
/numberofteams 1
OH CRAP üíÄ that's mb
Tysm
I'm being a tit somehow. I've had this for months and had it as admin as its easier than changing perms etc and never had an issue

I moved it to a bot role, I've enabled perms but I'm still getting this message
The only solution is checking what is overriding the bot‚Äôs perms
perfect mate sorted it
noiw im getting kicked out the q every min when i que up, how can i change it ?
cant leave the queue or join one, i ended the previous qeue before this
wdym getting kicked out
like it was stopping the q but i just did the setup again and it seems fine
<@145305657237700608> i use this bot just for 1v1 matchups, is there a way to remove the team selection stuff and just have the enable/disable mmr button?
is this normal for the matchmaking to adjust rating by a different # than whats specified before
/teamselection
But the enable and disable button for mmr won‚Äôt be available
would mmr be enabled or disabled by default
also i used team selection and idk which one to choose
to get rid of team selection
oh nvm i think i got it
Enabled
exactly what i want :)
yes, the estimated MMR change does not include any multipliers
<@498310733109526538> ‚ô•Ô∏è
also i guess i put the bot in french oops
idk why it put the thank you message twice
if it charged me twice its ok lol
üëÄ  no looks like it was once
maybe cuz both the nodes saw the donation...
where can i buy premium?
you can login to the dashboard at https://www.neatqueue.com
Had this ticket submitted in our server, I assume it just changes their vote, not count for multiple votes yeah?
yep it just changes your vote
ty üôÇ
i did want to say, im very impressed with this app. you really have thought of everything hahahha
are there any plans to add stat tracking n such to the dashboard?
what sort of stats? no i have no plans
how to make team 1 captain picks first ?
there is /captains firstpick
but you can‚Äôt specify which team currently
<@145305657237700608> i got this error code LOSBA
<@145305657237700608>  excuse me but we tryin to play a 12vs12 match and its giving an error
<@145305657237700608>
use /teamselection again
you must have loaded a super old config code
which isn‚Äôt compatible, i only started updating configs like 6 months ago
seeing you hit errors still
Yeah ended that queue and reloaded it in a new queue and channel, didn‚Äôt try it after
if you used the new code it sends when you end, that would work fine
i assume you had an old code written down you loaded up
I used save config then loaded it into a new channel
Ended the old one also
Its not old maybe 2 weeks
hmm that sounds strange then
ok seems its a new code, but somehow you have 0 team selections methods selected
which im not sure how thats possible
i guess just the leaderboard but more back end oriented, like matches played, player count, win %, but in like a csv format
you can get more detailed info via the API
but currently no plans to expand stats on the website
ok so i have a question thats kinda broad, i used to be a part of a server that used neatqueue for an independent ranking system, i know nothing about code or anything of the sort but i do know a lot about the game i play and i do know how i want the system to be set up the server that used to use neatque is no longer up due to loss of traffic through the server and i wanna recreate something similar to the server. the question is how would i use neatqueue for that
Try out `/setup`, check out the starter guide (https://www.neatqueue.com/guide), check the full documentation (https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/), and ask questions here üôÇ
thank you so much
Is there a way to make it so a mod can give the correct player an mvp award or is it just manual only with /add mmr /add mvps
It‚Äôs just manual
can we expect an addition to teams option for /captain firstpick command ?
for every Q
yea would be good, not today but soon
team 1 would always be the lower rated team, so setting the first pick to lower rated will make it team 1
Works perfectly, thanks!
MMR rating in name
not changing
Hey! I wanted to know if there is a way to link roles (ex:Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold,etc..) so they get priority for captains, because we want to use the MMR system and have the actual Valorant ranks too.
Winner of the queue sometimes is bugged, fake queues are shown instead
How to add a custom polling option? like please choose the server option?
check out `/votingmenu`
does it always happen?
ye it is still happening
there are spawning queues constantly
in place of "winner of the queue"
this never happened before?
When u mean constantly, you mean when a match is ended, or is it random
yes when a match is ended
ok yea i was able  to reproduce it
something wrong with my update earlier i assume
ok i think i found the issue
what is it?
issue with update from earlier on my end
should be working?
2 queues for now and it's ok
is neatqueue only designed for match up queues? or can it also be for a role playing game were ppl are on the same team, and there oisnt necesarrily a competition between 2  + teams
how can i make  the channel for Q  priete not for every one
sorry didn‚Äôt see this message, you can check out /balanceby to switch team balance so it uses discord roles instead of MMR, or /captains role for a priority in getting captain, that‚Äôs the two more related things i can think off
you can set the /numberofteams to 1, you just won‚Äôt get many stats since there isn‚Äôt any wins/losses
<@145305657237700608>
but it‚Äôll still do the whole private channel setup and stuff
the match channel, or where you made the queue?
ye team1 and team2
oh the voice channels?
it's public for everyone
did you disable /channel restrictions?
by default they arent public
so i have to make it  disable
enabled
can i give mmr with only adding someone a role?
and with role i refer to especfic valorant, like Radiant 2000 mmr for example <@145305657237700608>
I don‚Äôt think roles can give mmr
At least that I know
do you mean set the starting mmr?
or add mmr to everyone with a role
i think he means, if i add u "X" role, you will get an specific mmr
Can you still set up a no multi queue, so people can join a queue if there in another or in a current game?
ah yea nothing like that directly
you can change the /requeue condition
Thanks a lot man, been struggling a couple days with it hahaha <:PeepoLove:554421105805230120>
How does draft type hybrid 2 works?
exactly the order it shows
1 pick, then the next team gets 2 picks, then each team gets 1 pick over and over
starts out as a snake draft, but then is a straight draft
So its like the hybrid but without needing to check average MMR‚Äôs ?
We are trying to do a 1-2-1-1 for both teams so its 1 for both and then 2 for both
yes exactly
the second team will always get 2 picks
you would be looking for 1-1-2-2
which isn‚Äôt a thing currently
hello
how to cancel the queue channel '' the channel that must player join on it to complete the queue '
<@145305657237700608>
Do you mean disable it?
exactly
But what do you mean exactly? You want no channels ?
yes i need to remove this option
ineed to start queue without it
but i don't know the command
If u disable that channel then no channel will be created, like team vcs
but the queue doesn't start when all players doesn't come this channel
i need the queue to start without come this voice
u know what am talkin about
many servers doing this but ican't get the command
You can make it to not be required by /voicechannels mode, and set it to optional, or if you don‚Äôt want voicechannels set it to disabled
thx BIGBOSS <@648635725964902411> üëè
is there a way to make queue channels viewable by everyone?
voice channels?
or text
the channels that say like, queue#255
rn its only viewable by the 2 contestants and admins
and it would be nice if everyone can chat in them too
but also i dont want unverified members to view it lol
you can disable `/channel restrictions`, or set up a `/spectatorrole`
cool, thx
i tried both of those and viewing the server as the spectator role and they didnt work. it seems like the spectatorrole only applies to voice channels, but i want everyone to be able to view the "queue#" channels
Channel restrictions should work
hmm i‚Äôm pretty sure spectator roles can view the text channel by default
i think it works now, idk what happened before
sometimes the queue voice and text channels end up appearing in a different category in the discord anyone had this problem?
it also disconnects from the queue chat and doesnt auto drag people into team 1 and team 2
so everyone can view the channels now, but i don‚Äôt want them to be able to talk in them, is there a way to do that?
So if u want that, channel restrictions isn‚Äôt what u need, you need the spectatorrole
Hey <@145305657237700608> , have a few questions about the bot

1) I want to set 30 mmr per win\loss, but it should depend on average mmr of teams. E.G. if your team have 600 mmr average, and enemy 500 mmr average, then **ALL TEAM** gain +27 and lose -33 (So all players in team gain same mmr, but gain depends on team strength like faceit) Is it possible?

2) Is it possible to make that players cant be captains for 2 games in a row? I want to use "vote for captains" but players who were captains in previous game should not be included in vote

3) Is it possible to make /cancel that need 9\10 votes and winner message still should have 6\10 votes?
spectatorrole can still talk in the queue
and channel restrictions are enabled
In the parameters of the spectator role you can see other parameter called can speak
Just set it to false
o bet
people can still text in the queue channels <a:pensiveFast:1002055009141276682>
i gave verified people the spectator role and set can speak to false
<@648635725964902411> any other ideas?
here's an example if this helps
so you want people to not be able to talk?
ye i want everyone to see the queue channels but only the contestants and admins can talk
did you try adding everyone as a spectator role?
the spectator role is my "verified" role which is everyone except bots
that didnt work?
i also tried switching it to @ everyone and they can still talk
did you verify which role is letting them speak?
is it actually the spectatorrole? By default, spectators cant speak
yea the spectator role is verified, which is everyone
this is the problem, the send messages option isnt disabled
this is under the queue channel
<@145305657237700608>
cant u just disable it for the category?
we tried that
the send messages option not being disabled in queues overrides it
hmm ok i guess send messages should be disabled explicitly for spectators
so is that an issue with the bot or my end
no i will make that update
yea looks like the text channel currently doesnt inherit from the category either
cool, can i expect the update in the updates channel so i know when to test it?
yea ill post about it in there
should be a quick change
thanks üòá
Hey so I'm trying to set up a snake draft for agent picking with the bot and I'm not sure the best way to execute that, would anyone be able to give some advice if possible?
you cant customize the draft type for anything besides captain selection
ah okay, is it a possible implementation that can be made in the future?
Cause from what i see using hero bans as your draft method only allows straight draft
perhaps im not sure
you could manually make your own draft type using `/votingmenu`s instead
and just add 1 vote for each team, in the order u want
1) No this isnt a thing currently, everyone has indepedent MMR changes. You can almost get what you want if you do `/message winnermessage format`
2) Also not a thing, but maybe a feature request
3) Thats a good idea i think, being able to override specific vote requirements
Is there a way to only allow certain roles to join queue? I would like for my supporters only to be able to queue for certain days
/rolerequirement
thanks! will test now
hello when the queue is full and it makes the first team 1 and 2 it doesnt automatically drag people into the call team 1 and 2 and also the voice channels randomly start being made at the top of the discord can i pleas have some help?
U changed neatqueue‚Äôs perms? Or added any role
did nothing also just double checked logs to confirm that
Hmm, try to do /channel category to specify the category where the channels are going to be created
its prob the bot being bugged
restarted hopefully it fixed
He had the issue since yesterday
It can bug for one server ?
so watch out if it‚Äôs fixed
i will message u guys once i test it ty for reply
honestly no clue
all issues fixed ty
How to add certain maps in an existing queue that dont have to be chosen by players, but get randomly picked by the bot? Ty
And do i need to add the maps 1 by 1 or seperate them by using ","
Do queues that stop due to premium subscription expiry automatically start or do i need to re-setup queue ?
You can just add them via `/map add`, then change the `/map selection` to random
yes üò¶
you would need to reload the config
<@145305657237700608> is it possible to add all this stuff till december? We starting new season in december and its the features we really need
im doing the separate vote requirements now, ill work on the captain thing too
the last bullet im not sure i will wanna add though
have u tried changing the winner message format?
it shows the general MMR change, but everyone still has their own calculations
Yeah but players with low mmr still will get a lot, even if they are playing in strong team
We need mmr deviating totally depend on team strength
Cause rn High MMR player can pick low MMR player and boost his mmr
usually that would mean the player deserves the MMR if they can carry a player that hard i would think
but alright i guess it wouldnt be too hard to change
how to disable this option
<@145305657237700608>
`/voicechannels mode`
change it to ?
<@145305657237700608>
if i disable this the bot won't make team1 and team 2 vc ?
Sorry For Mention
if its disabled, yes it wont create the voice channels
you might want Optional
i can‚Äôt find the placement matches part anywhere on the docs
i‚Äôm trying to figure out how many placement matches, and how much the multiplier is
ill add it in the docs
but its 10 matches, starting at 1.4x boost, slowly declining back to no multiplier
awesome good to know
and then after the 10 matches, whatever the mmr they have will give then a role?
no you will still get roles before the placements, it just accelerates any changes
hmm gotcha okay
nevermind figured it out
just also have to set a autoroles games
do those two overlap? like
can i have it where someone has to reach 5000 mmr, and also have 100 matches played to acquire a certain role?
no :/
how do i put a mmr criteria on a queue...so you have to be over 1100mmr to join the queue
i tried setting the queue to mmrfloor 1100  but people below 1100 could still join queue
mmrfloor means the limit of the lowest mmr that people can reach, what you want is /mmr requirement
we have open queue and sweaty queue...open no restrictions sweaty 11oo mmr minimum and starting mmr is 1000
oh ok
tyty
is there a way to have a role that gains u access to the queue even if ur mmr is below the mmr requirement?
no that requirement can't be overriden
so if a server gets deleted before the end of the premium plan. what happens to it?
can i put it on a different server?
sure just lmk and ill transfer
so long story short, the owner of the server deleted it already cause he got banned from the game
and im trying to make the new scrim in my team server
send me a DM and we can try and figure something out
done
seems like everyone now can talk in queue-channels
not only partecipants
why?
spectator_role is None by default
hmm the bot should be setting @ everyone to have view_channel disabled
nothing, they can still speak
and they can also see them
what do the permissions for the channel  look like for everyone?
for some reason everyone can see the queue channel o.o (i mean ppl who are not in the queue)
^ same thing, what does yours look like?
@ everyone has view_channel disabled for me but they can still see queue channels
I removed them the possibility to talk in it
it was never like this before i changed nothing xd
ye me too
there was an update today
but if everyone has view_channel disabled, why can they see the channel?
they must have another role which is giving them access?
wat to do mr neatz ;_;
im assuming everyone has view_channel disabled, but your verified role has view_channel enabled?
yes it has
yea that complicates it then
ok ill revert that permission change
u broke everything xddd
it was ok before
can u tell us when its done?
done
well lets see if everything works in the next game
how to add ping button in queue message?
There‚Äôs no option for that
This happened a number of times now. Is this a bug in captain selection random?
that looks like a bug, ill investigate
cant reproduce, you have any more info? is this the first vote for captains?
Oh no, we went through 10 or more vote messages. Also i noticed that it happens when alot of players vote at the same time
after 20 tries it won't care anymore lol, maybe thats it
Moreover the reason we reach 20 times or more is there were 16 players but it keeps rotating between 6-8 players with different variations of captains
fair
i‚Äôll bump it up to like 100
^ done
Thank you <@145305657237700608> üôèüèΩ
<@145305657237700608> hey good sir how do you report who won and lost. im new to this bot
when a match is created, it will pop up a vote for the players to vote for the winner
how can i make channel for logs
winners and points
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>
/staffchannel set
nah not staff
i mean
winners
/resultschannel
Can you make mvp votes required seperate from default <@145305657237700608>
Kinda like how you can make winner votes seperate from default
ah yea, thats a good idea
How to disable test mode ?
`/test`
It says its enabled
do it again and it will turn off
If/when you do could you ping me and lmk
will do
when i try to make a   queue into teams  the command doesnt come up.. i want it to show 20 teams of 3
the command is now `/queuetype`
role requirement isnt working for me, im setting the queue for the "casual" role but i can still join it without the role
weird cuz it's worked in the past for me
do you have more roles added?
you only need 1 of the roles to be able to join
nope
i even made a fresh server to test it and i could still join without the required role
help guys
my leaderboard no longer appears <@145305657237700608>
what did you change
the bot had a bug and I reset everything, but now it doesn't show anything anymore
what do you mean you reset everything
did your queue name change?
I used the /setup command again
and that was it
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
I understood
How do I get it to appear again?
use `/queuename` and select the old name
okay
yeah, fresh bot and fresh queue, i dont have the casual role and i can queue
ah, i forgot i added the @ everyone role as a required role by default
but that breaks this since you would need to remove the role now...
you can see if you /info, both roles are there
ok sick i removed @ everyone and it works
thanks
yea i added that so that by default, to be on the leaderboard you need to be in the server :/
but probably should change, thats confusing
is that gonna cause issues if i remove @ everyone
nope
How do I have two different leaderboards? <@145305657237700608>
need some help if anyones about?
What do you mean?
done <#910981294937210930>
Hey when i try to register it says admin has to configure webhook. What does this mean & what do i have to to? (I'm the owner)
you must have selected the "Custom API" `/requireregister` type
its meant so when someone uses the register command, it will send a request to your own server
Why does the mvps leaderboard always stay at all time
Even when you filter a specific month it always shows all time mvps
mvps and points are not per-queue stats, so they don‚Äôt get tracked monthly currently
Hai, i was wondering can you make map selection only some set maps and then they just vote on those?
Instead of having banning and voting with them all
And it can random pick one from the ones youve inputed
you can change the map selection via /map selection
and bans with /map bans, if u dont want any just set to 0
Oh okay
Thank you
Can i override the map selected by bot as staff ? We use random map selection but sometimes we want to change
no you cannot, but also the map doesnt change anything with stats, so you could just send a message in the chat
is there a way to have a vote to pick server region?
you can add a custom `/votingmenu`
like `/votingmenu add title:Region options:NA,EU,SA key:Region team_voting:All Teams`
Thanks!
Also, is there a way to have a queue where its 4v4 but let the queue fill in with any amount of players and the captains pick out of the pool of players
no thats not possible
Is there a way to lock the queue when a game is currently going on. And the queue automatically unlocks once match results have been reported.
also no, but why would you want that?
Are these results or something else
How can I change the channel for these messages
/resultschannel
What‚Äôs the difference between these
this is the staffchannel for staff to monitor match results + modify if needed
How can i control message sending in the queue channel ? I dont want to manually adjust each and every player in the queue
There‚Äôs no option for that, you just can disable it via category settings or server integrations
I have temp channels on, does that apply to it also ?
is there a way to merge two people on the leadboard into one?
You can merge queues but I don‚Äôt think u can merge an specific player
guys, quick question 
how can i prevent ppl from joning the role when its 2/2?
as I understand when there are more ppl in one role it picks randomly which player will play in queue
or maybe it does work like the additional person stays in queue
this is how it functions
and currently no way to disable the overfill
understood, thanks
How does the tournaments work? Is it eliminations or brackets? Does it support multiple groups ?
it‚Äôs a single elimination tournament
pretty simple implementation of a tournament
We did a test earlier and people had to join VC‚Äôs to start. How can i disable that?
Voice channels mode to optional
Just a question: does a deleted queue count in the 50 available games?
Wdym deleted queue?
U mean canceled games?
Yes it counts
thank you
Is there a way to disable voting on teams coze some ppl vote on the wrong team so the only way to give points and close que is from the staff channel
by default its a majority vote so should be hard for people to select the wrong team
but you can set `/message winnermessage results` to Staff Only
also if you enable `/anticheat`, it will flag players who vote incorrectly
Oky thx
question, so i have no clue how to get the results i want. im pretty stupid with bots, althought i just want to set this up for some fun. im using the same model as someone else and i cant figure out how he did some of his features.

Firstly, he has a waiting room VC and when the queue gets full, it auto pull everyone into the VC for their queue so that the match start automatically once everyone is in and auto pulls them in their new team VC. Mine doesn't do any of that.

2nd when all players join the queue VC, instead of the match starting automatically and picking the teams based on MMR, it makes us do a vote for captains, random, etc. even tho during setup i just put normal individual queues.

also if i did the advanced setup, i noticed it doesnt put the match details in the temporary queue text channel, it puts it in the public channel for some reason, when i only do the basic setup it categorizes it correctly which is weird.
sometimes "winner of the queue" is bugged, fake queues are shown instead, is there a way to "respawn" a winner of the queue for a choosen queue?
e.g. I want "winner of the queue" for the X queue
first: `/lobbychannel`
second: this is the default setting, change via `/teamselection`
third: What match details?
wdym bugged?
they don't appear
this "fake queue" is shown in place of winner of the queue
That‚Äôs not a ‚Äúfake queue‚Äù it‚Äôs the same queue but the message sends again
It bc the queue always try to stick at the bottom
Exact but it's unaesthetic, the queue just ended is shown above the following one and it is stucked on 4/6, when you hit Join Queue on the fake you enter the bottom one.
The only way to remove it, is to delete the message from discord but the "winner of the queue" is not shown, that's why I asked if there was a way to generate a winner the queue by selecting a X queue.
U must have something disabled or enabled
What changes have u made
that doesnt seem right
is it every time?
nothing, it has always happened, I think it's a bot issue itself
not always but frequently, it's a random thing
some queues are closed correctly, others are not, I think it is simply an internal problem of the bot going into operation overload
its only a visual bug
yea exactly
the bot seems to generate the ended queue with some participants instead of "winner of the queue" for some reason
its just the old queue message
it's not a big deal, just unaesthetic and sometimes players can't take track of their result/rank because of this
but yea shouldnt be happening
I thought it was a common issue, I have been experiencing this from the beginning but sometimes it's annoying cause multiples old queue messages are replacing the outcome of the games consecutively
must be a visual bug or operation overload
could be interesting to add a feature where you can generate the outcome of a X queue
Have u tried to put the results on another channel?
I'll give it a try
that would fix it, but ill try and fix it on my end as well
although I'm afraid of messing up the bot, last time we had to start all over again
you can save snapshots of your current config with `/config`
Im getting always the same error
When im doing /setup
It says after i clicked some things "interaction failed"
I made a full new server so cant be anything with roles
same for me before, just make a new /setup until it will be fixed itself
Is there a way to do a dynamic scoreboard and winners? Like I'm trying to do something for Battle Royale and it's not as simple as "XYZ won" . Is there a way I can give certain points for certain placements ? And then after each match just fill it out "team 1 got 1st, team 2 got 13th etc"
not currently, it only allows 1 winner so doesnt function great for BRs
How can i make team 1 captain pick first
Not team 2
`/captains firstpick mode:Highest Rated`
Didn't work?
its changest for future games, not current ones
I did it before we join this q
I will give it another try
Ok it worked when i put lowest rated
All good
I deleted the OG queue for this leaderboard because I didnt need it anymore and I had 3 queues linked to this, but now it's saying no queue found
everyone's mmr is still universal across all the other ranked queues but i dont have a leaderboard of everyone anymore
when i do leaderboard in elite queue it's just 3 people
you probably have a role requirement for that queue?
yeah i do, but only role requirement leaderboards can show up
i want a channel with a leaderboard that shows everyone
right now that channel is telling me no queue found
you would need a queue without a role requirement then
which you link to
thanks that worked üëç
Hi, how can i fix the first page does not work in the leaderboards? Specifically for MMR (W-L-T)
Hi!
I have a question. The MMR that you set to a user with the command (/sett mrr) is global? I mean, does it apply to every queue in the server?
If not, how can I make the MMR Global to the server and shared between queues?
Thanks!
does it work fine online?
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
It says failed to load image
if you right click the image, copy the URL, then open in browser does it load?
Yea it does
must be your discord client having some issues
if the URL is valid, its discord's fault if it doesnt show
hey this is not really an important issue or a problem for us, but when we have a role requirement then the leaderboards have inaccurate green or red indicators, im assuming because it calculates a difference in rank across leaderboards of the same queue
hmm that makes sense
that is complicated cuz it does calculate the rank change from whatever queue was last played
which is calculated in terms of the role requirements
so when viewed with different requirements, it might not be fully accurate
just wanted to bring it to your attention just in case you didnt know about it
but its not a problem
or important
yea never thought of that, thanks! ill think about if its worth fixing lol
is there a way to join a Q without the bot sending us a dm? New to using this bot, we have a competitive Gears 5 server over 700 people, we are trying to add this Elo bot.
what DM? the bot doesn‚Äôt send any DMs when you join queue
yes , it sent me a dm to join the part/q
oh, yes party joining goes into DMs
you don‚Äôt need to click the button in the DMs, you can use the /party join command
thank you!
will come back if need further assistance. <@377649834427154444>  and i are together
tryin to work on this
We likin this bot fr
<@145305657237700608> Is there a way to change how to pick the winning team
right now its only voting
Wich way you want to reach?
like with this other bot the elo staff reports the game
is there something we can do like that?
where like only admins can report the scores, not the players, they will false report .
just the admins of the discord
Oh yeah, you can set a /staffchannel set, in that channel will be the logs of the matches, and u can select winners or revert/cancel games
awesome!! thank you
Frfr
So set that, and if u want full control that only staff can vote do /message winnermessage results
And set it to staff only
perfect
What does the /anticheat commands do
Commands have a short description
why can anyone enter the voice channels and not just queue participants?
You must disabled channel restrictions?
or maybe you added a spectator role
I see his message logs and it seems that he added spectator role to everyone on their server? Not sure
No, both are incorrect. I have spectator role : None, and Channel restrictions : Enabled
check the team channels and see what is giving access
Ok you got it, there is a server role who can see and access the voice channels, however this role is necessary to participate in the queues so it is assigned to all verified members
if its assigned to the category, then it will override the new channel's permissions
you can try using `/voicechannel permissions` to overwrite it
Ok, which kind of permissions should I deny for this role with the command?
just connect?
yea that would be the one granting access for everyone
thank you very much
<@145305657237700608> hu
can help me
whats up
I want to add a role to allow ROMs to appear
ROMs?
if I set ```/tempchannels permissions set role:@everyone permission:View Channel value:Deny```will players for the game still be given access to the channel? So that no one other than players can see the temp channel I mean
yeah
cool ty
yea rooms
voice
but not need add in role adminstretor
yes but this is the default behavior anyways
i believe
<@145305657237700608> I want to add a roll to the bot so that you can see it and be able to access the voice. How to add it?
you can just do it by server integrations
like a normal role
or give a spectator role
yea how can add it
/spectatorrole add
thx bro ‚ù§Ô∏è
Is there any way to make the opposing team not able to join your temp voice channel? Hopefully what I'm asking makes sense lol
They can‚Äôt join unless the voice channel is not full
So there‚Äôs no possible to avoid opposing the enemies team to join into vc if their vc is not full
My server has no limit on the vc since I allow spectators to join. So I guess the bot would have to specifically not allow the enemy players to join the channel
yea so the way it works when setting up the voice channels is:
1) Deny everyone from joining
2) Allow spectator to join, and speak if allowed
3) Allow staff to join and speak
4) Allow the team to connect and speak
5) Handle any `/voicechannel permissions` overwrites
so im assuming everyone has the spectator role, so its letting people on any team join any voice channel?
Yes exactly
hello
is there any possibility to delete this voting menu on the lobby?
you can disable via `/reshuffle`
nice, it works, thank u
1 more question
How can I ensure that the result report is by majority and not that everyone votes?
by default it is a majority
you can change via `/requiredvotes`
thank u so much man!
Is there any limitation on the bot? maximum number of queues?
Also, how can I delete a queue?
And, there is any way to desable partys?
<@145305657237700608>
the free tier gets 3 queue channels, 50 matches a day
and the premium tier?
how much it cost?
Hello
I need help me
<@145305657237700608> i need help me
Just drop your questions here
yes `/partyqueue`
what is the cost of the premium
login to https://www.neatqueue.com and you can view your server's dashboard for prices
it doesnt appear to me
ohh now it works
1 more question, what are the free plan stats?
like, maximum players?
i know that 3 queues, 50 matches
and btw, the payment is not working
500 players
does refreshing fix?
its a bug
if you move the bar, it crash
if you dont touch anything it works
and the price is different if you use the bar
it redirects to https://www.neatqueue.com/manage/undefined
Dont set custom inputs
Just move the slider
hmm i cant get it to break
i wonder if its something with your numbers having commas
my team #1 and team #2 channels doesnt auto lock to 5 people, how can i make it to autolock to 5 people once teams are set?
That‚Äôs by default, did u disable /channel restrictions?
maybe you have a spectator/staff role added as well?
that would prevent the channel limit
ye i remember it being there at the beggining but i didnt change anything setting related
is there a command i can use to reverse it or is it discord channel perms clash?
You can try enabling it again via /channel restrictions
ill let u know if it worked
i also try changing the admin perms on that channel
still havent auto did it
<@145305657237700608> there is any way to only assign mmr when i give a role to a player?
like, if I asing you A role you got 200 mmr, if I assign you 500 mmr you got B role
Hi guys, iam looking for a solution:
-theres one queue running on two channels
- one is for example for diamond role and another for gold role

The question is may I prevent gold from joining to diamond queue and vice versa?
(hiding the channels ot possible)
Nope
so, ive to set up mannualy the mmr to each player?
Well i don‚Äôt know what are you trying to reach
So i guess
i try to join the Q but it give me a eror
any fixes?
You can do custom perms via server integrations
can anyone help me ?
could you help me with that somehow?
Or just put the role requirement for each queue via /role requirement
so will the requirement apply for the que in certain channel (where the command is used) or will apply for everychannel where the queue is running?
For the certain channel
uhm that doesnt seem to work as i set the diamond role as required and the gold still can join.. or am i doint something wrong
can i have some help actually?
ive just setup the bot everthing
in other discord its working fine but not in this one
i do not, maybe its an onboarding thing?
if you are talking about the starting MMR, then yes you can use `/startingmmr`
currently every queue has `@everyone` as a role requirement, which you would need to remove in order to restrict the queues
you can check via `/info`
if you have 1 of the required roles, you can join the queue
yeah just did it
exactly when you wrote it üòÑ
plz rename the queue so it doesn't start with a $, it causes an issue apparently
`/queuename 8s`
ok it was, fixed now
if I set starting mmr for 3 roles, if I give a tole to someone it will receive that mmr amount?
role 1 - 100 mmr
role 2 - 200 mmr
role 3 - 300 mmr
if i give you manually role 2, you will auto have 200 mmr?
once you join queue for the first time
there is any way to set everyone mmr to some number?
like a hard reset
<@145305657237700608> I set up different mmrs for different roles, but all people has the same default mmr instead of his role
/starting mmr set
you can choose the everyone role
you can hard reset via `/managestats resetstats`
this also is a hard reset to delete players?
is not working, how can i delete all players from the bot?
not a specific queue
wdym not working, thats the command
that command reset the stats of a specific queue
the queuename argument is optional
hello. How can I put the score table?
Wdym score table?
the leaderboard
Just /leadearboard
If u want to show it in another channel do /link first, and link the q channel with the new one and then /leadearboard
how can I disable the /cancel command in a queue?
You can do /tempchannels permission, and select the role @ everyone, the command of slash commands and set the value to deny
you can also just disable the command in the server integration settings
still need help with my Q i try to join the q but keeps saying This interaction failed
any help
i responded yesterday
ow okey
how do i rename the q
`/queuename`
hello how can i made the bot decide our maps in a best of 3 ive done already /map selection random and then game mode selection random but still ask me to choose our game mode
is there any way to disable parties?
`/partyqueue toggle`
how the streak multiplier works?
i need help me
please
<@145305657237700608>My server has 650 people, and every time someone presses join, the bot writes this to him
you must have exceeded the free threshold
The more wins in a row you get, you will get an extra multiplier for mmr
whats the number of the multiplier exactly?
not sure
probably 1.2
Nah, we have gave the Queue role to just 206 Players and the max is 500 for the free version. Is there anyway we can fix this?
Or can we reset them to 0 and regive roles? ( it may fix the issue? )
I want the largest number of bots. I am in the bot month and there are many people playing on the server because this server is play cpl and I want the largest number of bots.
It means that 500 people joined the queue
so no matter if u have the role or not, if they joined before it will keep it unless you reset the queue, or manually reset, or buy premium for more slots
idk what you are asking
you need to go premium
is there any way to forbidden a player to queue again if has a match running?
That‚Äôs by default
not working with different queues
by default you can't requeue until you place your vote for the winner
change via `/requeue condition`
but you can queue un different queues?
different channels and different names
it doesn‚Äôt matter, the bot won‚Äôt let someone join a queue if the match hasn‚Äôt ended
if you have a game running in one of them you still beign able to queue in the other
You must have changed the requeue condition?
by default you will see either of these messages
that works if i try to queue in another queue?
for example, i have 2 queues, one called Queue A and other called Queue B, i have a match running on queue A, but i can queue in Queue B
is there ant way to manage it?
by default that is not possible
if you are in a match, you cant requeue
see the player called ‚Äúdavitrox‚Äù
he is in game
he left the queue 3 sec before i take the screenshot
but he was in queue
at the same time
requeue condition is default
no its not
you have it set to None currently
mmm im sure i didnt modify that but its ok
so ive to change that to none
in all queues?
Must vote*
perhaps you started with some config that had it disabled?
probably
i literally touch everythinh about the bot to understand it
i will fix it
and, what happen if a player is in 2 queues at the same time and 1 of them pop up, it will be kicked from the other?
yes exactly
nice ty
hi! i installed this bot to a server i admin for to actually help us have a visualization of which mods we have modding in our streamer's tiktok stream at any given time. so not the typical use-case but still so very helpful nonetheless! setup was a breeze and we're trying it out today. a few of our mods are joined in queue but someone just tried to leave it as they need to step away, but they are still showing in the queue. I just tried joining with the button and my name did not get added to the queue. So it seems that something is preventing it from updating with the buttons. any ideas where i should start troubleshooting? or is it like you can only join and leave one time once it's created? <:ty:1071122424931827773> and let me know if i can clarify anything
can you show a ss of your queue?
yup! so Tatobug tried to leave and she's still showing in there
and when she clicks the Leave Queue button it says she isn't in the queue
seems like is not editing the message
could you try to send a msg on that channel and the queue message will resend
maybe that can fix it
if it didnt resend lmk
you mean just type a regular message in the channel yeah? i just tried that and nothing happened, same behavior when i click join and leave
the queue message didnt resend?
ohhh interesting i just tried clearing the queue and got this - which i was running into at setup at first but was able to fix the perms. but idk what changed except for the fact that i started this channel as a private channel then added the mod role to it once i confirmed it was working
ok i see that the channel is private
so check if the bot has the correct perms for that channel
if u gave the bot a role, make sure the role you gave the bot has the same perms the bot needs, and also that he can see the private channels
AHH yup so that mod said that for some reason they could no longer see the channel, so i synced the channel to the category perms and i hadn't added the bot to the right category perms
classic skill issue
thanks for talking through that with me!
no problem, if u have more questions feel free to ask :)
is the site off?
i cant see the leaderboard
<a:think360:734801663600361532> link?
now its working
how can I see banned players?
or if a specific player is banned
./player banlist
how do reset everyones mmr to 1200 and reset all stats on the leaderboard.. like a new season
<@145305657237700608> any idea why mmr is reseting by itself?
I played all that games and my mmr reset to the starting mmr (700)
/managestats resetstats all, and then /startingmmr set to 1200
i had the same bug
the people who played one specific match reseted all mmr from they
any idea <@145305657237700608> ?

How to change temporary queue channel permissions ? 
I want to give the players in queue the ability to write application commands
/tempchannels permissions set
whoops
Thanks üôèüèΩ
is it just MMR was reset, or all stats?
it happened twice to me, first my personal mmr on that queue
and then with 5 users of 10 in another queue
5 min and rollback
really strange
like, 5 users got starting mmr and then rollback to their original mmr
i checked it with /stats and their stats didnt reset, only the mmr
so it‚Äôs only mmr that is resetting, not all stats
yes, only mmr
Hello, I'm using the bot primarily for a 1v1 queue setting. Is there any way to make the bot give both players the same role and move them into the same vc? Since the players are technically on opposite teams, I've found that it just automatically makes separate vc's for either of them. In addition, is there any way to create a temporary text chat for the two of them, so that the lobby ID can be shared? Thanks.
yes, only mmr sir <@145305657237700608>
It worked but when someone used /cancel, the captains couldn‚Äôt vote yes or no to the cancel voting
what did you change?
its possible to set up temp team voice channels maximum for X users?
like 3 users max restriction
The teamsize needs to be 3 then
yes but the voice channel doesnt have any restriction
You must have changed it
i mean this
/channel restrictions
so I put it on enabled and it will set up the user limit?
If you enable it the channels are gonna be displayed for only the ones on the queue
And the team vcs are gonna be the max of the teamsize
i mean this
because, i configured it to, everyone can see the voices but only the players of the queue can join
You added spectator role or something?
The only way to achieve what you want is putting the restrictions enabled
that can see the voices but cant join
that wouldn‚Äôt be a spectator role
spectator roles can join the voicechannels
but if you add a spectatorrole, the channel won‚Äôt have a limit
so, what ive to do for voice channel limit?
and remove the spectator role
ok i will test it
Bot not deleting channels after game is complete today
what about mmr bug? <@145305657237700608>
<#910981294937210930>
hopefully its fixed
i cant 100% confirm
i will let u know if it happens again
what is the function of the mmr decay?
like how it works, or what it does?
both
decay is a relatively common feature in games where players lose rating over time if they don't actively play
so you can say, lose 25 MMR for every week you don't play a game
that way nobody can camp the leaderboard
ohhh nice
got it
what about the feature i post on <#911057745204105237> ? about sending dm to players when the queue starts?
yea that can be an optional feature
nice, I think is really useful because a lot of people mute the servers
btw, how can i claim the premium role?
i been meaning to fix that, currently it only gets auto assigned if your server is on node 2
so i manually gave it
ohhh ok, ty
Hey, why captains cant vote when someone use /cancel
what did you change?
Its the default
Whenever they try to vote it says ‚Äúthis is not meant for you‚Äù
yea that would be a bug
i think i see it being possible since captains are removed from the "normal" player pool
Yea happened with us every time someone used /cancel. Everything else works
ok ill have a fix up today
hello, is there a way to see how many people participated in the queues so far? (x out of 500)
``/serverstats channelnames players`` will show how many players have joined the queue since it was created, setup a channel to show the players, and the name of the channel will change
or just `/serverstats info`
oh yuh
ok thanks, stats says "total players" : 506, was the limit 500?
its 500 players with current stats, you must have 6 people who don‚Äôt have any stats for any queue
so they aren‚Äôt counted
i should probably just update it to show the same number
is there any way to disable the 90m timeout due to "inactivity"?
put it in "disable"
thank you! i looked in the documentation and saw this command but couldn't quite tell if you could turn it fully off. appreciate it1
my bad, put it in "false"
yess i figured that out!
<@145305657237700608> Only player reported me that the bot asked him if he was active after the 3600 ms of inactivity, he told the bot he still active and the bot quit him of the queue
I think is not working that option
3600 seconds?
i‚Äôll verify it‚Äôs working but i believe it should be fine still
yes, like, the bot send a dm to hom asking if he is active
he select yes, and the bot kick him from the queue
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/409838780199993344/1168277952245538846/image.png?ex=65512ea1&is=653eb9a1&hm=307171429a94afa63d3eb0d30aec6468e9496d1eaaa882fc5115cae595e33068&=
ohh, now he told me that the bot send him 3 messages, like 5 min interval
there is any way to extend that time?
like, if he click im here, give him 30 min more of queue
hmm it should fully reset the timer
i‚Äôll check it out
ok, is not resetting
is sending the message after 5 min
Players are randomly having their elo reset in my server and im not sure whats causing it
did it happen today?
i know it happened a few times yesterday
Its happened a few times in the last 3 or 4 days
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> this happens often when someone has a long name
wait and see if it happens today plz
should be fixed
what‚Äôs the issue?
oh looks like discord doesn‚Äôt render the buttons correct on mobile?
i can‚Äôt fix that, but i guess could maybe cut off names that are too long? not sure
its still happening apparently <@145305657237700608>
could you give me the server ID + a user ID of who it happened to?
Hello!
I need help with a situation

I have roles that are assigned a specific MMR (for example: 2000 MMR, 2100 MMR, 2200 MMR, etc.), so the player who enters a queue for the first time starts from that MMR and not the 1000 that come by default.
Likewise, I created the rules so that the bot is in charge of delivering a specific role depending on the MMR that the player is obtaining (for example, the floor of the role "2000" is 2000 MMR and the ceiling is 2099 MMR), so the player who goes above 2099 MMR will get the role "2100". The bot is successfully delivering the roles depending on the MMR obtained, but the problem is that it is not taking away the initial role delivered to assign the initial MMR to the player. Is there any way to fix that?

Thank you so much!
are they still within the MMR range for the old role?
**Server ID** 1090775052779278377
**User ID** 288779012782817281
how much simultaneous queues allow the bot?
like, matches
unlimited?
Yeah unless you pass the game limit
nice ty
No, they dont
sorry my english is not very well does this mean I need to boost the sever to use learderboard?
which command is that?
yea creating a custom URL for the leaderboard requires purchasing premium
you can use the free URL if you click the title in the leaderboard
where can I find this?
ok thank you for helping

Hi guys, does /playerban resets one's mmr? How to chang it?
no, /playerban doesn't reset one's mmr, to change one's mmr use /setmmr
Well so any possibillity that ones mmr reset automatically?

I believe it happened between 23:42 - 0:07 my time (its 2pm) now here
whats this when trying to join a queue
You can pick whether you want to join it solo or with your party
is there a way for that not to come up?
you can either leave the party, or disable parties in the queue with `/partyqueue`
Hello, we have the Problem that one Q cant vote and because they cant vote the Players cant join new Q. Is there i way i can just end this 1 Match or reset it ?

How do I set the Queue bot to do the map picks and just have voted captains (VALORANT)
maps with /map add, then /map selection to random, captains, /teamselection, change it to captains, /captain selection to vote for captains
<@145305657237700608> the bot is setted up to make the teams balanced based on mmr
why did the bot create that teams?
again, 3 300 mmr vs 100
how do you turn off the ban that the bot puts inplace when u miss a queue?
/player autoban set it to 0
any idea <@145305657237700608> ?
what‚Äôs ur config
./config save
IUJSU
What will happen when 500 members are reached? Will the bot stop working or will it simply block access to new players?
No more new players
good thanks
Is there somewhere I can raise a ticket?
just drop your questions here and we can help, we like to make it like this so everyone can see different solutions :), but if it‚Äôs a bigger problem you can reach neatz
Yeh I‚Äôve dm neatz cheers
Hey, I was wondering if there's a way to make players not vote on a winner team and only admins can do it. I already made a submit channel so admins can do it but so can the players atm in que
``/message winnermessage results value:Staff Only``, and set a staff channel with ``/staffchannel set``
Thnx gang
the mmr auto reset the 1 november?
if you enabled it yes
I tried with another queue and the same <@145305657237700608>, idk if there is any setting incorrect, but some games are balanced and others no, like the examples I sent to you
are people in parties?
i‚Äôll test the config in a minute
but if people are in parties then you can‚Äôt get more fair
you have it set to random teams, thats why
where i changed it
ohh got it
<@145305657237700608> there is any way to change the timezone of the bot?
because it reset the season and in argentina we swill in october
not currently
ive been thinking that would be a good change though
set the server's timezone
yes because, i saw that you can set a timezone on scheduled commands
yea that wouldnt really be needed if you could set a server timezone
ill probs do it tomorrow, shouldnt be hard
nice, sound good
How do i see the bracket for the neatqueue tournament.
Also since u play overwatch can i have some assistance?
Have  a few questions on ow
click the queue title and it should bring you to the website page
and sure
hello is it possible that when the bot finds queue it sends private message to the people in the queue so it reminds them to join the voice room?
Hey! I use NeatQue in my server and I would like to give a certain role admin permissions on the bot, however, I cant figure out how to make a role that actually gains admin commands for NeatQue ONLY.
how do i find a list of all different queue names i have in my server please?
/staffrole
Super confused. The bot is saying it needs manage channel perms. Has them via bot role, it‚Äôs own role and in the channel itself overriding as it‚Äôs own personal perms. Why is it not allowing a setup protocol?
if you do something like `/queuename`, it will pop up all the results
could there be something else denying it?
Tbh I‚Äôm about to just give it admin perms
thats the easy fix
guys, how doea the priority for requeue works? I belived it works like:

1. Queue starts
2. another queue is starting imadiately
3. Priority roles have given time (f.e. 15 sec) to join as first
4. after 15 sec non priority roles can join
Am i right?
well i guess not as it didn't work üòÑ
Can u the tournament be double  elimination?

Also i play t3 would u mind giving me some insight on ow,

T3 is like the mobile version of it, its 5v5

Vc later? Or i send vod?
did you add a requeue delay?
otherwise priority doesnt really matter cuz the queue will just insta start
i didnt, read about it and added it
no the tournament system is pretty basic, only single elim
i see, do delay means delaying joining for a "casual" player
it prevents people who just finished the game from requeuing instantly
people with priority don't have to wait
okay, so it doesnt matter when the queue is starting.

So when the new queue is created the delay applies to ppl who finished the game earlier. If the user has a priority role, they dont need to wait and in this case the player who join his first queue (he hasnt played the one before) is treated as priority? am I right?
in that setup, then yes
Hey, neat two questions. What is the command for priority roles? And the 2nd is, how do I get more map options to appear in the que, I added the maps already but they're not showing, just two maps and random
/requeue priorityrole add
You can check your maps added by /info
Okay appreciate it
Another question, the que doesn't start instantly when there's 8 players. [I put the matchmaking que to 8] and it takes like three minutes to start the other que channels
What‚Äôs the queue type?
Matchmaking
If it‚Äôs matchmaking then it will just only start when there are 8 players with a close mmr with each other
If you don‚Äôt want that change the queue type to PUGs
Is pugs like matchmaking
Matchmaking is basically mmr search
PUGs it‚Äôs the same thing but without searching mmr, it will start when there‚Äôs 8 players
Okay got you üëçüèæ
help
<@648635725964902411>I don't know what to do here or how to configure the bot to do everything automatically?
<@145305657237700608> help?
<@145305657237700608>Good night, can you help me set up the bot?
So I'd like the queue to clean up after itself and delete old messages. Basically only ever showing the queue and the current game in progress. Couldn't find any options or through searching here, so does anyone have ideas?
Disable parties for that queue if that‚Äôs what you want, /partyqueue toggle
That‚Äôs by default unless you disabled temp channels
<@648635725964902411>Could you help me eliminate the other 2? it's that I misbelieve them
/managestats resetstats all and put the name of the queue that you want to delete
And end them with /endqueue
you don‚Äôt even need to reset stats
just end the other queues
<@145305657237700608> what happen if I set up 2 roles for starting mmr, different mmrs, and I queue with the 2 roles on my user
Your mmr will be the first role you added for you i think
there is any way to have 2 roles in the same mmr in the autorole? and the bot only set up you 1?
beucause I put them on exclusive but the bot stills giving the 2 roles
the utility of the muted role is to not beign pinged by the bot
like, if I have the tier 2 MUTED role only, and i play a queue, after the score report the bot assign me the other role
i dont want that
hmm yea that would be undetermined how it works
if they have the same exact threshold, it would kinda randomly assign them
i can update it so it won‚Äôt do that though if you already have a role
yes, that would work
not working for promotes and demotes, but thats not a problem, I can manage it manually
wdym not working
like
if you pass from tier 2 to 1, the bot would give you 2 roles
the muted and the normal
because it doesnt have any criteria to manage it
ah gotcha
that‚Äôs weird if they are exclusive
it should only give one
i‚Äôll check it out
nice, ty
lmk if you can fix it please
yea that should be fixed if it‚Äôs not working like that
<@145305657237700608> is it working now but only if normal role is active
not working for muted
like, if i only have tier 2 role, doesnt give me the muted one, but if I have only the tier 2 muted, the bot gives me the normal role
yea it‚Äôs just the order it decides to check in
since i never thought of this
so it‚Äôs kinda random
Do you know if you can make it leave only 1?
yea i‚Äôll fix it
nice ty
i was testing it and it assign the role that is above the other
yup makes sense, i have a fix
nice, when you push to production the fix i can test it
with that fixed i can configure 2 roles
yea ill update tomorrow morning when im able to watch things better
nice, ty
btw, probably when you fix that, we should test what happened if you promote or demote to another tier, like, the bot will give both roles? or how is it going to decide what role will give
because doesnt have any criteria
wdym both roles
like your muted vs non muted roles?
it will just give the first one that is valid for the player
see here, what happend if you up from tier 2 to 1
you would get the tier 1 role
if im tier 2 muted, and promote
i will get the tier 1 muted?
just tier 1
ohh ok
it doesn't have any relation with the muted roles cuz thats special for you
so it just thinks they are all separate
yes, my confusion its because the 2 roles are in the same mmr range
it will just obey the original order in which you added them
since there is nothing else distinguishing them
the bot basically sees them as equivalent and picks the first one
perfect
I'm looking forward to the update haha
yup same, bunch of refactoring on my end + some minor features
any new about the bot dm advertising the queue pop up feature?
autoping?
no, the feature we was talking the other day. When a queue start, like, all needed players join the queue al fill it up, the bot should send a dm to each user telling them the queue has started, and telling them to join the queue voice
something like this
oh gotcha
yea no word on that yet
thatll be good to add though
Yes, since many people do not read the mentions. Likewise, there are users who have server DMs disabled, but they are the minority
smth like this
thats perfect
aight maybe an update later tomorrow or saturday, will need to add a new queue config/command
will still update tomorrow morning without it
sound good
How do i add something like that under the map
Looks like a voting menu
```/votingmenu add ```
don't think so it's random but will try
nah didn't work
A voting menu can be random
Just enable force random üëç
How do i make it only 1 option
not 2 in 1 time
Make sure to put vote: All teams
It worked ty
1 more thing i used this command and after i used it the channel's name which has the queue in it always change to the number of the games we have played in the server
how do i disable it
Run it again without parameters
how the requeue priority per role works?
im reading the documentation but im not getting into it
and, there is any command to pause a queue? like, That when they touch to join the queue it tells them that it is temporarily paused?
you can pause the lobby countdown via `/lobbychannel pause`
if you add a requeue delay, people with priority will be able to skip the  delay
I mean to disable the join queue buttom
oh, `/lock`
Is there a way to automatically get data from the NeatQueue bot to be displayed in a google spreadsheet, for example games won by each player, mmr etc? Is this to be done with the API?
yes it can be done via the API: https://api.neatqueue.com/docs
ight thanks
someone did it a few months ago, lets see if i can find it
thanks would be helpful, if you cannot find it should I use the /api/playerstats?
<#857677776471588894>
but yea thats the API you want
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> im getting this error code Error code: ZHSHF
how many players are you doing?
Team size 16
2 teams
is there a. Limit ?
hm captains wont work with 32 people
too many buttons
how can we solve it
we can do random by bot ?
yea anything besides captains
How to switch players between teams ?
After queue start
I dont think that's a feature? I May be wrong
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to tell/logs of who voted for certain things?
So ik who falsely voted for MVPs alongside falsely voted wins
you can enable `/anticheat` to see who votes for  the incorrect winner
although there isnt really a "wrong vote" for MVP since its an opinion
Is there a way to make the bot only ping users who have not yet entered the voice channel? instead of everyone?
i mean this
the bot send the ping and then delete the message
good idea, ill include that with the DM update
when using the PlayerStatsAPI will it still get the data from all queues even if I do not specify in which queue the player is? For example: my Discord uses Rank X, Rank A, Rank B and Rank C each having a different queue + leaderboard.
Hello, I have a PUG matchmaker server for a 6v6 soccer game, i want to add a new feature where teams who have signed up with my server are able to queue with their scrim teams and matchmake with other teams who have queued.
how do i do this
I set the leaderboard to be monthly reset but November disappeared randomly. How can i fix it?
I guess you mean that if someone joins in your server they can access to the queue?
No, i want scrim teams to join a queue on their own channel (in my server), when they have 6 players in the queue, it will matchmake with another team which has also joined
do the 6v6 queue but with the queue type of full team vs full team
You can change it via /queuetype
if you mean the second API there, then yes it will be all queues
yeah
this is because the old stats weren't "November", they were all time stats
you should be able to use `/managestats copy` to move from the queuename to the november queue
if your queue name is Test it would look like
thoughts on if it should send it to all the players, or just the ones missing from the channel?
im thinking all of them, in case someone is just not paying attention to their discord
I'm guessing obviously that all player stats one should be the same?
wdym
to all of them when te queue fill
and then ping only the missing ones in the voice channels
<@145305657237700608> like, when the queue fill up, the bot should continue tagging everyone in the queue, because no all people have dms on
but in addition of that, the dm
yup i added a command to toggle it on, but it will DM all players
in addition, the ping button only pings players not in the voice
nice
The first option in the image you sent
Did that but still November didn‚Äôt show up
whats your server ID?
if I set to true the partyqueue prevention fill, what hapens if a party overfill a queue?
and btw, the topplayers function to autoassign roles based on lesderboard position, is not working propertly, like, its not updating sometimes and not giving the roles
the top 1 from tier 5 didnt join a match so he lose 10 mmr, he also lost the top 1 and now other player is in this place, the bot remove the role but didnt give it to the new top 1
if I do /autoroles refresh he got the role but i think that shouldnt work like that
ahh that makes sense, it only updates the roles for people in that match for when its cancelled
but that doesnt work for top players, it needs to check everyone again
the same situation for promotes
when a player promote to another tier the role got bug
now im doing /autoroles refresh and the bot is not assinging the role to anyone
could be rate limited on changing the roles
1151277895881334784
no, was my error, ive to refresh in the t5 queue
but, any solution about this?
yup about to update
<:refresh:1021953798542991410>
whats the queue name?
solo-lobby?
looks like it copied fine
it did execute it but the stats did not show in solo lobby ranking (used /leaderboard)
what do you see?
hit refresh
same
same if you use /leaderboard again?
Yes November is missing
It was fine before but yesterday it disappeared
Does making a new queue effect ? Because we made a new queue but with a different queue name
no that wouldnt change it
so you are saying when you use /leaderboard, its showing all time stats ?
After using the command ^
whats that channel ID?
1158100230437339257
<@145305657237700608> stats also got kinda messed up
i mean the queue channel
1151391320959614976
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1167272964505477171/1170457126871765033/image.png?ex=65591c25&is=6546a725&hm=5ed5bf6fae4c79746f69e52d3f0e7f163200163e692b292bda437f27a33a78e6&=
it would be good if the stats command shows the mmr to derank too
not only the rank up
hmm yea i dont want it to be cluttered
not sure how to lay it out
something like that?
and change the +56.8 MMR for the actual mmr
<@145305657237700608> can it be solved?
can someone help me setup the bot in my server for the que? im having a hard time getting it work the way it did in my server
take a look into the documentation
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/
yeah on site i did im still having a hard time
what problem u have?
how do i get it so that once they vote team captain and vote maps that it will drag them into vcs that the bot makes by itself ?
so you want the bot auto move the users into team voices?
try with /voicechannels moveteam
set it to true
how do i get rid of this
i copied a config from my old server and its saying this but we never had a certain role they had to have to join q
with /rolerequirement add
you should add a role to join the queue
its a bug that btw
hm yea if you copy a config with a role requirement, it might look strange since the role doesnt exist
uhhhh
im js having a hard time setting it up hold on
you should add a role for everyone that is going to join that queue
like the role for everyone in the server?
that everyone has or
okay
is there a way i can just test it with two ppl
use /teamsize 1
Could you possibly make it an option or like logs for ppl who vote for stuff or smth?
<@145305657237700608> is the bug with the "Im here" button still unfixed?
should be fixed
it would be cool to get in depth logs into everything
i‚Äôll think about a way to store and make that stuff public
because one players in in queue since 2 hours and the bot didnt quit him
and didnt send a dm
the timer is setted up for 1h
i probably updated in the middle
currently after an update it won‚Äôt resume the timer, need to fix
ahh ok
Hi, the api give me a Internal Server Error in '/api/outcome/winner' endpoint
In swagger it also fails
is the site down?
leaderboard not loading
https://www.neatqueue.com/lb/Tier2
<@145305657237700608> I saw only this is not working
the other tiers are working
any idea?
hmm that leaderboard loads fine for me
i run a pugs server and also play in the pugs but my mmr doesnt show up next to my name for the ratingnames
and i dont show up on the leaderboard
how do i make it where i do
What happens if u do /stats
are you the server owner
bots can‚Äôt nickname the server owner, so that‚Äôs why
just a discord rule
ah i see
thanks üòÑ
how can I see how much lobbys left to reach the daily limit?
In the API all post endpoints fails with internal server error üòî
`/serverstats info`
üò¶ ill check it tomorrow
<@145305657237700608> hey, any news on the leaderboard issue ?
how do i change it so you can be in queue for a certain amount of time before it kicks u from the queue
Good afternoon. I have a question about / autoroles mmr . Is it possible to set a limit on the minimum number of games to get a rank? By calibration type
/timer afk
but it doesnt show the daily games
daily games 47 isnt true
when the bot restarts that
if it is, its not adjusted with the new timezone I setup <@145305657237700608>
It restarts when the daily stats are posted on <#935731235790139422>
So you can see when the bot sends the message and see at what time it restarts for you
that won‚Äôt change with the time zone
<@145305657237700608> with high volume matches the leaderboard url crashes, and also the /lock command didnt work, like, it block the queue but when /unlock didnt unlock
high volume matches = 8 lobbys at the same time with 6 peoples each
that shouldnt really impact anything i imagine
whats the URL
and wdym the commands didnt work
https://www.neatqueue.com/lb/evento6humanos
right now its working, but sometime crash
you might just be refreshing too much?
when there are a lot of score reports at the same time
you would get rate limited
literally the queue didnt unlock
and the people cant join
there was 50 players queuing at the same time and i lock the queue
and when i tried to unlock, the join queue button still locked
did the command respond?
but the queue still locked
did you try again?
i will try at 5:50
because the second event ends
and will let u know
alright
mines 5:50, in 15 min
any idea why a tier 2 player that reach 800 mmr the bot remove his roles?
literally still without role, no tier 2 and no tier 1
only top 1 T2 role
this happens with all tiers that reach the top mmr
its because of the float number?
i think is that <@145305657237700608> since the limits are 600 and 601, 600.4 is in the middle
and get no roles
thats correct
you need to change the thresholds to be like 600-800, 800-2000, etc
no gaps
its going to work good with that?
because i remember i tested it and was broken
but ill test again
yup thats how it works
Is there a way to refresh stats ?
For some reason our stats changed and November stats disappeared
did you change the queue name?
No. I created a new channel with a new queue with a different name, added leaderboard channel and a results channel. After that everything changed
if you created a new queue with a new name, you wont have any stats
the bot is creating double channels
Bot is making duplicate channels for us as well
With the old queue still active?
same, and the #6351 is also ended
hello so i wanted to start using this bot for a league, but i wanna make it so that theres 2 teams per game, but it shows like 4 games (8 teams total), i dont want to have to make a queue for each, could i make 1 queue
its a bug, the dev will fix it soon
no im not having trouble with that
basically i want to make 4 different games/queues within 1 queue
i bet that isnt possible with the bot, but thought i would try
like u wanna start 2 matches at the same time?
yeah
like have 4 teams total, 1 team v 1 team, 1 team v 1 team, and have it all be in one queue
so its easiest to organize and handle
its basically for a league i wanna do
you can do `/numberoflobbies 2`
it will create 2 matches all at the same time
or just leave it at 1, and have them all queue up
when its set to 2 lobbies, it will wait for 4 full teams
now is there a way then to do it so each team has to go a specific lobby?
so **Team 1** is supposed to play against **Team 2** so they should go in **LOBBY 1**
also is there a way yet to make it so theres an mmr for players and teams?
it will automatically setup the 2 matches
no its only per player
what if i wanted to make each lobby specific teams? so team 1 will be playing against team 3, etc.
is that too complicated or can the bot do that?
when people join the queue, there are no "teams"
so im not quite sure what you mean
it will split the players up so they can make teams
im not gonna worry about it, but how do i remove team names i made under my name
like i made all these, but now i want to delete them
`/party disband`
aah so i was talking about parties, basically i want to formulate it so that a certain party goes against another specific party
and i want to make it so 8 parties are all in 1 queue, but theres 4 organized matches that for each match, 2 parties go against each other
<@145305657237700608> basically I want to make permanent teams like in the tournament mode, but make it for regular queues
So it basically skips the team picking process
Dont think thats really possible, make different matches from 1 queue at once, you will have to set a queue that is just only party vs party
The queue type is full team vs full team
Yeah that‚Äôs unfort, alright thank you all
Admin from 4KT TM's here. Looking to upgrade to premium as we have hit the cap 2 days in a row.
https://www.neatqueue.com/
Cannot find any support on how to do that.
Login and Dashboard :]
Thank you!
It is completed üôÇ
Hope you enjoy premium perks ü´°
<@145305657237700608> Hey i need some help, i sent informations from DM. Can you check it when u are available thank you
<@145305657237700608> can multiple discord admins use the NeatQueue Bot if so, how? One of my fellow Admins cannot use Admin only commands even tho he has Admin permissions on the server
/staffrole add i believe allows a certain role to have access to all commands
yay i can get my perms
then we have to figure out our API thing... being a nightmare
yes thanks
how can i get my neatqueue api key?
any help?
You just can add one number
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=api
how do i only give /party creation features to some individuals
The API post endpoints still broken üíî
Especially /outcome/*
you can customize the permissions in the Server Integration settings
weird i didn‚Äôt see any errors, i‚Äôll check it out again
Is the api working?
getting error 401
i want help
just drop your questions
okay
I want to know how to add pictures to the map
And random distribution of players
you have the image url parameter on /map add
The bot creates both a text channel and two voice channels for my queues, how do I make it so people with a certain role can see the text channels that are created without having to be in the queue?
for the text channels you should use this
for voice channels you should use this
Thanks
401 is unauthorized, which is an expected error
how can a sub a player of a match that is already reported?
<@145305657237700608> ?
Sub a player in a match that is already ended?
Not possible
it would be cool if its avaiable on next updates
Wait let me check
that wont work no
but why would you want that?
we have a cryteria for subs
if the sub play more games that the subbed player, he got the mmr change, win/lose
if he play lower games than the subbed, he dont get the mmr change, the subbed player gets the lose/win
like, if you sub me and the serie is best of 5 and you left in the 1 match, i will get the lose/win, if you sub in the 4 match, the subbed player will get the lose/win
because he play more games
Just started a queue and got Dm'ed is there a way to stop that?
`/matchstart dmplayers toggle:Disabled `
did you understand neatz?
or my explanation was weird
haha
no i get what you mean
<:Shrug:1171270284670668830>
I understand that changing a player after a match affects the mmr distribution calculation and that can be a problem
but I think it is a useful option
thanks, i have no idea why that's just started, it's never happened before in 45 queues
its a new thing, did you make a new queue?
At the moment u can just add and remove mmr manually to get what you trying
ill check out what it would look like it allow subbing after a match
sound good
Yes, that's what I did, it's just a little uncomfortable
My leaderboard has been wipped for some reason tonight
is ther a way I can get that back
or failing that, is there a way i can see the full history of games that were played in the server
Like for example, i can see there way games inbetween my queue number 4 and queue number 9 but i cant see the details of that in my results channel
did you change the queue name
i did accidentally restart the queue, it has the same name though
i think...
you're so right
i've fixed it now by changing the name back
nice <:thumb:711064979012321290>
it was so subtle-ey different
thanks for your help
no prob
In /api/outcome/winner give an error 400 like this:
```json
{
  "detail": "Could not fetch server"
}
```
in my request the body its this and i use the api code in header:
```json
{
  "match_number": 8,
  "team_num": 1
}```
Maybe the command `/webhooks generatetoken` dont work?
is the bot in that server?
hm alright
When I go into a queue with people, the option for captains isnt there anymore how do i fix this?
Hi <@145305657237700608> , how can i fix stats disappearing? November stats are no longer seen in leadesboards
what did you change?
/teamselection
fix will be out tomorrow morning
bot is not updating for 4KT TMs. Queue is not responding .
Didn‚Äôt change anything related to that queue name. I only added a new queue with a different queue name, after that MMR‚Äôs/wins/losses changed and November leaderboard disappeared
<@145305657237700608> currently any matches we play are reflecting in ‚ÄúAll Time Stats‚Äù
topplayers autoroles are not refreshing good
ive to manually refresh them
ive setted up 1 for each tier for the top 1 and is not updating propertly
btw, <@145305657237700608> is the new spanish translation up?
wdym, whats it doing
and yea the new translations should be up
it is not updating
ive to manually refresh it with /autoroles refresh
never?
no, sometimes it updates good, but sometime also hours go by and they are not updated
Wouldn't it be appropriate to do a /refresh after each score report?
thats what it currently does
whats  the server + queue name?
Could it be when someone plays at a lower tier and comes first on their table?
like, im tier 2, you tier 3, i play a queue on tier 3 and got top 1 on tier 2 leaderboard
it updates the roles of the queue only right?
I think thats the problem
1151277895881334784

Solo-lobby
when a match ends, it will recalculate all the top roles for that queue
yes, thats because is not working when i play on a lower tier queue
because its not my main queue
like, tier 3 queue affects on my mmr but as the queue is different the tier 2 queue didnt know that
autoroles are a per-queue configuration though
it wouldnt really make sense to update other stuff outside the queue
sorry whats the queue channel ID  as well
in our case yes because we have 2 queues per tier, there is any way to refresh all autoroles from all queues?
or selected queues
hmm i guess it could maybe refresh all queues with the same name
it doesnt make a ton of sense though
all tiers have the same queue name
because is a "global" mmr
say you are 5000 MMR and play in the 1000 MMR queue, you would instantly get the top 1 role
no because the leaderboard of the 1000 MMR queue ignores your role
gotcha
tier 3 leaderboard ignores tier 2 players roles
but tier 2 players can play on tier 3
like, this is the set up for each tier, at the bottom the top 1 role, and each tier leaderboard only allows players with the assigned tier role, and ignore all others
Yea so your Top 1 role is only for tier 2
we cant refresh all the queues
tier 2 has his own top 1, tier 3 his own top 1
it would give someone else the role
the problem is that, a tier 2 player can reach top 1 playing on tier 3 (on the tier 2 leaderboard)
and that dont refresh the tier 2 queue
gotcha
so it would just need to refresh each
yes, summary, a match on tier 2, should update autoroles from tier 1 and 2, a match on tier 3 should update autoroles from tier 2 and 3
i know its not possible rn, but any idea how can I fix that?
ok yea thats fine then since its the same stats
ill update it so it refreshes all queues with the same name
sound good

looks like the most recent match was fine?
Hiya, I'm trying to set up a new server with a queue system in which players can have a continuous option to force start, something akin to ready-up. I tried having the forcestart config timer set as low as possible (even 0) and it should start as soon as 2 players are in queue but it still takes a full 3 minutes to even ping
I'd prefer this to relying on players to know to use the "/forcestart" command
Also, is there some way to force start at 6 every time but have more role options? There are more roles in the game than players required, but I don't want people to join a queue full of the same role and be disappointed
if you want to start when it hits 2 players, you can just set the team size to 1
ah ok, thanks. Anythin g I can do about the lengthy wait time?
What time?
the forcestart vote takes like 3 minutes to produce a vote prompt, even on a cooldown of 0
Why would you forcestart on 1v1 queue?
Do you have your queue type on matchmaking?
so the game is for casual custom lobbies, I want people to be able to vote to start in anything from a 1v1 to a 3v3 if the wait is going on too long
but I don't want to rely on people being savvy enough to know "/forcestart"
So basically something akin to "ready-up" where if everyone is good to go the option to start is available
or a hacky alternative
They need to do the /forcestart
Have you changed forcestart conditions
I tested it and it works fine with 0 cooldown
hmmmm weird, let me try one more time
Nothing pops-up
is this a test mode issue maybe? regardless, it showed-up after like 3 minutes last time when I tested with another person
oh, literally just got it
Matches working fine.. what we are facing is November leaderboard disappeared and stats for players randomly reset/changed
how to disable MMR ?
Theres not an actual command for that
You can either enable the disable mmr button before a match starts, or you can change the mmr change to 0 and lose to 0 and put the static on ture
setting the mmr change to 0 should be good enough <:thumb:711064979012321290>
<:PepeYesSign:1171266936651399279>
thanks
I want to know auto move channel voice
You want to know? <:hmm:1172617247320195123>
Or you wanna enable them
enable
Wich one you want
auto move
From queue voice channel to team channels thats by default
another question im the owner of my server but my name also doesnt pop up on the leaderboard is that also not changeable?
Have u played any games?
yeah
a lot
hmm weird
at first
it used to work
but then randomly it stopped
and i dont remember changing anything for it to make it stop
Since when did that happen
Does it work normally, have u tried to re send the leadearboard?
its on every leaderboard
and on my stats my rank says N/A
that would mean you have no stats in that queue
<@145305657237700608> any new about the top players autoroles refresh?
yes, it should be updated
as of like an hour ago
What was the command to remove a Que
/endqueue
is it working well?
thank u
nice
we dont talk abt the
red carpet
i kept getting put into bad teams
and as the server owner i cant complain üíÄ
hmm, did you add any leadeaboard role requirement for leaderboard or any role ignore
as staff, is there a way or command to pick on behalf a captain? <@145305657237700608>
as i know this is a discord bug,  a work around to this would be great
Hi guys, long time no see üòÑ
quick question I,ve set roles (i wanted them to be able to join queue however they can join team channel even if not in the queue, any tips?
and somehow these are the team channel permisions
im also wondering if this might be discord issue as the category where the channels are created is set as visible for these roles
nvm i guess i solved it
Hi! Could someone help me to figure out how to make it where only staff are able to revert/cancel matches?
thats the default behavior, its locked away behind the staff role
no there is not way for that
What about a command that picks players that only captains can use
The glitch is disturbing and we cannot solve it
is there a way to make it where a certain role can only sub but not add or remove mmr?
You mean /player sub?
You cant set a role that only can use certain commands
yeah
thats the thing the people in my community are slow and if they need to leave they wont get a sub. understood. i have hosts that host the queues but i dont give them perms to sub bc when i add staff to it they can also add and remove mmr etc which i dont want
if u dont mind can u show me how to give certian commands to roles
Thats not really possible yet
Soon it will be
yup working on it now
will be available tomorrow probably
Hi, after the queue starts and all options are selected, how do i display a message at the final message (i.e. telling the players the IP to connect to)
The ip is a variable i guess, so you cant really send a message through the bot
someone previously in a server that i helped run was using the neatqueue bot and had the layout like the screenshot below, but at the bottom of it, he put text that specified how to join the server
That's a custom lang override then, its a premium feature to change neatqueue's text
i have premium now, i thought it was the footer but the footer changes even the text prior to the queue being finished
What do you wanna change?, the text "Today at 9:08 AM?
no, i want to add to match details
you can use `/lobbydetails`
and add a custom message which shows at the bottom
this is from `/map` though
`/votingmenu` results also show here
i‚Äôll try those, thank you
We haven't used the bot in a while and everyone still has old roles how do I remove all the roles please?
/autoroles reset to eliminate the configs, idk if it will remove the role from the user tho
tysm
I remember neatz telling me before that if I set auto roles to certain values it wouldn't work, are these values ok?
no you should update it so its 1-500, 500-1000, 1000-1500, etc
dont want any gaps
thank you
hi, is there any way I can set up a 'muted' role to work well with the neatqueue queue channels? right now the member specific perms that are given in the queue channel override the role perm of not being able to send messages.
By neatqueue channels you mean the temp ones that it creates?
you can use `/tempchannels permissions` to make sure that the muted role cant speak
thank you
old b3d player, right?
yeah
still remember that truck threat to the community lol
how do I show mmr next to name again?
/ratinginname format
thanks very much
idea: create a preset for a staff role called moderator, who can only execute /ban /outcome /player sub and other basic commands
i know its easy to set up manually but would be great if its also created and you can select that preset
how do I set an MMR floor?
please
/mmr minimum
<@145305657237700608> about of these, there is any way to disable all admin commands for a staff role and assign only 3/4 commands?
because ive to deny 1 per 1 and it takes a lot of time
there is an optional argument for the default
which you can say "no commands"
like, i want to give a moderator the role and only execute 5 or 6 commands
so i have to put, no commands and then set up manually?
and btw, if I put no commands, is only for admin commands right?
the normal commands will continue working
exactly
it will be a staff role with no extra staff commands
so basically just a default role
but, whats the command?
staffrole command deny?
i mean, the one ive to put "no commands"
`/staffrole add`
if I select /player, it will allow all /player commands?
btw, it would be great if the autoping allows to tag 2 or more roles instead of only 1
and, how this works? like, if you are not a staff role and you click revert/cancel it will cancel the game?
or has any permission comprobation
wait the way he set it up is wrong?
bc i did that
for like
700 queues
and every once ina while poeple would just lose their ranks
thats probably why
well those are my new ranks
cuz if you are 149.7 MMR, they wouldnt get a rank
AHHH
I SEE
so for example for prospect lower rating would be 149 rating to get it would be 150 and rating to lose it would be 300?
but once someone gets 300 they get challenger
yup no gaps
but lose challenger at 299?
yea, at 299.9999999999
oh crap
do i gotta
put that many 9s
okay
just do 300
thanks al ot
sorry for all the questions
no prob
lower bound is inclusive, upper bound is exclusive
wait
so for immortal
nah ncm
i do the same thing
thank you once again
immortal just do 2000 -> 9999999
nah once someone hits immortal ima just start the new season
the ppl on team 1 can still join team 2
can anyone help me
do you have a spectator role?
i have admin but the regular players are able to join team 2 when their on team 1
or when a new que is made, anyone can join the que.
did you disable channel restrictions
i dont think so
if a mod has acces to this channel but default user perms, can cancel the match or revert the score? <@145305657237700608>
hmm i forgot about that
it won't let them use the buttons
ill update it so it uses the same permissions as the command
whats the command?
just to assign it
`/outcome`
and to change the winner team?
`/outcome selectwinner`
nice, ty
just a suggestion, I think changing the name of this command to /cancel game it would be more intuitive
i know the cancel is for users, but I think it will be better
or something like /forcecancel /forcestop
I think outcome is good, bc its the outcome of the game, the final "score"
`/cancel game` and `/cancel` are not possible to both exist, also that would be a bit confusing
the reason the commands are grouped together is cuz we only get 100 unique base command names, and I think im currently at like 98 or something
ohhh ok, makes sense
btw, the spanish translation is up?
like the updated
from when
I think he means the dm command ones idk
mmm, weeks ago
i believe it should all be live
ok ill try it
<@145305657237700608> what about the option we talked the other day, about canceling or changing scores of an already reported game?
thats possible
but not subbing
i mean subbing, sry
Hey <@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> How to sub players from team 1 to team 2 and vise versa? 

Tried using /player sub with game num but it gives me that no matches were found
Are u trying to do it when the match has ended?
And i dont think you can sub from team 1 to team 2
Match already ended yes
I think this feature is necessary because people sometimes mistakenly choose or agree to switch teams after conclusion of the team picking
You can't sub when a match already ended
Is there any other way?
If youre trying to sub to give some mmr, then you have to do it manually by /mmr add, but theres no any way to sub a player from 1 team to another and sub isnt available when the match already ended
Tried doing that manually, but encountered that decrements using /add win -1 will just give you a loss rather than removing a win
<:hmm:1172617247320195123>  It works for me
hey, i have added my league directors/mods  as staffrole, they used to be able to modify the results but cannot anymore. They can still change things like teamsize though.
hmm i thought existing staff roles should still have full access to the buttons
can they use `/outcome`?
<@648635725964902411> it counted that as a tie
Didnt it already have a tie?
wdym counted as a tie
oh, those commands are pretty low level
you will need to subtract a game as well
got it thanks
No no
how can I generate a token for the api <@145305657237700608> ?
what is the expiration time of a token?
Doesnt have i think so
Never seen this before, what is it?
It says the error
heat death of the universe <:thumb:711064979012321290>
I tried reset and clear, it didnt work
did you end the queue? or someone else?
i did
It also said, that it ended the queue. But we cant join anymore
yes when you end the queue, its no longer available to be joined
but since its still visible i thought it was
do i just have to start it again? with /start or something
you pretty much shouldnt end the queue ever
use /config list to get the old queue code, then use /load
ill try my best ty
why is my which team won vote showing in the same channel as the queue? its supposed to create a temp queue text channel
`/tempchannels toggle mode:Enabled `
any idea why no one can see the temp text channel to vote winners? they say they cant see it at all. only admins seem to be able to
Btw. can i change the winner of the last queue even though they voted already for the wrong team?
`/outcome`
Since when is neatqueue adding new roles to certain players who join the queue? it never happened before
Since never
u must or someone added autoroles? or something
I did not add any i just loaded in old queue settings and now its adding "new role" to players who join the queue. Do you know how to turn that off?
try /autoroles reset
Not working, still giving the roles
did it create the role or what
It gives the role called "new role" to everyone who joins the queue, and removes it once u left the queue
that would be `/autoroles inqueue`
mustve been in whatever config you loaded
That worked ty.
I loaded the queue we lastly used and we never had that adding roles issue before, since i loaded it, it was adding the roles. Could be i did something wrong, but was more like a "bug" if you could call it like that.
Ty anyways
more like a bug fix, its supposed to correctly load the autoroles
it wasn't working correctly until like last week
for some reason
2 queues keep popping up
Its the same queue
Maybe it bugged
how the "duration": 315360000, works in the api? for player ban
btw <@145305657237700608>
the ban player endpoint is giving internal server error
it‚Äôs number of seconds to ban for
amd what about the internal server error?
i‚Äôll check it out when i‚Äôm back later today
ok ty
the api still getting internal server error
any idea?
yea i have a fix for tomorrows update
nice ty
<:hmm:1172617247320195123> neatqueue doesnt have video games
What does he mean
whats the difference between api and api2?
like, whats the difference between that 3 endpoints
nothing, just renamed endpoints
i should probably clean it up
probs like a year back i changed the return format for the leaderboard
Hii can someone help me I set +40 for win and -30 for lose and I set starting mmr 1000 and when someone hit 1099 he get role or if he droped under 1000 he ger role but idk why bot is not giving roles can someone help me pls
or have can I know I have setted roles for 1000-1099elo etc
check your /info
one of the pages shows your autoroles
Yeah i see
can I change the staff results channel after setting up the queue? if so, can someone help me with the command
when I try to use this, the command doesn't work. Has it been changed to something else?
Its the same
Just remove the one you got, and set a new one, /staffchannel you can see the two commands
hello, does neatqueue have some form of character selection phase?
the bot is awesome but i'd love to collect data about character picks
it has character/hero bans, but there isn't a way to add character selection per player
i see, is there plans for a char select option?
Thank you so much, it's working know!
not currently
only since i believe it would be for a specific team right, so the team can just figure it out in their channel?
its more to register data about pickrate and character win rate
than to validate the process
gotcha gotcha
there was a similar request in <#911057745204105237>
how do i reset the leaderboard and everyones mmr
`/managestats resetstats`
hey, id like to remove the queue, as in delete. testing some stuff, and i only find a command to clear players not deleting
/endqueue
is there a way to change where the temp voice channels are created? I want them to be made in a different category than the main vc category
How do you change someone's MMR that isn't in the server anymore? Discord ID doesnt work
/channel category
You really cant ig
Is there any way to implement having a queue with 12 ppl but only 8 get picked. I'd do anything to have that option
Also streak multipliers aren't working to my queue rn, I enabled but I'm not seeing them being added
Nope
My streak multipliers aren't working to my queue rn, I enabled but I'm not seeing them being added
I made sure the elo isn't static too
I set the mmr to be +25 for a win, -18 for a loss, but I just wanted a streak multiplier for wins. If I turn off static will it do that?
how creat random team ?
/teamselection
okay
auto move ?
member voice
How do the priority role work?
Like if its 4v4 and 8 are already in the queue could a role with priority take a spot?
voice team to team channels its by default
When the  starts, I want the bot to transmit all the teams in the voice
thats by default
everyone must join the queue channel
Is there no cmd to move everyone?
wdym?
"/misc startwhen Forcestarted: When matches can only be forcestarted, the number of players can exceed the maximum queue size. Players who join the queue with priority will take precedence in the queue over lower priority players." <@648635725964902411> is this a way to give a certain role a priority to in the matches over another?
Is there any way to add a sort of ranked system for the mmr
yea /requeue priorityrole
that‚Äôs kind of how it works by default
if you mean different ranks for MMRs, check out /autoroles
Hey! tested out the bot for my 10mans today, worked great but i have a question
observing the matches i had no way to see who was picked or won the MVP, i think it was never announced in the queue channel either. is there a way to see
it‚Äôs probably cuz nobody got the required amount
it usually shows in the winner message
So if I just split it into Pro / AM how do I add those roles and then give the Pros priority
Is that something where I should switch to matchmaking and then give Pros the priority
Ah sorry for not making it more explicit or elaborating, I meant as in when a person hits a certain elo rating, that category has a name
Kind of like GM, bronze, silver gold etc
I‚Äôve set up the auto roles but I‚Äôd like it to be shown in the stats card
how do i get premium?
neatqueue.com, log in and go to dashboard
Thank you
In a matchmaking queue, is it still able to do captains and draft the teams? Or does it automatically do that
How does one auto send people to voice channels when queue is finished I just had to cancel a game because people didn‚Äôt join vc
If you mean a voice channel that isnt deleted, set a /lobby
When queue is full, people will be dragged from that channel and when the queue is finished it will return them
But idk why do you say you had to cancel a game when queue was finished (?)
is there a way to bypass this screen and force vote for captains?
told you on <#911057745204105237>
Is there a way so that if I have a lobby with 5 people from my server and 3 randoms, can I still run the game and have a winning vote / give elo to winning team without the 3 randoms having to join the server, hope I‚Äôve explained the question well enough
how to make it so that players cant queue for another game until their game ends
Thats by default
naw u can vote for ur team and then join the q idk why
you can change it with `/requeue condition`
thanks
by default, the only requirement is voting
Can the NeatQueue bot allow players to choose multiple roles (preferred and second preferred) when it comes to a 5vs5 League of Legends custom game? For instance, a player might prefer the support role but also be willing to play as a jungler. The issue I‚Äôm referring to arises when many people queue up as support and the queue doesn‚Äôt start because not all roles are filled.
Hi! Just started using neatbot in my sever for 1v1 matchmaking! Does anyone have any tips regarding preconfigs? I tried to look up tutorials for best mmr settings, but came up flat. If anyone has advice for ideal permissions to configure for 1v1s please lmküôèü§ù
What are you struggling with
We have a basic guide
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
Dont think neatqueue has that option
Do you plan adding it?
So assignment of captains can't be forced to vote each time?
I don't need balanced, highest rated, lowest rated , and random options as we always vote for captains
NeatZ has the decision, it needs to go trough a general votation by eveeyone
I already told you the command was /teamselection, and only select captains
<:hmm:1172617247320195123>
This does not resolve my issue.
What are you trying then
please read above
/captains selection
Thank you! I will try that
<@145305657237700608> bump
no it‚Äôs not possible, it would be a bit complicated to add as well
can‚Äôt people just switch the roles if a spot is needed?
can I see what roles are taken when I already queued up?
The functionality of the bot is AWESOME but I'm having issues configuring the content that's displayed to the user in the queue. Like the hot isn't instructing the players in q to press anything. Advice with this config would be ideap
yea it will show how many are queued in each role
wdym instructing them to press anything?
you just have to join the queue basically
Ok so once the player is in the q I want to display a win option
ye I know whenever the problem occurred someone had to leave the queue and join again
You cant display a win option if the queue is not even filled to start a game
maybe a ‚Äúswitch role‚Äù button would work fine
and would be very easy to add
Like once the queue is full, in my case 2 players in total for 1v1, I'm tryna to figure out how to configure what the hot outputs to those specific users
What are u trying to show
Its basically, queue fill „Äãgame starts „Äãand then the option to vote winner
Yeah ok so I'm getting to the point if the game starting, but nothing outputing those in q
Not even getting a win/lose option
<:hmm:1172617247320195123>
You see channels creating right
And you go to the channel you get pinged
What does it say
I'm tryna to figure out how to modify this content^^
sorry this is so beginner haha
it‚Äôs cuz you have 1 team i believe?
it won‚Äôt show any win or loss
change the /numberofteams
word ill try that out
now i have 2 teams... and its 2v2... how would i make it so its 1v1 XD
aka how can i edit player size per team?
/teamsize
and how do I cancel test queues?
Cancel in wich way
Cancel a game?, cancel the test mode?
If you wanna cancel the test mode do /test again
bet thats what i meant
thanks for the help boys
hey so my queue type is matchmaking but im getting this... how do i make it so the queue just serves for 1v1 and to keep score
use /teamselection and pick balanced
does /forcestart allow games to go thru if its 9/10 players in queue?
and make the game a 5v4?
depends on the /forcestartconfig
by default i believe yes
but you can make it so it can only be forcestarted if the teams will be the same size
kk thx
Hi! Is there any way to make it so it will generate more than one map per queue?
Like
currently it onyl generates 1 map
could I make it so that way it generates multiple, say 5?
you can change the `/bestof`, and it will show like Map 1, Map 2, etc
it says with voting disabled? how do we decide who wins?
it means the "best of" vote is disabled
otherwise it will show a vote where the players can pick how many maps to play
Sounds good! Tysm!
possible bug ?

My queue type is setup as:
```
Queue Type
PUGs/Normal Individual Queue
```

But yet, when clicking Join, its asking me to select a team ?
A team or a party?
it says Team
Do /party disband
thanks
hello i have it setup so that there is a streak multiplier. is there a way to set multiplier for if a team is on a streak and then they a defeated. if the team that won could get a bonus for taking them down
How can I send an automatic message in every queue¬¥s chat
(not the /lobbydetails set)
Dont think its possible
I want to do test
starting
<@648635725964902411>
Do /test
how do u make it where after a queue ends people are moved to a specific vc?
You made the queue global?
/lobbychannel set
yeah thanks
i was looking back at my message history lmao
Then you cant test
Its like that <:Shrug:1171270284670668830>
<:hmm:1172617247320195123>
globalqueues have more restricted settings
since it‚Äôs shared across servers
also my Neatqueue is changing peoples nicknames now, how do i disable this? i did give the neatqueue bot admin privileges
you probably don‚Äôt want to use it honestly
adding their MMRs?
yeah
but i dont want that
disable /ratinginname
it‚Äôs off by default
match log
<:hmm:1172617247320195123>
/staffchannel
how do u change the mmr of a specific person
also how to disable neatqueue from sending DMs to people once a queue is created
`/set mmr` or `/add mmr`, depends on what you want to
`/matchstart dmplayers`
how do you reset a leaderboard?
A leadearboard its the stats display, so you will need to reset stats
You can reset all the stats of everyone by `/managestats reset`
Thank You
I don't want this waiting period
I want these points in a specific channel
Sorry what was the command to delete a que üò≠
_/resultschannel_
_/endqueue_ i think ü§î
`/voicechannels mode ` optional
i want remvoed point everyone player
I dont understand what you said
I want to delete all points from all players
for some reason when you join the queue it doesnt display names anyone know how to fix this?
https://i.imgur.com/HU7NHoL.png
/ management resetstats all
Thats a matchmaking queue
Do you want that?
i guess not. the way im organizing it is that its like a ranked system that auto starts when theres 8 people in queue for 2 teams of 4 and creates balanced teams. as a mod for the server i wanna make sure certain people are in the queue at a time. would i have to change it to PUGs? would it still create balanced teams based off rank that way?
you can turn off `/anonymousqueue` which is enabled by default for matchmaking
but you sound like you want the PUGs mode
which would automatically start at 8 people
oh awesome thank you so much !
Hey guys! Bots been working great but I have a question regarding mmr config. I‚Äôm tryna use the bot for 1v1 and 2v2 matches, and I was wondering if you guys know of any common mmr ranges with a similar setup. Any help would be ü§ùü§ù
1v1 and 2v2 queue isnt really difficult to set up, what are u struggling with?
How do you get premium
It‚Äôs capped a discord for us at 50 games a day
neatqueue.com, log in and go to dashboard
I've just done that, even bought the credits required for the 5 credit premium plan
I try select an option and it doesn't work?
scroll down here, there is a "Confirm" button i believe
I'm on mobile
you cant scroll?
I guess it's not mobile compatible website
Nope
Not to a confirm button
Can scroll just under the final select button but that's it
yea i guess it doesnt scroll well in that popup
Far as I get if I hold my finger to. Scroll
Check DMs
Also the link doesn't work for me when it says we've run out of queues lol
were u logged in
Yeah
Not that I‚Äôm having trouble setting it up, what I need is more of a suggestion of what is an ideal range for whr, and how I should go about setting up appropriated points earned/points deducted
I got everything working, I just want like the range between lowest auto role and highest auto role to be feasible
One player in my queue has set his IGN to something that isn't his IGN
do i have the ability to wipe it myself or change it myself?
you can use `/set ign`
What do I type after that
If his discord is @abc and his IGN is "XYZ"
I have this because I don't know what it's expecting me to type
Youre not specifying the user
Do I need to @ them?
like idrk what i need to type in
when i do /set ign it just gives me an empty box
You have more parameters
Ah i see
thanks
how do I add game modes?
You can add gamemodes on maps
/map add
hey so i have too many queues listed for leaderboards, how do I remove extra queues
/managestats resetstats all and the queue name
that worked thanks!
how do i get neat to give leader of the server mmr in name?
the server owner?
yeah
neatqueue cant change discord owners nickname i think so
okay
If two queues have the same name they have the same leaderboard system right?
correct
If a new queue is made after the other one, and is named the same, after a game is played that‚Äôs when the leaderboard updates?
stats are updated whenever a match is finished
i have made a rank system set up with autorole like this "Bronze - 0-200mmr , Silver - 200-300mmr, Gold - 300-400mmr, Platinum - 400-550mmr, Diamond - 550mmr and up" 
is it possible to make it so that there is a monthly reset that only resets you to the start of the rank role you are in?  Example: if someone gets 1000mmr they get reset back to 550 rather than the set starting 100mmr after the month is over?
Dont think so
ah alright thank you so much though im loving how advanced i can get with the bot !
np, if theres a way to do what youre trying to, neatz will type :)
ty ty if not ill throw it in feature requests as i think it would be a great feature if possible to do
For leaderboard, is there a way to have it so 2 leaderboards are shown in one channel? Both leaderboards are a different queue tho
have you tried / link ?
Yes but it only works for one leaderboard it seems
oooohhh
no its not possible
if you enable leaderboard monthly resets, and you set the starting MMR for each role, i think that should work
thank you ill give it a try!
If map selection is set to ‚Äúrandom‚Äù, is there a feature to vote to skip the map selected at random to the next random map? Or would i have to cancel the match and have it choose at random again?
there's no way to get a new random map once its picked
you could just manually pick a map and disregard what it said though
Yah that‚Äôs the thought we had. Is it possible to add a feature like that to enable and disable? Or is that something not possible.Thank you for the fast reply üëçüèº
yea maybe, there is already a similar thing with random teams and random captains
what command do this look for `stats`?
Its on the image
/stats
i know, but i have this image or all time working only after 2 games?
I have no idea why it shows without the graph tbh
I dont understand, are u saying it doesnt show the graph or what are u trying to say
yes, command stats doesnt show the graph
Hmm idk why
If it use it for old players it shows the graph
you need to have at least 2 matches in 2 diff days to show the graph
oh, thx
If teams are randomed, when it asks if teams are valid/fair is there a way to increase the number of votes for it to be considered fair/unfair. For example 2 teams of 3, minimum votes for it to be fair is 4 (3 from 1 team, and 1 from the other team)
/requiredvotes default
Also if I do /statsbutton I want to make it so the bot sends a hidden message rather than public message, or have it send a public one but delete after a few minutes
I doubt there is a way to do this but it would be a cool feature
you can enable /hidestats
but that hides it every time someone uses /stats as well
Man how are ya'll this far! There's so much! haha <@145305657237700608> thank you for this wonderful bot!  My situation and question is - I need to make multiple queues for multiple divisions/ ranking levels, can I copy and paste a queue I create in one part of my channel to another? Is there also a master queue area where i can update all queues at once if needed, say when map rotations update?
You can do /save and /load to copy queues
<@648635725964902411> you‚Äôre the best . Does this work separately across each area of the Discord? 

For example. I make the original queue in the ‚ÄúSweaty 8s‚Äù channel. 
Then I ‚Äî
/save ‚ÄúX‚Äù 
And then I ‚Äî
 /load ‚ÄúX‚Äù in a completely different channel say ‚Äúadvanced-8s‚Äù 

Will Queue X only use info from the channel it‚Äôs used in regardless of how many channels it‚Äôs been copy and pasted into or will it grab from all channels, compile and affect MMR and stats across the channels?

 And if not could I save/edit it as a different queue version/name if I wanted without affecting the originals?
If the queues have the same name, they will share stats no matter if they are in separate channels
So you will need to rename each different queue (depending on what you want)
Perfect that‚Äôs great
Thank you Don üî•
I‚Äôm on mobile at the moment I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm not on premium on my other account‚Ä¶ is there a trial to try it or no?
You bought premium?
<@648635725964902411> now im on my home pc
give me a sec
That‚Äôs what I see atm
<@648635725964902411>
sorry what are you asking?
i got it i got it. The "x" threw me off a bit. And the fact that it says premium there made me think I was on a trial of premium. I just upgraded. Thank you for this!
trial is an interesting idea, i think that would be cool
<@145305657237700608> Also I understand the order command with map selection but Is there anyway to make specific game numbers a certain gametype ?
for example in Halo

The playlist goes -

Obj
Slayer
Obj
Obj
Slayer
Obj
Slayer
When its in comp settings
which I follow in the cord
In the current state we have to vote for slayer to be 2.5,7 and its a given 99% of the time.
The problem lies in giving the voting ability at all in my case because...well some people hate some gametypes and thats not where we want to go in vetong it out
are you requeuing after every map?
i tried to order it but again the problem would be that EVERY queue would have the same exact structure. and there are 5/6 gametypes in Halo
aand no i am not
i‚Äôm confused then
is it not the same order for every match?
not it isnt ever the same order
always changing
the only thing that stays is the slayer position
are you using ordered selection?
OBJ is either Flag Oddball SHolds KotH
Yes i tried
but the order would be the same every time which we dont want
and doesnt happen
OBJ position above is always changing and weighed randomly in comp settings
since it includes so many Gametypes it wouldnt be played in Bo5 since slayer takes spots 2 and 5
so the gamemodes are not the same every match
they are not
they are only the same on spots 2, 5, 7 as slayer
Also is there to consistently notify and update the channels how many people are in queue?
How do I cancel a queue that accidentally started?
A game I mean
So like players are already in the lobby/vcs
/cancel or /outcome cancel
you can make a channel that its name will be updated in how many players are in queue by /serverstars inqueue
So I accidentally cancelled the queue
Rather than the current game
And peoples mmrs are at 1000
I lost the neatqueue key, which is probably my fault
what key?
Like I cancelled the entire queue
So it stopped everything and it usually gives u a config key
do `/config list`
How do I start that queue once I got the config?
`/config load`
ok ok i finally see what you mean
there isn‚Äôt really a way to achieve that then
Got it no problem <@145305657237700608> I did just have a problem with queuing‚Ä¶ my guys on Xbox tried to change lobbies but it didn‚Äôt show on their Xbox discords screen and crashed their game ü§î
That sounds like is not related with the bot tbh
yea if discord crashes that isn‚Äôt on me lmao
I've heard discord on xbox its buggy aswell
<:Shrug:1171270284670668830>
I‚Äôll tell em to get their pc already
can you kick anyone out of the queue?
`/player remove`
when giving the bot all of the manage channel permissions and all other permissions other than administrator, and make sure the bot role is at the top of the role list, i'm still getting a permissions error
so i have neat queue in my server but need a lot of help setting it up
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
how is it possible to setup the leaderboard in a seperate channel? If i try to load leaderboards in a different channel this shows up:
/link
My neatqueue is making new roles for some reason
I had that happen as well I believe
/autoroles inqueue
Execute it w/o params to disable
you probably loaded a config which had autoroles
could be any of the autoroles
<:PepeYesSign:1171266936651399279>
will i get the manage permissions error if the channels are private?  i keep getting the error even after giving the bot all perms
regarding my question on ordering the maps/gamemodes is there not a way to make it ordered on  some and not other gamemodes/types

also /stats isnt working for anyone except myself on my server only as of today
Check channel perms
those perms are for all channels that are related to the bot
also having a hard time with spectator roles
Its better to add rhe role you gave neatq
Make sure it doesnt override the neatqueue role perms
neatq and bot have the same perms and the bot has both of those roles
I dont really know whats causing it then, its gotta be some category, channel perms override, bc it works for me if its private and i just add the role
no the ordered gamemode selection would apply to all maps
ok i just seen it done before but i thought id ask if there was a way to program both
Nah ordered gamemode selection is either enabled or disabled, you can't customize it for specific maps
you could try using /votingmenu but that would require a bit of work
any commands that create anything or move people could cause that error?
it says manage perms
so check out everything ig
Hi, does the command **/map reshuffle** remove the previous map played in the latest queue ?
map reshuffle is just for the game
if its random then it will ask to reshuffle if u have it enabled
same
SO LIKE WTH
R u guys using custom json
nahh its not on them i cant imagine
hey NeatZ or Don could you help me with something. I'm trying to make a 4v4 queue for practices, how would I go about making the settings for that? I want full teams to be able to enter, I'm guessing that is with the party functions?
/queuetype
Full team vs full team
hi don, do you know if its possible to set up an autorole for if someone is in their placement matches? i want to set a multiplier for placement matches that are higher than the normal matches. my goal is that better players get further faster through that
you can add a `/autoroles games` for between 0 and 10 games, that should only apply for their placement matches
oh awesome! thank you so much neatz !
thank you!
Map selection is random but i didn‚Äôt get the command application
Wdym?
I dont understand what it does
did you turn on map reshuffle?
not yet
I have map selection on random
Its basically selects a random map and asks if you want to reshuffle to get another random map or still with that map, so it basically does that
That‚Äôs amazing! So it gives a vote menu such as captain voting ?
"Yes and No" voting menu
Yep, like captains reshuffle
Got it thanks üëçüèΩ
im using the bot for my streamers discord that im a mod in. he should be getting the premium soon once we get everything sorted. since ive set up neatqueue and he has to buy the premium itll count towards the bot in the server right?
premium is per server if that answers ur question
oh yes it does thank u so much !
Hi <@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>  i suppose voting is glitched, whenever someone picks yes it votes for no
Wdym?
Yes means to reshuffle
I see nothimg wrong
Whenever someone picks yes, it votes for no
Just now, it gave us unexpected error
The bot is having some issues rn <#919709100114346076>
People voted no although it chose them
Ah ok got it
it‚Äôs asking if you want to randomize
no means it won‚Äôt change the captains again
Thats how it works
Randomize captains?, thats the question
Ahh so its changed from the old system
yea the question is different now
probs confusing
Yeah last one was are captains valid
So yes would still, and no would randomize
But now changed <:PepeYesSign:1171266936651399279>
wont pick teams
+++++
Yea tbh
got a little issue and an eror code, anyone assist?
tried to select but interaction failed
canceled the game but now getting this haha
did you use /endqueue ?
as for the error, there are intermittent errors causing matches to fail
yea i used end queue, ahh fair mate, we just decided to mes about and play so not tested it again yet
you can always use /config list
which will show the most recently saved configs
configs are automatically saved when a queue is ended
Hey guys we've been having issues where players can't select a map in the map selection
What does it say
happens every once in a while but was wondering if its just a bug we & just have to keep cancelling the matches
it just doesn't let the captain select the map
there are 5 options plus the random button but they just stop working
The bot is having weird issues since today
Specially with match creation
So yeah
that's okay, I just wanted to make sure
we're getting this glitch right now
<@648635725964902411>
Did you change any perms?
But it can be the bot tho tbh
I think it is his discord settings but I was trying to see if you guys have seen that before
if i load a config during a game, will all get reset in the current match or will new config apply for next game
some admins of mine broke the configuration
Next game
Just in case this ever happens again, it was his settings with Text & Image. Once we changed it, it worked
yea i‚Äôm not sure if people disable that, or if somehow gets disabled automatically
page 1 on our leaderboard seems to be infinitely loading, other pages works fine. is it a common issue?
page 1 MMR to be specific
Its discord
You can click the name of the leadearboard and will redirect you to a leaderboard page
Website*
Last question I swear haha, when the captains were randomly selected it used to say "Are these captains okay" with yes or no, but now it says "Reshuffle captains" with yes or no. Is that something I can change?
Not really
If you mean changing it back to are the captains okay nope
If you mean change the text yea
no change the question it asks
idk how it changed
Bc it was an update
ohh gotcha
Altough if you put the old question the votes are gonna be wrong
it caught everyone off-guard. They were used to Are the Captains okay so everyones clicking yes automatically but its shuffling
Yeah happened to one guy too
it's all good tho, they'll get used to it
how do i delete a queue from the leaderboards?
Leadearboard comes with the queue
Each queue has its own one
i created a mock one just to figure out the bot and deleted that chat and queue should it still appear on leaderboards?
If you deleted the channel that doesnt delete the queue
You need to /endqueue first
okay thank you
Whenever you guys have an ETA on the bug with team selection, could you guys let me know. All of our servers are having major issues today
no ETA, it randomly started occurring
gonna spend some more time tonight looking at it
okay cool cool, thanks Neatz
does typing the numbers, like if they want to pick #4 player, type 4
does that still work?
our leaderboard is pulling pranks on us
coconutz should be closer to the bottom and i should be level with 1st
bot not giving and taking mmr correctly when teams win/lose
<@662891732102545453>
how can i buy neatqueue 250 queues for my server
I dont see nothing wrong
neatqueue.com, log in and go to dashboard
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> 

Wouldn‚Äôt move to picking stage
<#919709100114346076>
<:thisisfine:1128496721052307456>
Everyone is going to get errors when match is creating, theres a deep issue that randomly started happening
what server is it again
Working again ty
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> I need help, our queue isn't working
when players try to join its giving them cooldowns and autobans
It's actually down in every single one of my servers
https://gyazo.com/b9fca1c657c72cbe330bc5ad1cb1cbbf
Any changes you have made or it started randomly
/logs to see what commands have been used
nah nothing, and its across all of my servers
Can you end the queue and start it again to see if it works
i‚Äôm restarting the bot rn
yeah ive found that when matches get weird i just end queue and load the config it gives me
and its fine
The only thing with that is idk if it resets the leaderboard
Because we‚Äôre in a month long competition so I can‚Äôt risk that
nope it doesn‚Äôt
stats aren‚Äôt ever deleted unless you /manage stats
I accidentally deleted the stats somehow, it happened when I changed the name of the channel and the name of the queue
when you change the name of the queue its like deleting the stats
sorta yea
stats are tied to the name
but they aren‚Äôt deleted
if you put the name back then it gets back
Aw gotcha makes sense
There‚Äôs a command to merge them isn‚Äôt there? I think I remember reading one
yea /managestats merge
most the stat related stuff is in managestats
That‚Äôs what I thought, that‚Äôs good to know
For the queue btw, what‚Äôs the most amount of lobbies you guys have had at once? I just hit 20 without a hiccup but I was just wondering
it just stays ib this screen
even if you join the vc ?
Did you see that image?
It‚Äôs not giving or taking points from me I‚Äôm stuck at 1098 mmr it doesn‚Äôt change ever with a win or lose
I was below someone that was 4-0 when i was 5-0
And it is effecting others in the server but some people it work fine
What if you do /stats?
is entirley off
im not sure what has happen
it says i am 2-1 in stats but on our leaderboard im 5-1
yes...
it is now fixed but,

/captain selection is giving no options to choose from now.
wdym
Are you sure thats the leadearboard of that queue?
When using the /Captain selection command to ‚Äúchoose how captains will be picked‚Äù it does not show any options
Also using nicknames‚Äîi don't understand ‚Äú$‚Äù in your description of /ratinginnameformat
Because I queue and I do not see a nickname
$ Is the mmr
For example you can do `[$]`, that will be [1200] in name
You need to execute the command
Gosh haha!
Thank you
<@648635725964902411> some reason it won't give me mmr
It gives it to everyone BUT me lol
Bot cant edit server's owner nickname if you mean that
So everyone but me gets the edit ü§î
Got it üò≠
How do I stop it from asking if it's balanced or captains if I just want captains
`/teamselection set `
Okay lastly for the rating in name commands if I want to put ‚ÄúRank: $‚Äù how would I enter that in it doesn't seem to work how I'm trying üôÉ
Normally, `/ratinginname format format: Rank: $ location: Suffix`
Thank you! Ok I received this when queueing ‚Äî
oh you have captain selection with only 1 player
which kinda breaks cuz not enough captains
just use /test and join the queue a bunch
This happened after
I had to press no 3x to start the game
(big picture on left was sent on accident)
Wondering why it kept us from playing haha
Made us vote. But idk why?
And we had to press no for it to stop populating this over and over
are you talking about the ‚Äúrandomize captains‚Äù thing?
you can disable with /captains reshuffle
Dude this is so perfect
Thank you <@145305657237700608> your bot and team with Don and the others is amazing
Now if at all possible can the picture be made bigger on the right and also is there an option to say how many games out of the 5 games playable were won by each team?
we only have one leaderboard
does voting for the winning team timeout if people dont vote quick enough?
after an hour and a half by default
it will auto resolve
so either the team with the most votes, or a tie if the vote is tied
thanks! that picture is currently always the thumbnail, so it will always be that size
maybe should be the larger option
I may be misunderstanding, wdym>
Also is there a way to queue in more than 8 players and choose from the, say, 10 that are in the queue? Then the 2 not chosen would be sent back to the original location?
like i could change it to be a larger image
no that‚Äôs not a thing
Ok just making sure and yes! That would be great if the thumbnail was able to fill up more of the side area that is left blank!
i don‚Äôt think it can fill the side, it would take up a large section under the text
Is there any chance i could buy premium bot with paypal?
At least through the website nope
will it be added in future?
Dont really know, the payment is trough stripe, and idk if stripe has paypal
Hey im having an issue where players on the queue aren't able to match, presumably due to too high of and elo discrepancy between players, is there any way to change this or is it a different problem?
<@648635725964902411> do you know of any reason the bot would be down? Nobody can queue in my server
Hi <@857633321064595466> <@648635725964902411> does /leaderboardsharedstats command save multiple queue names or only one ?
im a part of a server where they use NeatQueue, but the join queue feature isnt working properly, is that an issue within Neatqueue or the discord server Im a part of?
Was wondering about scheduling messages. I set up 4 different ones (leaderboards) to send specifically to their queue at 08:00 CSt and they didn't send this morning
You can change the mmr range, i guess you have matchmaking queue, if you want to start a match no matter the mmr change the queue type to PUGs, `/queuetype`
No idea
If they have the same name you can save multiple ones i think so
im assuming youre talking abt zoomafia, idk what the problem is either
it seems like its just us tho
I see the error and its seems like is part abt the issues the bot is having these days
i am yes, was just trying to see if i could find anything to help
thank you
<@145305657237700608> seems to still be having issues in Zoomafia server
i believe zoomafia and BPL are hitting the maximum number of channels that a bot can create per day due to the high volume of games being played, figuring it out
Appreciate it.
Any idea why this didn't work??
‚ÄúWas wondering about scheduling messages. I set up 4 different ones (leaderboards) to send specifically to their queue at 08:00 CSt and they didn't send this morning‚Äù
Also my name is now an old name I had Clutch TTV on thenleaderbaord as opposed to the one it's been even on previous leaderboards which was just ‚ÄúClutch‚Äù
Used to just be ‚ÄúClutch‚Äù
hmm i saw it failed, didnt get to try out scheduling every command and guess that one didnt work
did you recently select ur username?
No I have had it forever
Any guess on how to fix it?
nothing changed in regards to that
You mean ‚ÄúClutch‚Äù
Idk what you mean
Before even on the leaderboard it would just say ‚ÄúClutch‚Äù
Not its changed here as well
same server?
ah you are right, looks like a version mismatch with a library im using
after changing the bot's host
Fixed it
Any updates with what's going on with ZooMafia? the mod that was updating server got off line
believe they are back
<@145305657237700608> I‚Äôm having the issue with players not being able to join the queue again
I‚Äôm worried about the dozens of random matches being created happening again
try ending the queue for a sec, it will destroy those matches
what‚Äôs your server ID, you might be at the channel limit as well
how many matches were played today?
only at 200 for the day
server ID - 1176236112646242404
To end the queue is it just /endqueue and then load config?
I just want to make sure that won't do anything the leaderboard
nope you will be good
try loading the config and seeing if people can start a match immediately maybe?
if not, then it is rate limited for creating channels
https://gyazo.com/f362a94a1560e2b379e10dfd9b6f6de9
yeah its not working still
hm ok i guess it didn‚Äôt interrupt the match setups
what‚Äôs the channel ID?
https://discord.com/channels/1176236112646242404/1176236113661280381
I can invite you to the server as well if you want
sure
yea ending queue doesn't cancel those setups nvm, hmmm
if you load that config in another channel, is it the same issue?
lemme try
Where can I find restrictions for non-premium mode?
Players were able to join in the queue in a new channel but once there was 8 it didn't make a channel for them
sounds like its rate limited on creating new channels then
is there any way to get around that
but yea you are only at 300 games
how did we get around that yesterday?
i think we just waited, im still poking around though
okay, will the issue of the backlogged matches popping up happen again
yes, thats part of what i want to prevent
I have it locked right now, but there was about 20 mins before that players were trying so there will be a decent amount of backlogged matches
If you could clear the backlog for me again Neatz I‚Äôm just going to keep it locked for another 30 mins and try again after
I want to open up my NA and EU one too but I know this will happen a lot there so I‚Äôm going to wait
yea im restarting + adding a prevention for this
k yea the backlog is cleared
<@298339106847457290> yea i see from new logs that it cant create the text channel for the match so its breaking
at least its not all piling up now but doesnt help you out much
curious, is that category filled?
It‚Äôll randomly start working and they‚Äôll be fine
And no the category is completely empty
like where the matches are created, right?
It goes to BPL Matches and that‚Äôs empty
then yea, it just cant create any more channels
did you have a ton of matches yesterday? it is a 24 hour cooldown
maybe you only went over the limit earlier?
We are averaging 500-600 a day right now
That's sick
When I open up NA and EU those will get around 1000 each a day
Only MENA and APAC are open publicly
yea‚Ä¶ zoomafia had about the same and hit the same issue
Yeah they‚Äôre the open NA call of duty one
i believe the channel limit is 2000 per 24 hours, which makes sense
600 matches would be over 2000 channels
ok, i have a ‚Äúfix‚Äù but it will still need to wait for that cooldown to expire
Anyway to make it where people that aren't mods/admins can see the lobbies running?
change the category perms and people will be able to see the voice channels
instead of deleting + creating new channels, it just moves them to a hidden category to reuse, which isnt perfect since it will clutter the sidebar for staff i think, but not sure what else to do
there is also a limit of reusing channels only once per 5 minutes, but that will probably be fine if it just reuses the oldest channel
I feel dumb asking but where do I find category perms on phone
Hold the category
Then scroll down a bit
Honestly that‚Äôs fine with me <@145305657237700608> . Everything is going to have trade offs, and I keep the discord pretty organized already. I‚Äôll test it in MENA, and if it works I‚Äôll open up NA/EU/Japan this week
alright, ive had it made for a few weeks now but never made it live
it would only kick into effect after about 1500 channels created in the day
That‚Äôs awesome
I can give you feedback on it too
Where's categories though?‚Ä¶ üôÉ
I've never used that lmao
The categories are the separations
I see create categories in the server setting
For example here one would be GENERAL
Like this
Got it got it
Ok and I went to (@everyo
Mb 
And put view channels permission as a check
Ok lemme see what u asked cuz im not following
I think I got it but here‚Äî
1st one by accident
(open 8s queue picture)
That should work
I essentially changed it where everyone can view channels now
Perfect
alright its enabled, lets see what happens
I've had a hard time understanding the MMR Decay. I'm trying to make it where If someone doesn't play for a certain period of time it goes down. I'm on a 50 scale(old school halo) and want a 1 drop every couple days. Either to everyone or to people that don't come often. Whatever you recommend?
so they drop by 1 MMR every 2 days?
decay only applies to players who don‚Äôt play a game
i just noticed my queues arent making limited vcs, theyre just making open vcs that people can join
how do i change this
Every few days yes. 2 MMR A week for a week of not playing and maybe 1 MMR in general per month if even an idea <@145305657237700608> .To incentivize more play in the server
Esp at such a tight MMR
did you change any permissions or settings recently
or add a spectator role
yea mmr decay is good for this
just set it to 2, it‚Äôs 1 week by default
I added it so the config list
So basically loaded it back up through a config
wdym
I didn‚Äôt change the spectator role at all
I made the config kept everything the same
This is only for people who DONT play right?
Ended the queue to get the config, and then loaded that config
<@145305657237700608> is there anyway for entire queue decay per month?
you can customize the duration
Also any update on the server scheduled commands? My leaderboard schedule didn't send this morning for any queues
no i‚Äôm focusing on other things rn sorry
So i can have multiple ‚ÄúHits‚Äù to MMR? To both players in and out of play? And I 100% understand. Thank you üëçüèº
check out what permissions is missing or now added
to figure out what is missing
no currently it‚Äôs only 1 setting which only effects inactive players
Thank you üôåüèº
So for Admin only commands how can I make it where it's also Mods?
For example /player sub
Or just that one command?
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/910981294937210930/1173718307438870661
how do i check?
cause my bot has admin privs
and i made it so there is no spectators
like check the channel
and see what is missing which lets everyone join
did you disable channel restrictions via /channel restrictions
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> queue keeps disappearing, how can it be solved
If you type when the queue isnt visible does it appear
<@648635725964902411> it‚Äôs all good now üëçüèΩ
guys how can i change the mmr of a player?
you can modify mmr with /set mmr or /add mmr
thanks <@145305657237700608>
<@145305657237700608> Why would when 2 random captains are selected and we vote to confirm captains its reversed, like when we all vote `no` it treats it as if we all voted `yes`
The question has been changed
yea for some reason i flipped the question without really meaning, my bad
so its fixed now ? I should expect things to work as expected ?
it‚Äôs not broken, it‚Äôs just not phrased the same as before
oh, ok I will pay attention to that
thanks for clearing
<@145305657237700608> that fix worked today in the MENA queue, was there anything on the backend that I should be worried about?
Thinking about opening up the EU queue publicly tomorrow
the channels being reused?
I‚Äôm not sure but this is popping up
I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs working as attended
yea you should see a new category with extra channels in it
which is hidden for everyone except admins
Yeah that‚Äôs perfect
you should be good to open up any queues yea
if you notice any weirdness with the reserved channels LMK üôÇ
That‚Äôs perfect, thank you for that
I will, so far so good
is there a way to make the VC's visible by all, but only allow participants to connect ?
Category settings
Or by /tempchannels perms
yea modifying the category perms for view channel is usually good enough
or you could try /voicechannels permissions
this is for the text channel üôÇ
i can never think of a good name for those commands, tempchannel is pretty vague
Misunderstood
Is there a way to change the name when a game is created? So the text channel will create #queue-x and I would like to create #xyz-abc
I have set my team names in this queue to be the captains names so it would reference them and set it as such
/tempchannels name
What a bloke you are
how can I make it so it displays 'Team 1' Vs Team 2?
Neatz is there any way to bring back the old leaderboard, idk what I did
in where
whats the difference?
you see weeman
the early match at 1463, then must of done something and the 2nd match hes back at 981
did u reset something?
do /logs
So when it creates the temporary chat channel, where the voting and reporting happens etc. In a perfect world I want it to say 'Team 1s Name' Vs 'Team 2s Name, so in the photo Easy Mac put in, Instead of sayikng Queue#89 it would say 'ItsKidzz Vs Rezzy'
i didn't do reset
thats not really possible
No problem, I appreciate the help regardless. Thankyou
no worries
I just wanted to make sure the leaderboard was in all-time and won't reset on Dec 1st
and now it reset lol
it reset to the starting mmr?
yeah
and I can't find the old MMR
i just tested it out, and if you put that command it resets the mmr lol
oh damn
that's good to know
i guess all the games and wins arent anymore
right
how do I make sure the leaderboards are in all-time and won't reset monthly
you can do like a rollback if you disable the monthly leadearboard c:
how do I do that?
by default it just doesnt reset
okay cool cool
just disable it `/leaderboardconfig monthly toggle:Disable`
and then I can rollback?
lmk if it works
when u disable it should get the mmr before enabling it
then do /stats weeman, to see if it worked out
yesss it did
thank you
perfect
thank you man
yea don soap was right, but when you enable monthly stats it treats it as a new month
so you should really only enable monthly stats at the beginning of the month
that's okay
if I enable monthly stats, can I still see all-time too?
yea the leaderboard will have options to view any month or alltime stats
cool cool
1 last question this might be dumb but I have queue sticky enable but its not going to the bottom
I personally recommend leadearboard on another channel, so it doesnt maybe bug sometimes
makes sense
But as i can see it doesnt go the bottom for me neither
i‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs a discord bug smh
the bot thinks the queue message is still at the bottom
i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs my own bad code though
it works perfectly in the MENA one, like 500 players a day use the my stats in that and it stays on the bottom
I don't need it in the pro one anyways so its no biggie
might just be unlucky
node 1 vs node 2
One thing I saw happen twice today is if 1 player doesn't join the other 7 get banned and lose MMR
i just watched it happen live once
let me restart node 2
it‚Äôs a similar issue with the queue message not sticking
sounds good, I'll let you know if I notice anything
should be good in a few mins
this weird things only happen when on the different host
nah it's all good
if people vote for the wrong team and the mmr is already rewarded is there a way to reverse that?
I‚Äôm stuck in a queue I can‚Äôt vote for and now I can‚Äôt play
yea /outcome
wdym stuck
Hi, I have a question about balance by roles with the bot (it is quite in-depth, I would assume, if yall would rather have a voice call, i can join any time if it is easier). 

I run a COD League server where we have 7 different player skill ranks, lowest being Emerald, and the highest being obsidian, that play 8s everyday. We went by balance roles so we did not have captains to pick teams, which is an attempt to avoid team stacking as much as possible (our lower ranks rarely play 8s due to this). For the most part the bot does balance correctly, however once there is an uneven amount of player ranks of the higher or lower rank, it gets a little messy. Hopefully there is a way to work on the logic with the bot through commands to fix the problems. Attach are 2 examples where it did not balance fairly.

Basically what we need the bot to do is if there is an obsidian and emerald player in the queue, we need these players to be paired up with each other, and the other 2 can be of the other rankings. 

Basically there should never be 2 obsidian or emeralds on the same team when there is only 2 players in the queue of that rank. If there is more then 2 players of those ranks, it needs to even out the teams, like in the SS attached.

Hopefully that made sense, and can be fixed with some logic tweaks with the balance rules or something else I could be missing. 

Appreciate your time in reading this!
is unranked the highest tier in your setup?
oh it‚Äôs the middle?
unranked is a wildcard, they could be really good or real "bad", we figured putting in the middle would be the fairest. it is new people to the server who have not went through the ranking process yet
do you know if there were any parties in these games?
Not sure what you mean, tbh, I would say no
everyone singly hit join queue
what‚Äôs your server id?
1069723212025450548
ok looking at the matches they seems to be pretty fair
for game 70, if you add up team 1s role orders its 14, and team 2s role orders is also 14
where emerald is 0, ruby is 1, ... obsidian is 6
is there a way to order the roles so it balances to the section "what the bot should have done". 

obsidians are miles better then emeralds

Queue 77 just filled and the teams are unbalanced in terms of skill level

Team 1: Kyanite, Amethyst, emerald, emerald
team 2: Obsidian, Amethyst, Ruby, Obsidian

What should have happened was each team should have had an obsidian and emerald, and filled the rest
something you can do right now is add dummy roles for padding the actual roles
Kyanite, Dummy Role 1, Dummy Role 2, Obsidian
this would give obsidian a higher value in terms of setting up teams
a better long-term solution would maybe allow for specifying some sort of "skill value" to associate with each role so the bot understands better the skill difference between roles
like Amethyst = 40, Kyanite = 50, Obsidian = 100, whatever
is the skill rating something I can do with commands currently in the bot? I will add the dummy roles for now
no that would be for me to do
the whole /balanceby roles thing was done quite a long time ago
understood, thank you for your help!
I am an admin in an 8s server that has a similar setup with the ranks asked above that was interested in using this bot. Do you have a time frame when this could be implemented, I am sure you a million projects going on, but figured I would ask, in case the owners of the server ask for this info.
yea no timeline, got other priorities + balancing by roles isnt a very common thing
totally understand, no worries
hi i have an 8s server and we voted but its still not popping upo the leaderboard
hi neatz and don. i set up an autorole for the role "placements" for the first 10 games a player plays so that i could make a unique multiplier for placement matches. when i first did it it worked fine, but now when a new player joins a queue the bot creates a new role everytime and assigns that instead https://i.imgur.com/5M0Dciy.png
there were about 5 of these roles that the bot created but i had tried the autoles reset command and redid the autorole and it still does this
wich commands did u use?
i used / autoroles games set
the exact command i used is "/ autoroles games set | role:@ placements | lower_value:0 | upper_value:10"
check your /info
Hi NeatZ and Don, I i have an 8s server and we voted but its still not popping up the leaderboard in my server, keeps saying i need to vote.
this is what it shows for that role https://i.imgur.com/E5QAfyb.png
seems it has to do with the queue thing ill just have to make a new role for that so it doesnt keep making a new one so its set on one role?
do /autoroles inqueue
oh awesome thank you guys it says thats disabled now <:Ok:1074079311784583291>
check again now?
Works now thanks!
How do you get the Waiting Room or Lobby VC to stay where its at, or have the voice channels created below it?
mine has the channels created above it.
how come sometimes i miss out on a que even tho i qued in 4th out of 8?
it fills to 9 and then leaves me out of the que
evenb tho que max is 8?
The question arose, is it possible to put a timeout on games with the same opponent in a 1-on-1 format?
It will create it below it by default, you can try to create the temp channels in another category if you want
What type of queue is it?
if thats what you mean
I meant like matchmaking or pugs
well cod private matches
if thats what you mean hahhaha im confused soz
The queue has a type
mm im not an admin
its just like anyone can que
and then captains get picked\
Are parties allowed?
all solo que
should i inv you to server
Take a ss of the queue
ahh yes it says matchmaking que
When its matchmaking its basically like searching people within a mmr range, so you probably didnt fit in the range
so like if low mmr que i cant join
i am #1 and a bit in front of #2
so i see
Basically their mmr were closer
i see thank you for your help
is there a way to disable the matchmaking from not trying to pair similar mmr
That would be changing the queue type to PUGs via /queuetype
thank you!
hey guys, our leaderboard doesn't work for some reason
the stats command gives correct info, it even shows the leaderboard placement individually
Probably a discord visual bug
To manually add points to someone's MMR I have to use /add mmr, but what's command for deducting MMR?
in the same channel? what if you click the leaderboard title URL?
you can just add a negative number
Thanks
yeah, same channel. this is the url https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/1057052494221561927/1173951345255010317
I don't see anything on the site either
Did the leaderboard glitch get fixed where i can display it every morning? Last time it didn‚Äôt work at all.
Not currently releasing any new changes until i figure some other stuff out, maybe tomorrow will be fixed
<@145305657237700608> I hope you get everything situated quickly and well.  Can the bot give someone a specific MMR based off of a given role in the channel? I wasn‚Äôt sure if you answered that as well
a starting MMR?
is there a way to individually test for the voting set up for team selection, and to determine if a queue set for BO3 randomizes three different maps which were added to a map selection?
<@145305657237700608>
you can test a queue with /test
i tried it
but did not allow to bring the voting menu
and then will get banned for 4 minutes due to not joining the temp channel
did you join the channel?
is there a method to change the voice channels the bot manually moves teams to? for example: instead of moving the teams to newly created temporary voice channels inside of where the neatqueue bot is being used, can it create two new channels in another category?
Do you mean changing where the temp channels are created?
hey guys I'm having an issue with the captains for this queue
I set it up as a random captain with an option to rerandomize but it didn‚Äôt do that
So I switched it to the two highest but it didn‚Äôt do that as well
Idk what I did wrong
the match was started after you modified the settings?
No it was before
It‚Äôs just putting them into a lobby and three matches in a row they had the same captains with no chance to redo
so the randomize captains thing only appears with Random Captains
Yeah I turned on the /captain reshuffle and that isn‚Äôt appearing
It‚Äôs just in that one queue too
This match was suppose to be highest mmr but it didn‚Äôt do that either
whats the queue channel id?
+ server id for that server?
One sec
https://discord.com/channels/1072934036089098370/1175966706003345549
unknown üò¶
Huh the ids aren‚Äôt there
ive got the channel Id not server though
nvm i found it
Ohh okay cool cool
I‚Äôm sure I just don‚Äôt have the right settings
says its set to Highest Rated currently
strange
Yeah, I just redid that again
try setting it to random again?
Yeah I‚Äôll try that
That should be good right?
channel with ID = 1175966706003345549 still says its Highest Rated
1072935551042326650 is random though
wait
looks good
Hi whats the command to prevent people voting whilst queued into a game?
i can't seem to find it :/
sorry my bad
not voting,
to prevent them from queuing up for a new game whilst currently in one
you can change the `/requeue condition`
thank you üôÇ
Yeah <@145305657237700608> it did random but didn‚Äôt give them a chance to reshuffle again
hmm yea i tried as well, the bot might be running an older version due to the issues
ill check it out after 4pm
wait
you have a captain role
seems like it just picks the first 2 players who have the role
that sounds like a flawed approach though
makes sense why the other modes werent working for you either
aw gotcha, I'll fix that
how long is the bot going down for a 4 pm btw?
hopefully 10 seconds lol
im gonna move node 2, then if all goes well node 1 a few minutes later
sounds good man
/channel category
how do i reopen a queue with an existing config code so it was the same as before
`/config load`
is there a way to only allow certain modes for individuals maps? ex: Hardpoint for map 1 & 2 and SND for Map 3 everytime?
yes `/gamemode selection gamemode_choice:Ordered`
then you can pick the order you want
after using that command it says application did not respond
do i type out the order in the command?
you should be able to just use the command <a:think360:393576508255371264>
odd, I'm using other commands freely
oh i see an error popping up
do you already have gamemodes configured?
whats ur config if you /config save
MUWPL
I just have maps listed vexause i was going to do only one mode
because*
yea doesnt work for me either
i guess cuz you have no gamemodes
you'll need to re-add each map with the specified gamemodes
so if i set the two seperate modes give it another go?
ok cool
will do
that worked thanks again homie
after we select team and the bot drags us to each channel, after about 5 seconds, it disbands all the VCs and disconnects all
you are probably in test mode still
<@145305657237700608> the issue with the buttons is back. When players are doing map picks or roster picks the buttons sometimes stop working
yea, seems there is still an issue, will  revert back to the old machine
test was disabled
maybe a requeue timer is too low?
cant find the command
Hello, can anyone help set up neat queue? I'm confused
Check the basic guide on channels description
You changed the match cleanup?
dont think so
Do /logs
I did and nothing worked
Whats the issue?
After starting queue says queue is started then nothing
No channel appears?
nope
sure was, thanks <@648635725964902411>
lemme know when you do that, just so i know
Hmm can you do /config save and send it
wdym send it
what name do I type after /config save
Just skip that
already done
says no queue found now
Did you end it
And make sure to do it on the queue's channel
I tried again after doing first step - got the noti saying channel has been created
then I tried doing next step /setup and says "Queue already exists in this channel!"
Hmm?
What commands did you use?
You did /startqueue and then /setup?
You can only use one to create a queue in a channel, no need to use both
okay
i used /startqueue
what do i do next
Then the queue is already created
You can now use it
To just use it by yourself to test do `/test`
how do i use it? no voice channel or anything is popping up
do you see any queue message in the channel
if not, make sure the bot has permissions to send messages
okay that worked how do we get around interaction failed
options to join queue have shown up now
If you click the join does it say failed?
now it is working
how do we set up leaderboards / mmr within cord
`/leaderboard`, if you want to use it in another channel do `/link`, and link the channel of the queue then do `/leadearboard` again
is there anyway to disable the bot asking if the randomized captains are fair after voting has concluded? and is there a way to make the temp VCs to be greater than 4 ppl>?
1. Disable `/captains reshuffle`
2. Team channels are gonna be the size of the team, you cant make it custom size, it will depend on the team size, the only thing you can do is adding a spectator role or disable the channel restrictions, this last one will make the vc unrestricted and then anyone could join
awesome, thanks
Is there a way to rename an existing queue?
`/queuename`, but when you change it you're not gonna have the stats in the new name
but you can do `/managestats move`
word doing it now
Whats the command to enable voting for balanced or captains?
`/teamselection set `
Do i do it twice for both captains and balanced? i did players choose and didnt realize what it meant lol
Do you want the voting menu for team selectiom to be Just Captains or balanced right?, so you run the command and select captains and balanced in the dropdown
players choose is another team selection method where each player clicks the team they wanna join
ohh i can do both gotcha
thanks yall
I put /endqueue in the queue#97 and it stopped my entire queue connected to it
How do I restart that queue
`/config load`
you probably wanted `/cancel`
Tried it can‚Äôt find the old one üò¢
`/config list`
It gave me a queue
im getting random neatqueue channels and channel pool any fix for that
Wdym?
the bot is creating its own category and its calling channels neatqueue reserved channel
Its your server really big?
just over 1k
If you have too many games
The bot will get limited by discord, so the solution for this, was to re use channel and categories
Probably thats your case
yea, how many games played in the last 24 hours
Hello, I just wanted to ask whether there is any way to create a relegation system between queues, so that if one performs poorly in one queue, they get demoted to a lower queue?
Check out /autoroles and /role requirement
thanks ill have a look
`/gamemode selection` occasionally returns "The application did not respond" when i attempt to use it. any fix?
are you trying "Ordered" ?
^ maybe this same issue?
99% sure i put gamemodes in but i'll double check
well i said that but i dont know how to double check short of removing and re-adding every map
`/info` its on one of the pages
word
Yep, looks like one map didnt have a mode tied to it. Works now. Thanks!
yea ill fix that when im able to actually make updates again üòì
Alot of games cant really count them, not sure how to check it either
Is there a way to change the temporary VC names like there is for the text channels? Specifically just different names for the different queues
/serverstats info, altough it resets in 5 mins
Yep, `/teamnames set`
If you mean the vc  queue # channel, nope
Teamnames set will change the actual name of the teams though right, like it replaces team 1 team 2
I'll test that, thanks!
Neatz any luck on leaderboards? Also for streaks how does that work? I implemented it and not sure what im looking for or when, or if i can adjust when they start.
Scheduling auto commands, in my case leaderboards in the am at 8cst
havent had the chance to look at it, just got other things that have higher prio
you can just click the refresh button for now?
Will do thought I‚Äôd ask
Hey, anyone have a good way of automatically updating roles based on activity levels?

For example, our server wants a user to play at least 6 games per month to be considered "active". At the beginning of each month, players who played at least 6 games in the previous month get to keep their colored rank role that puts them high on the sidebar. 

If they played under 6 games, their active role is removed until they play 6 games in this month, at which point their active role gets reinstated. But the "inactive" player is still eligible to queue in all the queues they could before even while they are "inactive".
the only way i can think of doing it currently is with `/leaderboardconfig monthly`, then setting up some `/autoroles games`
that way its fresh stats each month
taking a look now, what did you try that broke?
oh nvm i see
Problem is that'd remove everybody's roles, even the ones who played 6 games the previous month, right? And we need stats to not be reset.

My attempted solution was to use the "points" system (e.g. 1 game played = +1 point), and do some form of resetting everyone's points every month.

But I tentatively concluded that we need a way of setting someone's points to 0 or 6, nothing in between. We can start by e.g. /points ceiling 6, then we could do something like points = (int)points/6 * 6 with integer division which would yield 0 or 6 only. Don't know if that's possible though
how would you determine who to give 6 points vs 0
If you played at least 6 games in the previous month, you get 6 points, else you get 0
also my little equation is wrong but it can be modified to produce the right result (multiply by 6 again [nvm fixed])
so if people have 6 games, they would already have the active role right?
yeah, like the autorole would require 6 points
right
so you want to reset everyone with < 6 points  back down to 0
you can do `/autoroles points set role:Inactive lower_value:0 upper_value:6`
and /autorole points set, minimum 6. for each rank role
then `/set points points:0 role:Inactive` at the beginning of the month
so anyone with 0 - 5 points gets the Inactive role, which gets the points reset to 0
oh i see
ok thank you very much, going to mess around with this
np, good luck
how do I get this to pop up in other queues? Right now I can't get it even though the /captains reshuffle is enabled
do you have `/captains selection` set to Random?
or at least Random is pickable
yeah its set to random
oh you might have a captains role still?
idk its weird, in some queues that pops up, but in others it won't
i don't think I have a captain role, but is there a way to delete that?
just `/captains role`
if u give me the channel ID i can check
I guess i'll give you two
https://discord.com/channels/1072934036089098370/1072935551042326650
https://discord.com/channels/1176236112646242404/1178464709649895484
idk what the difference is between these
https://discord.com/channels/1072934036089098370/1175966706003345549
both have a captain role
i think there is an issue with loading configs where it creates a role for certain settings
even if its not supposed to
well, i know its a bug, i have a fix for next update
i suspect thats why its confusing cuz u probably didnt add it
yeah, like in the BPL mw3 they love the reshuffle ability
but i can't seem to find a way to add it to the old man one which reallllllly needs it
yea do this
I tried doing highest rated, voting, random, none of it worked
ill verify after
I tried that earlier and it didn't change
try again real quick üòõ
i added it but no one is playing in that one until tmr
so ill let you know
if you dont have stats you can run a test
then delete your own stats
ohhh gotcha ill do that
which channel did you update?
goat
the old man one
it just worked
ah ok
i expect if you look at the server roles you will see a "new role" role
which was accidentally created upon loading a config
gotchaa
its funny learning the deep settings on the bot
theres quite a bit...
I‚Äôll check it soon neat. Also I have two lobbies and open ranked and a champion rank lobby. When an individual goes from one to the other it resets and won‚Äôt set back when he goes to the other queue he says it‚Äôs fixed now üôÉ
what resets
any possible way to show who has queue'd up?
do you have it hidden?
would it be the hide stats command?
you probably have `/anonymousqueue` enabled
which is enabled by default in the Matchmaking queue type
thanks papi
Hey <@145305657237700608> im having some very weird issues where the VC are being deleted mid-match
just the VC or the entire game
so mid-game there is 2 VCs, 1 per team right, but 1 is getting deleted
happened to like 10 matches at the same time about 10 mins ago
did people leave the VC?
like was it empty
nah mid-match
audit log says it was neatqueue right?
I'll look
you see how only 1 VC is here
yeah its stilll doing it now too
audit log confirms?
its not showing anything
when a channel is deleted it has to show in the audit log somewhere
nono, the discord server's audit log
its just a lot of this
you should be able to find if it deleted any channel
i wonder if its incorrectly reusing channels
we're super busy right now so that could be it
we have like 35 concurrent lobbies right now
somewhere in the audit log it would mention that channel name
itll be hard to figure out whats going on otherwise
I made it so each queue has its own category for matches, instead of one category for matches, could that be an issue?
if this only started happening after that, then perhaps
ill look into it more, might wanna change it back for now and see
Yeah it did
I'm gonna change it back
like you did `/channel category: New`? just to verify
No so I have 7 queues going right now:

Premier
Advanced
Open
and 4 variations of SND

So I used to have 1 big category, but the premier players asked if they could have their own. So I made 4 categories of Premier, Advanced, Open, and SND Matches. The Open one has 29 matches rn so it auto does the 2 categories because only 20 fit into 1
and I think that's the issue
oh oh
i mean that should be fine, thats how alot of servers do it
Idk that's exactly when the issue started
so now I'm going back to just one category (Live Matches) and I'll see if that fixes it
I think its only an issue because the Open one forces discord to make a clone category because it goes over the limit.
thats not actually a discord thing, thats a bot thing
discord just sends an error if you try to put too many channels in a category
gotcha
when it creates a channel it marks it as used, then when the match ends it marks it as unused
so im not sure what could be interferring, i cant replicate it
how possible create ‚Å†a channel like this <#915813502558556181>
`/staffchannel`
is it possible to pull all players from the temp (unrestricted) VCs aka Team 1 & Team 2, and others who join the channel and NOT return them to previous channel but to a fixed VC already established by the server?
also is it possible to have the captains select the winner of the match?
btw its been fine now that I put it back to 1 large category
so idk, maybe I just did it wrong
Hey, quick question. How do  I remove that people recieve a PM when a queue gets created.
how do i change the vc time limit when it is in queue
Whats a pm?
i think you can bcuz in another server it shows 1.5mins
Oh time
I missread
for me 5mins
I thought u said size limit nvm
Then do `/lobbychannel timer`
bet ty
`/matchstart dmplayers`
hmm ill try checking it out more today, i know other servers do the separate category thing, it really shouldnt break anything
is this possible? just wondering bc ppl like to join and watch and then it kicks them out of the match created channels
Like return all the players to a specific VC when the match ends?
Quick question, when using /leaderboardconfig sharedstats, does it auto configure stats if leaderboard is set to monthly reset ?  Or do we need to re-enter the command ?
and everyone else who joined the channel
Have u tried the /lobbychannel
yes, just doesn't give me an option to set where to returnall. only gives me the option toggle enable/disable
It will return to the lobby channel u set
nope it should automatically work
how do I avoid this?
You cant, if someone is currently in a game setting up teams they can't join queue
at least currently no config for that
yeah nvm I got it
I was in test mode in another channel
tyty Neatz
Hey, this just happened, how is it possible? The mmr gained/loss should be around 25 https://i.imgur.com/gVdIPVP.png
I also tried to cancel and reassign the win, and it went even worse, they got something like 10000 points lol
Hmm thats crazy
is this a new queue config?
or just randomly occured
The only thing I changed last night was the autoroles
Cause I removed the rank E which was below that, and then I set that they shouldn't drop their rank if they fell below 1000 instead of 1200
but I don't get how that should be related tbh
yea it likely isnt
whats the channel ID?
1090225942762373150
Hi, I‚Äôm pretty new on discord and I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to play sub 8‚Äôs with the zoomafia, I‚Äôm on mobile, any help would be appreciated üòÇ
https://discord.gg/zoomafia
Join here, then go to this channel
https://discord.com/channels/754130819634692106/1123240713526710384
is anyone able to help me with basic setup
\/setup doesn't work for me
this message comes up and then nothing
make sure to give the bot permissions to send messages
got it
if I want to create a game
and input a match result
for the MMR bot
how do I do that?
<@145305657237700608>
like I want to record the result of a game
Thats by default
When you select winners
wait
so I have a game that wasn't created through the bot
is there any way to add this info in?
Wdym?
You can manually add mmr by `/add mmr`, but you cant create a winner results w/o playing a game
okay
if everyone has an MMR
does the bot create the teams for us?
Everyone has an starting mmr that is 1000 by default
The bot will create the teams yea
is there any way to adjust these teams?
You have some modes yeah
Balanced, random, unfair, captains
any idea on this tho?
has it happened again?
i'll let you know if it happens again then
but i mean, it kept happening when managing the game from the mod view
yea unfortunately i cant see much in terms of the elo calc since it has been reverted
is there a way for people to join the queue simply by joining a specific voice channel or does everyone who wants to join physically have to click the join queue button
yes everyone needs to click the button
at least you use /startfromvc every match manually
i think that hybrid2 draft style is broken.  isnt it supposed to be 1-2-1-1?  it goes 1-1-1-1 right now
It works for me, are u sure youre using it?
You can check with /info
i am
so team 1 should get first pick, team 2 gets 2 picks, and then they go 1-1-1
right?
yeah, team 1 is getting one pick, then team 2 is only getting one pick
then back to team 1
is there a command to end a game without the stats counting?
/outcome cancel
Or /cancel
It works fine for me, could you send me your queue config?
how do i do that?  /save config and send u the code?
NYFNJ
just tested again.  still not working correctly
i cant find a comman which disable DM notification about match starting, anyone can help?
yep /matchstart players
Hey <@145305657237700608> the VC deletions are happening again. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre getting deleted, I think they‚Äôre getting repurposed mid-match
For context we have around 30-35 concurrent matches rn
zoomafia reported the same thing, i also agree this is likely an issue with the channel pool
8s are just too popping right now üòÇ
apparently
is it happening like 10 minutes after a match starts again?
friday nights man
<@298339106847457290> i disabled voice channels temporarily to combat it, which is very ass but it keeps us alive for the night
then using Mee6 to create temporary channels which players can join
That‚Äôs good to know, I‚Äôve just been make extra VCs in the bottom for now
once things slow down you should be good to re-enable, also overnight the bot should clean up the channel pool channels
but i will investigate this heavily tomorrow, top priority
<:o7:1147222271241506906>
Error code: ZVYUJ help
Just happened again in another rank. Apparently players who get all these points are players who dont appear in leaderboards before their game
1072487675774390272 here's the channel Id for the mod view, the problem here is some players get double points (+60 in some cases)
1064545396606644255 and here's the ID of the queue
It's weird because people with 3600mmr are getting 50 points for a win against 3000mmr players, while the usual mmr gain should be around 25
Have u used hybrid 2 before?,
Ok you can fix it by /captain firstpick and setting it to lowest rated
im pretty sure i tested that.  because the lowest rated captain should have picks 2, 4 & 5
i really don't get it, there are certain players who are not appearing in the leaderboards even after they played 1 game, so it's not even the leaderboardconfig requiredgames problem
and these players who don't appear are the players who get the doubled points or get the 8000 points in lower ranks
It worked for me with your config
what‚Äôs ur config code?
the issue wouldnt have to do with the captain's MMR would it?  idk what is causing it to tweak.  team size being 4?
I dont know tbh, your first captain pick is like always team 2
hmm that might not work yea
HXQAB, but it's just one of many channels for the same queue
it might assume it‚Äôs team 1
let me check it out
thanks
When i set his config to random and highest it starts with team 2 and go straight
Weird
yeah when i set it to lowest MMR it doesnt work as described.  which unfortunately in my use case it's resulting in some unfair teams.
because lowest MMR *should* have first pick and then 3rd and 4th picks.  but it just goes back and forth instead of getting 2 after the first 2 picks
like the straight drafttype
yea i think the logic probably assumes that each draft type starts with team 1
that would be a bug
is there a way to automatically assign the lower MMR captain to team 1? or would that be a backend fix
i believe that‚Äôs the default no?
also if you have an example of a player in this state, lmk
Players earning strange amount of MMR
now that im looking it appears that it is.
no idea then why the picks are going 1-1-1-1-1-1 when using hybrid2 drafttype üò¶
Hey guys idk if the matches played reset today, it was suppose to three hours ago
its locking my queue, I thought it reset at noon
I also can't sign in on my dashboard to upgrade it
<@145305657237700608>
<@648635725964902411>
It shouldve reset
nah none of my servers did
Also seems like theres a bug signing ye
yeah
my EU one is stuck right now
is there any way I can fix this, the same issue is about to happen in my NA and MENA servers
Theres nothing actually
just have to wait?
how can i
make it so
so the people who q goalie have 1st pick automically
let me manually reset all
i‚Äôm out right now and can‚Äôt manually reset
should be able to log in now i think
i‚Äôll refund any temp upgrades
Okay I‚Äôll do that
is there a way to use the hybrid drafttype without the MMR requirement?
If I want to make it so people who are queues as goalies become auto captain how could I do that
hmm i think you really cant
wdym?
it doesn‚Äôt have any mmr requirement
is there a way to have 3 different leaderboards for 3 different "elos"?
I haven't looked into NeatQueue yet so I'mma ask first before configuring stuff
yea, each queue can have its own stats, or you can link them all together
Are tournament random seeded
seeding is based on MMR
it says ‚Äúpick a player under xxxx MMR to get another pick‚Äù
oh that special hybrid type
yea thats MMR dependent
does the leaderboard work before people have played a match?
I'm trying to give different players different initial mmr
is this possible or nah
Hey guys, having a little issue with our queue. When people are the first /8 in queue it doesn‚Äôt start and others are able to join the queue. Sometimes the first people to queue are missing out. Anyone have a remedy for this?
They have to play 1 match to appear
Yes you can, you can set initial mmr roles, and just give it to them
/startingmmr set
Seems like you are using matchmaking queue?
U might want PUGs, do /queuetype ans change it
In a queue where teams join, if two teams of 4 join will the queue skip the team drafting step?
Is there a way to change the rank output? Or could I connect a jpeg/png picture that is connected to a rank when they earn it? For example rank 1 has a picture of a 1 next to their name instead of the text
Like in original Halos
no that‚Äôs a nitro feature i believe
okay cool cool, I'm trying to make practice queue but I haven't done that one before
gl lmk if you have questions
Easy and Neat I‚Äôm guessing that 4v4 can be used for scrims specifically as well
Any tips on that? I‚Äôm trying to make a scrims channel as well with the maps preset
There‚Äôs no way to tell who won what maps in the queue right? It‚Äôs just series wins only?
yes just series wins for now still
for 4v4 scrims you would use `/queuetype` Full Team vs Full Team (or Select team on join)
Is there anyway or any command that lets you document who you won against and maybe export it?
Hmm no
are you trying to see like matchup stats?
how many times you've beat someone
When you load a configuration from another queue (most updated queue) but don‚Äôt have connected stats, on both those queues. Would me loading that take away all the stats from the queue that I‚Äôm loading the config into?
Basically queue 1 is adjusted with commands everyday but isn‚Äôt connected to queue 2 they each have their own stats. Would me loading queue 1s config to 2s erase or displace queue 2s stats?
Stats wont delete if you dont use /managestats reset
You can load it, but youll need to change the name of the queue to the one you had
Then I do that command?
/ms reset
Do you want to delete every stat?
No I want to maintain the stats in the queue
Then dont do that as i said
Stats wont delete unless you use that command
Ok so the load config ONLY changes the configuration of the Queue itself
Not stats
What im saying is if you load it, stats wont delete
Even if it‚Äôs from another queues configuration
Well basically you are loading a code from one queue to another channel
Now that will have the stats of the queue code you loaded
Ohh crap so it‚Äôll load queue 1s stats into it
Into queue 2
btw this is possible to see via the API, matchup stats are tracked, just not shown in any discord command atm
You can jst rename it
That‚Äôll be nice when y‚Äôall make the command! If that‚Äôs in the works haha
check out <#910981294937210930> which explains how stats are linked to queues
Right I‚Äôll change the name of course just wondering stats
In this situation
Ok so lemme explain better
Queue 1 -> Config save
Queue 2 -> Stats are Linked to its name
You load Queue code -> you have queue 1 config, stats and name
You want queue 2 stats back but with queue 1 config -> now change the name of the Queue you loaded -> Queue 2 stats back with queue 1 config
Badass man thank you
<:pepeOk:1179576926613020772> <a:4282_congapartyparrot:1140195503921963078> <:5492_EzPepe:1140195541716828224>
<@298339106847457290> Did you see this
Hey folks,
I‚Äôve got our bot working mostly fine and it‚Äôs awesome, however after a game finishes when the queue fills again it doesn‚Äôt start again‚Ä¶ sometimes it will get hung for 5 minutes. 

Is there some setting I‚Äôm missing that sets a time for this? I checked the documentation and didn‚Äôt see anything that jumped out. 

Thanks in advance!
Do you have the queuetype in matchmaking?
Err‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm unsure what you mean, so I‚Äôm guessing no?
If your queue has matchmaking name in it, and u didnt add that it means is matchmaking
-> **Matchmaking:**
Players join the queue, and once there are enough players within their MMR range, a match is created.
you might want PUGs, so do `/queuetype` and change it to PUGs Individual
I‚Äôll try that, thanks. This is for CoD 8s, so we just want it to trigger when 8 are in the queue regardless of MMR.
aw damn that'd be sick
I also don‚Äôt know what a PUG is
Pick up game?
It just means that if is 4v4, when theres 8 players, no matter their mmr the game will automatically start
That‚Äôs perfect. Thanks so much for your help.
idk a good way to show that info
maybe a new section in /stats
idk what though
maybe something like /player stats and show it there
could show it in /compare
just the head to head stats
not sure
but a way to view like top 10 best teammates + top 10 best enemies
What about ‚Äò/versus playername‚Äô
For the head to head
thats what /compare would show i think
basically the same command
that's cool tho, I can still use that
have you guys found anything on the VC issue? Its been popping up pretty consistently the past 2 days
has it happened within the past 3 hours
It happened in one of our series in the past hour, but it must not be often because nobody has complained since Friday night
where the VC is reused on accident, right?
I believe so yes
<@298339106847457290> what about you?
yeah its been happening a lot
within the past 3 hours?
yeah within the past 15 mins
I have just made 20 VCs below so when it happens I just point them there
hmm alright, yea im not too sure why its happening, i thought it mightve been fixed as of today's update
ill try reproducing it more
It‚Äôs actually doing it right now I believe, people are saying they can‚Äôt vote because the text chats are disappearing
havent been able to
yeah that's been a small thing, sometimes it gets stuck at 4 votes and I have to /outcome winner it
so its text channels too?
I‚Äôm not at my setup I can‚Äôt verify but that sounds exactly like what the VCs were doing
yea it does
the text channels haven't disappeared (besides 1 time) its just the VCs mid-match
but sometimes the text channels don't allow users to vote the winners
what happens then
At that point I get 7 dms asking why they can‚Äôt queue again then I manually do it
lol i meant more like why doesnt it let them vote
does it say anything
when the channel still exists
Sometimes the channel stays open but the vote dialogue isn‚Äôt there, sometimes it is there and just won‚Äôt update to the next vote, and then what I said before sometimes it removes the entire text channel
But I haven‚Äôt seen anything about an error message or anything like that no
my suspicion is that if the vote message deletes but not the channel, is cuz that channel is rate limited from being deleted
so it would just kinda sit there
yeah the vote just sits at 4 and then i have to /outcome winner it
usually I get pinged about once every couple of hours about it
that one isn't as bad as the VC one
if only discord didn't cap the bots man
are they blocked from requeuing?
im not sure actually
i usaully get it pretty quickly
curious, what is your match cleanup timer set to?
I have some new thoughts on what could be causing this
i haven't touched that setting
its still happening too,  usually happens more when its super busy
thats why its so hard for me to debug lol, i cant get it to happen
you want to join one of our servers?
you can prob see it happen within 15-30 mins
sure
im actually gonna push an update which will add special audit log messages for when the channel is moved
https://discord.gg/4nzJbPsj
should at least give some context into what triggers it
that'd be cool
idk why but for NA i can see the reserved pool of text/voice channels, but in the mena i cant
those are other servers right
https://discord.gg/SPjBHXND
yeah so in this one they are hidden somehow
these are the two servers the VC deletion happens in
MENA has 1470 channels in the past 24 hours, so it wont be using the channel pool for now
yeah that one is usually on the edge
NA hits it at night
ok update is live, so next time it happens we can see the reason
ok update is live, so next time it
Is there a way I can remove someone's IGN entry and make them re do it
yea `/set ign`
Do I need to do account:'none'
Or account:none
?
just type none
no quotes
And will that make them re enter their IGN before being able to join queue, I have it current set that people need to have set their ign to join it
yes exactly
Thanks for the help üôÇ
at least it should lol
how do u add it so if people get a certain mmr
their mmr gain is lower than the others.
say 500 is 20
to make 700 15-10
it will automatically adjust MMR gains depending on the MMR of the other team
you can adjust with /mmr change variance
for how it varies
how do i set maps, then modes so that you have to choose map and then mode for each? like a cod map and then a game mode
<@145305657237700608>
it‚Äôs game mode then map
but when you add a map, you can specify the gamemode
in the command /map add
so i add the mode? like hardpoint
because i do / map add and do the map but then i do not have a choice for the mode
it‚Äôs an optional argument
i saw nadeshot and them have it where they select a map and then the mode for that map
got it, understand what you were saying now. thank you
sorry for spam , how do you make so it autobalances teams and not use the captain format?
change your /teamselection
how do you make it so mmr = a certain role
im v new to discord
management
`/autoroles`
So also accidently used @ everyone on one of the mmr roles and need to take that away what do I do
I did this last week but double checked and did it again last night, but still having the same issues
What's better having MMR change by team or by player when it comes to 4v4 games like halo?
Also anyone know why it ends the que so fast if someone isn't in voice chat. It says 5 minutes but then will just close down the lobby at 5 seconds and say the player is inactive and one more that Everytime a lobby is over it goes back to a specific channel can I change the channel it brings them to
Share ur config code
Same thing happens when doing the queue in here on test mode. Is it just a test mode problem?
Think one of the boys picked it up, some reason switched back from PUG. Switched it back this afternoon and seems to be running okay
You change the channel it brings them to via /lobbychannel
Also can you share your config code too see why it ends quickly?
Even in the que in this server it ends quickly
Not sure if it's just a test thing
Wdym?
If you go to normal que and it's in test mode
And put yourself in all slots
It will close out of the lobby within 5-10 seconds instead of doing the normal timer
Test mode reduces timers
Ahh so if you don't join the queue right away it closes it. Just wanted to make sure that was what was happening before I go live with my server lol
And the lobby channel just brings them back to a voice channel I thought. Not a text channel
You cant bring them back to a text channel that you set
Is there a discord setting that I can change just seems annoying Everytime they get out of que having to go back to the welcome channel
I dont think so
i wish
is there a way to turn off the voting for new captains ? I want it to force the first 2 captains the bot picks
the "Randomize Captains" vote?
or just the vote for how to pick captains
yea the Randomize Captains vote
`/captains reshuffle`
awesome, and `Balanced` selection will try to pick the 2 top MMR players to be captains is that how I understand it ?
no it will pick two players with close MMR
for top 2 players, pick Highest Rated
thanks
hey how can i setup bot so he will show roles in que ?
You cant in matchmaking queue (roles)
show names?
you can disable /anonymousqueue if thats what you mean
how do i set up an automatic voice channel that pulls players for each team?
team voice channels?
Can anyone explain to me how to configure the bot, to add Join queue and drop rank
Rank system
neatqueue basic guide can give you an idea of the rank system :] https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
And obv how to create a q
I have a group on WhatsApp with 30 friends and we play fwd Assault. However, we want to implement the bot to generate matches and create an automatic rank through discord. Can someone help me?
Thanks bro, I'll look here!
If you struggle with something then you can ask it here
Ok Bro
<@648635725964902411> Sorry to bother you again, I read the guide, added what to my server but I can't start the matchmaking configuration
<@648635725964902411>
<@893829036747411487> when u do /setup does a command above the textbox appears?
It doesn't appear, I type /setup but nothing appears
If you type the /
Command appears?
Oh now it works
Aight
Now I will try to configure
Is there a way to reduce the amount of votes needed for win voting
And is there a way to reduce amount of time for vote duration
/requiredvotes winner
/timer votes
Is there some sort of bug where the bot drags people to the "Queue" voice channel that it makes, but doesn't drag players to their "Team" voice channels? If there was an announcement about it I didn't see.
still having an issue with captains first pick
and adds about 40s delay for teams to get dragged to the vc channel
captains pick goes to other team and vise versa
could you elaborate
Idk if you're talking to me or the other guy but i'll explain my issue. I have a "Chill" lobby voice channel which I set as my lobby with the bot. When I start a matchmaking lobby with teams, it drags all the players voice the "Chill" voice channel into the "Queue" voice channel that it makes. The bot makes "Team" voice channels as well, but it does not drag people into their teams like it used to from the "Queue" VC. Is there a timer on there now or some sort of bug, because I'm using the same preset I've used before and it doesn't work anymore.
Whenever I use those commands they say that they worked but whenever I go to the vote it‚Äôs still 60 secs
And still requires the normal amount of votes
there‚Äôs no timer for voting for the winner though?
must be some sort of bug then
Gotcha
once you queued enough players, the vc waits about 30s to pull everyone, instead of immidiately. 
once captains are picked, and the first pick goes to captain 'x' captain, but once he picks his first player, it pulls him into the wrong team. ('y' captain). the selection of teams goes to the wrong captain.
what‚Äôs your config where that is happening?
D3MDG 8s
or XVVHE if that doesnt work
Ya there‚Äôs no timer for winner I‚Äôm talking about the setup of the match like picking captains and how captains are determined
what are you trying to change?
I want the timer for selecting captains to be less than the normal 60 secs
And I‚Äôm changing the amount of votes needed to win a vote but it‚Äôs not actually changing
`/timer votes`
check out `/requiredvotes`
but there is no override for captain selection only
Yup I used both those commands
And they didn‚Äôt change anything
Still 60 secs for the vote to finish if everyone doesn‚Äôt vote
And still makes majority people vote even tho I set votes required to 1
whats ur config code
just gave it a test and it seemed to work
oh nvm i see, its displaying the wrong name
in the bottom
yeah it happens 2 out of 3 times and it lets the wrong person pick as well
yea i see the issue, quick fix
its only an issue with the random first pick mode
so i would swap for now
copy
How do I see that
Also when I do /info it says menu timer has changed but when a match starts the captain voting timer is still 60 seconds
`/config save`
KHKSC
that config is giving me 10 seconds to select
ok its fixed
<@145305657237700608> good morning
I‚Äôve had a few small issues when setting one the queues up
How do I change it to captains random and the people to vote yes or no ?
I‚Äôve tried but keeps popping up the voting system
/captains selection set to random
/captains reshuffle set to enable
üôèüèº thank you
<@788439042873622530> Any way to reset the leaderboard to zero?
/managestats reset all will reset mmr and leaderboard
üôèüèº thank you
If i want to change the mmr for wins and losses how do i do it please?
example: 30 win and 10 loss
Thank you
Can you explain mmr Variance? Especially with up to 50 MMR only in a discord
Also I saw your mmr reset all. But is there a way for people to maintain their wins and losses after? I added roles to everyone to determine mmr at the reset but i don‚Äôt want to lose the game stats as well
i'm not a mod or on support i just have been experimenting a lot with the bot. in plain man's terms, the higher you set the variance value the lower the varying amount of outputted mmr will be. so lower variance will have higher swings in mmr and higher variance will have lower swings.
although if i'm wrong i would like an admin to correct me
<@788439042873622530> thank you. I‚Äôm wondering since I‚Äôm only going to 50 what should I use
Default one is balanced enough
that depends, do you want them to always gain 50? if so use /mmr change set and enable static
how do i change this to be always the same?
`/captains drafttype`
got you thanks
i have done 3 type of queues in diferent channels but i cant load one the leaderboards
ive got one queue for HP only, SnD only and TEAM vs TEAM
HP all ok, SnD not loading the leaderboard
You need to link up the channel
Got you, any chance to input the names of the teams?
When entering the queue or?
You can change team names
`/teamnames set`
But it will be constant not variable for user input
But you can also set the teamname to be captains
`/teamnames captains`
ok, maybe would be a good option for the feature for scrims etc
<@648635725964902411> the leaderboard for the teams seems to be showing individual mmr's instead of the team
Can this be changed? or the leaderboard is only able to show individual mmr?
i think is just individual stats
yup, team stats are not tracked
looking to set up role exclusive mmr gain and mmr loss across a variety of roles, though we have a couple of issues

- `/mmr change set [amount] (loser_mmr) (static)` adjusts mmr loss, though the lack of a role argument doesn't seem fitting for role exclusive mmr loss.
- Decay works in the same fashion as the above issue; we'd like to adjust decay to be active past a certain mmr threshold, 
- `/mmr multiplier set [role] [multiplier]` works fantastically for role exclusive mmr gain; however it doesn't seem to work both ways according to the description.

thought I'd ask in support before making a feature request in case anyone has solutions
an explanation for these limitations will also suffice; understand that while this is an excellent general matchmaking solution it is also not a be all do all solution
you dont really need to set mmr changes per role
im not sure what you are trying to it
to reiterate I'm experimenting with dynamic mmr gain and loss as players gain and lose mmr
I did some snooping and I might experiment with the changes added here https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/910981294937210930/1180776067158511706
to try to implement that idea with multiple role exclusive queues
but maybe I'm overthinking the solution?
are you doing 1 queue per role?
that's what I plan on doing for that idea yeah
it's not optimal
each queue can have different settings
like different MMR changes
mhm yeah that's what I interpreted from those changes
and as long as they have the same name then the stats can transfer
as long as the setting is enabled
its not a new change at all
that change is just a way to easily link all queues with a single command
link meaning same stats
i was under the impression before that
both stats and the config were linked
under the same name
that makes it a lot easier now that i know haha
yea exactly
configs are never actually linked
only stats can be
that's great, only question I have now is if this is possible under a single queue
or if this method is the only feasible method of accomplishing what I want to do
these issues I addressed were issues I found trying to execute my idea under a single queue
appreciate the fast responses by the way, the clarification is a ton of help
yea thats not possible
it would be a bit strange to have diferent MMR changes in a single queue
hm, I don't think it's too strange, but maybe it's a difference of perspective
it's alright though, the caveat with this method is that ELO adjustments won't be applied to the individual players in a queue based on their individual rankings, but rather the queue itself; it might be a rough change for our players coming in where their individual ELO was adjusted according to their individual rank rather than the queue they joined, but we can make it work
elo is calculated on a player by player basis
its not just a flat amount
unless we tick the static argument in the mmr change command?
correct
for our purposes we do have that ticked
however by this point we'll just see how this method performs for us, and hope the feedback goes relatively well
yea, the dynamic MMR is a pretty large part of how the elo works by default
we could tick off the mmr static change in the future to see how that performs for us as well
again, thanks for the quick responses, appreciate the clarification and the help man
no prob
but yea if you are looking for MMR changes to be dependent on player ratings, i disable static
definitely, we just also want it to be dependent on the role each player has earned
we'll experiment first though üòÑ
Havent made any changes that I'm aware of but the bot isnt dragging people in and out of channels. Is there some command im missing to reactivate it?
Did you delete the lobby channel you set?
no, should i try setting it again?
I'll see what happens when we queue again
yeah when the voting is done its not moving us to team VCs either, just creating them
why are there only a few players in my server's leaderboard?
we have like 15 people who've played games, but only 4 people showing up on the leaderboard
how do you restart a queue with previous configs?
/config load
And deleting everyone stats is /managestats reset
is there a way to delete everyone's peak mmr?
but not the other stats?
yeah i want to keep people's current mmr
Oh wait no
but some people have incorrect starting mmrs
This is the command to reset everyones mmr `/managestats reset mmr `
But if u want to adjust individually just use `/add mmr`
for peak mmr, use `/set peakmmr`
just set it back to the starting MMR value and it will update after everyone's next game
is there a way to set people to not show up on the leaderboard
until they have a requisite number of games?
`/leaderboardconfig requiredgames `
how come for some players, on the leaderboard, they show up as their discord IGN
but some people show up as their server nickname?
might be discord? idk
might be a dumb questions but is there a way to link a queue to multiple discord servers?
I want to make a global leaderboard for a queue
you would need the queues to be sharing stats
you dont have that right?
I haven't made the queue yet
its a new one
oh, well if you have multiple queues sharing stats, then viewing either queues leaderboard will show the same stats
that's awesome
tyty
Sent in an mmr reset. Will that maintain what the roles are worth to the queue?
wich roles
but mmr reset wouldnt affect something else than stats id say
I made roles that dictate the mmr startingbpoint
For example Onyx 1500 = 1 MMR
/rank 1
Also do y'all the reset manually?
i‚Äôm not following
<:hmm:1172617247320195123>
Ok so im trying to reset all the mmr of a queue
i made roles that dictate starting mmr for individuals when they join the cord
and im trying to do it now
and it doesnt work?
what are you stuck on?
i reset and it says to confirm which i type in
then no ranks change
what did you do
Is there a way to verify the current starting mmr information for a queue? I've been having some issues with starting MMR where users are appearing to not be assigned the mmr they should have from /startingmmr set
Although it's happening inconsistently
you can check /info
Oh I think @ everyone was overriding in some cases... might be resolved
i think the guy need to do /autorole sets or /autorole reset so the members get set to the correct role for their mmr
sorry /autorole refresh
so you can change the players mmr, then /autorole refresh so the bot correctly assigns the role unless i‚Äôm mistaken on what he‚Äôs asking
no it should pop up a modal
But he says it doesnt reset?
I did that already
And it didn't reset
you see this message pop up?
It did now
Great!
I'll update if it actually resets
check your leaderboard
Worked it seems
I'm needing to requeue and test it with more than just me
So I'll do that in a few thanks guys
Works
So now I'm scheduling leaderboards and wondering what to do after the following ‚Äî
leaderboard scheduling still wont work
Mmm so it's still not working altogether.  Got it.
That reset worked so well and now we are going off balanced mmr so things are looking up. Do you happen to have a video on how to do tournaments?
Nope
Ok üëç I‚Äôll mess with it a bit
Any specifics I should look out for? Or anything you want me to comment on as I test it?
Tournament still on beta
Is simple direct elimination i think so
yea its very simple
kinda forgotten about
Possible double elimination?
Also when changing queuetype does it require me to reset everything? As in timers for queue dump and voting?
I‚Äôm trying a scrims lobby idea out
no, changing queue type does not modify the config much
I remember someone brought it up the other day and I forgot which variation was best for scrims.
Reason I ask is when I test it it didn‚Äôt let me get more than the captains into the queue
I didn‚Äôt have full teams and it didn‚Äôt carry to voting for maps and modes as well
I‚Äôm trying full team v full team and now I‚Äôm making sure to require full team on queue setup .
And I can‚Äôt test it bc it requires me to have full teams‚Ä¶?
well if the queue type changed to full teams, then yes you must have a full team
Right so I can‚Äôt test it then?
Unless I have 7 other people? Also
you would need a full team to test yes
Should I just put select team on join then?
For scrims?
thats up to you really
But it wont save data as teams
either can work
no, stats are still individual
Ahhhh so party doesn‚Äôt do anything specific for team stats
correct
Where it says team1 and team 2
Anyway to change this?
You might want full team vs full team instead of select team on join?
Tried it but it didn‚Äôt work as smoothly
It didn‚Äôt let me test it well either
I can try again
Change it to what?
the team names?
Where it says team name1
Im going to try out the FT v. FT
See how it pans out
Any time in the future yall will take into account team stats in FTvFT
I didn‚Äôt make this change here but it‚Äôs asking me to either solo or team queue here in a different queue now?
You made a party?
/party disband
or disable `/partyqueue`
`/teamnames`
Gotcha
Thank you!
<@145305657237700608> how to set the commands to be used only by the staff etc ?
Apart from the stats command
I just don‚Äôt want people to be using the commands etc.
Every time someone writes ‚Äú/‚Äú it showing all the commands üôèüèº
youll have to hide them in your server integrations
but by default, only staff can use them
Hello
the bot got bugged for me on my server
I am missing the Manage Channels permission, which I need to move and create channels!
Check my server permissions and any channel/role permission overrides!
it says this
but he got all perms
and also i cant join or leave queue
must be missing some permissions, check the category perms too
it was working until now
i dont see the queue
i was setting it up
like in my server there is 2 queues
i finished 1st then i went on to the 2nd
and when i tried to do autoroles set
it said this
but before that everything worked
i think it got messed up when i did like who can see the channel
but i gave him perms and all
i cant even endqueue
aaaa
when its not private channel it works
nvm its done i figured it out
<@145305657237700608> the bot deletes the text channel when the queue ends?
We just gave it manage channels permissions and started adding maps then it deleted channels
the text channel it creates?
Oh is it supposed to be creating its own channels?
if its enabled yes
Let me see
It creates the channels but then won‚Äôt pick maps
It‚Äôs creating a channel then deleting it when the queue is done and repeating that
probaably missing permissions
Is there a recommended permissions list or something? Or should we just give it all of them?
just the default permissions
your category is probably denying them
How do I make it so mmr gains are dependent on team balancing?
thats by default if your didnt enable static MMR
Oh how do I disable static
nvm Ty
Someone can help me to config the bot in the MMR section, I have problems with the mmr
- I want teams to gain 30 MMR and vary up to 40.
- Lose 15 to 10 MMR per game

I tried different methos but doesnt works
We got all of it figured out. This thing is actually unbelievable <@145305657237700608> bravo.
Is there a way to make a command admin only like /leaderboard
easiest way would be to hide any commands in the server's integrations settings
otherwise /staffrole command deny should be another way
can anyone explain the per player vs per team mmr change?
I have started 2 queues in my server
and there is not different mmrs
like I wanted to
if someone loses in 5v5, it counts for 3v3
anyone know how to fix this
are the queues named the same?
otherwise you may have enabled server-wide stats in the initial setup
Is there a way to turn off the notification it sends every time the bot creates a new temp channel?
Or is the fix for that turning off temp channels?
the DM?
Nah just like general discord notifications when the temp is made and people/neatbot start sending messages in it
it will mention everyone in the game when the match starts
apologies if this is an issue, but is the MMR adding and subtracting random amounts?
i set it to static +/- 50
theres no randomness in the elo calculation, but for  your question did you set it to static before the match was created?
I don‚Äôt know how some got 65.3 and others got 61.6 and 65
i‚Äôll run another and see if it does it again
hey guys so a player lost his streak after a match got cancelled does "/set streak" give it back?
cancelling a match shouldnt reset the streak, but yes you can use /set streak
If we enbled server wide stats during setup is there a way to reset that so seperate queues track seperate MMR or do we have to do a full reset for that? <@145305657237700608>
disable `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide`
then for the existing queue, use
`/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set name:`
to the old name
and by old name u mean?
Just name it something else?
it should auto complete the old name
to link to the current stats
Oh I see
I did it in the wrong one
Believe I got it though thank you
It has all the same permissions as the other channels its working in
Or is that because I split the queues so they seperately track MMR?
disregard lmao jfc
wdym?
It was a font thing
But now the bot is saying its missing manage channels perms again which it most definitely has
<@648635725964902411>
Did you check category perms?
Or if you gave the bot a role, make sure that role doesnt override the actual bot ones
Those are category perms
This is the role
Check neatqueue Role perms and that role you created  has to have the same ones
Im freaking out man
it was off in the bot role
It still isnt working after I turned it on
It matches the role we gave it exactly
And what does it say?
I didnt realize it was a different error
One second
Now its saying manage channels again
I just went back and double checked the role we gave and the neatqueue role and they both have it
<@171418933977546752>
Our thing is so messed up
hmm thats weird
It almost looks like its a voice channel thing now
because it isnt creating those
but its still sending all of the setup messages and stuff fine
We just said f it and gave it all admin and its all working now
Yep thats an easy fix
is there a way i can make a queue bigger than the teams that will be in game? for example, if i want 2 teams of 4 but i want captains to choose from 10 people and the 2 people who aren't chosen to have to sit out. is there a way to do that?
no that‚Äôs not possible
how can i make a team and invite a buddy
i like this support channel gives all the support i need
so, you waited 8 minutes, then ran out of patience?
interesting
it got banned for an hour by accident
how can i get unbanned
dont know if this is a known bug or a setting that ive accidentally turned on however when we vote for team captains NO = yes and YES = no
its weird so if we vote no for certain captains it makes them the captains and if we vote yes it turns down the captains and gives us a new option
What options?
/player unban
captains, random
Theres 2 vote menus, team selection that has, random, balanced, captains, unfair, if you select captains, there will be another vote menu, where you choose how captains are going to be selected, random, H Rated, L rated, Votes or balanced
we choose captains then random normally, but if we vote yes to the captains it denies it
Wdym denies it?
Have u re read the question it asks when u randomize captains?
like we would have 6 votes for yes for the having the captains and 0 for no and it wouldn‚Äôt go through and make new ones
If you vote yes it will randomize again
is that new because normally when we voted yes a couple weeks back it wouldn‚Äôt randomise again
Since when you have bot?
It was an update like 2 weeks ago i believe
yeah we‚Äôve had it for a while but we haven‚Äôt played again until just now
would I be correct in assuming that decay would occur globally to stats across queues in a server if you only have one queue implement decay
i.e. 0-700 MMR doesn't have decay, but 700+ has decay, thus if both queues are stats linked in the server both queues will experience decay due to 700+ MMR queue
Queues with the same name share stats but no configs
Tested the tournament. Nothing happened
did you have teams join?
I used /test and I got to 8/8
oh, it shows "Ready Up" now
and if you click the link in the title, it should show the bracket
the bot will automatically create a match if both teams are ready
Nice
Now my question is. Is there a way that teams can be created by the bot?
no, the teams must be formed by the players currently
Got it
Also there‚Äôs no way to edit how it looks?
It‚Äôs not considered its own editable queue?
There‚Äôs no maps or anything saved of course because it doesn‚Äôt let me load a config to edit from there
hm i guess you would need to add it back
Damn. Anyway another queues info can be added to this queue?
Also, I'm guessing you only have the single-elimination version of this bot ?
ill make it so if there is a queue in the channel, it converts it into a tournament
I put it there
The one on the right üëâ  shows its not possible at least on my end
Thank you üôèüèº
right, they share the same stats, but if one queue has it such that decay occurs and one doesn't, wouldn't the elo for BOTH queues be affected by the decay of one queue, since stats are synced
it's not like stats suddenly become unlinked
because decay acts on stat that is linked serverside
and because decay applies globally in one queue, because the stats are synced serverside, decay in one queue would affect all other queues with the same name
that‚Äôs correct
see what I'm trying to do ATM is limit who can access the decay queue to a certain role that has earned said queue
you can just disable decay in other queues right?
which in theory would not functionally work
because the stats in both queues would get affected by the one decay queue
i‚Äôm not sure what you are stuck on, the stats are shared yes, it makes sense decaying in one effects both
even if decay is off for the other queues
I'm outlining the issue that if I want decay to affect only a select group of people where MMR is linked, that is not possible from what I'm seeing
it should only decay people who are on the queue‚Äôs leaderboard iirc
would have to double check
lb and stats are separate if the stats are linked?
what if someone no longer qualifies for decay queue because they fell out of the role required to access it, and can no longer access it
the bot only knows who queued, not if people qualify from what I'm being told
leaderboards can be different yea
different queues can have different role requirements
so the leaderboard would show different players
so if a user falls out of the mmr required to access decay queue, but they at one point queued in decay queue and appeared on the leaderboard:
- will they be removed from the leaderboard if they no longer meet the requirements
- if not ^ will decay still apply to them since they still appear on lb
if the second situation applies, the issue arises that they are decaying in an mmr range that they should not be decaying in because they are not playing games in the decay queue that they cannot access
hmm nevermind it looks like it decays all players with stats
to recalculate leaderboards
might be safe to change that to only touch players who are on the queues leaderboard
to your question, if you fall out of a queues requirements then you won‚Äôt show on the leaderboard
if you use /rolerequirement
alright, guess we'll just need to wait for that change then. Hugely appreciate the fast responses man
no prob
yea i think simply changing to only decay players who are visible on the leaderboard should be fine
way to disable this?
no there‚Äôs no toggle for overfilling a role
damn unfortunate
How can i delete a queue?
/endqueue
I deleted the channel where the queue was, so i can no longer use that command
But i forgot if it counts at still running
I wouldnt say so
im assuming you can run multiple queues, but if i ban a role can I ban them from one queue specifically or does it get banned from all of them? I want to make it so certain roles can only join certain queues.
If you want so certain roles can only join certain queues, the best option is `/rolerequirement`
it‚Äôs deleted automatically then <:thumb:711064979012321290>
One of my queues will only accept three votes in the cancel menu before no longer allowing votes. I've ran `/requiredvotes cancel 5` for a 8 man queue which hasnt fixed it. Anything I'm missing?
could you share the config code?
YBHEM
<@145305657237700608> How do i allow players to use the command /stats only ?
i dont want the otehr commands to show up
Hmm a hacky solution would be setting a staffrole that only can use /stats, dont know if it can affect more things, or another solution is disabling the use of commands in your server for that role, and you do /statsbutton, other players can click the button my stats, and it will show for them without using the command
in your servers integration settings, you can hide commands per role
would be an easy way
But that will disable all comands
only the ones you select
annoyingly it‚Äôs something that can only be done through Discord, the bot can‚Äôt do it
Are you doing it in another channel though
ive created a channel only for stats
Link the queue
got you
need the 8¬¥s server
did you get to  this by any chance Neatz?
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> What about the clear queue or end current queue? can we setup permission for the players to cancel the queue if one the players that joined the queue doesnt show up?
Thats a command by default, the canceling one
Ending the current queue is different
i just dont want people to be able to input "/" and show other commands you see?
if they are not mods they cant cancel the current game
can any player of the current queue use " /cancel "
/cancel wont cancel the game instantly, it brings up a vote menu, /outcome cancel is the one that cancels it instantly (Only admin use)
But as neatz said, you can change the role perms to use commands
<:PeepoHeart:1171269076971180042>
you can hide commands via the server integration settings
not yet, no update today
Gotcha thank you
Hello, what is the command for reseting the w/l record ?
Hello, is there a way to when. Chosen captains, change the 1 2 2 system to a 1 1?
`/captains drafttype `
`/set wins` and `/set losses` for everyone i think will work out
For some reason a queue took away another queues level
Some people that did ‚Äúchamps‚Äùqueue had a certain rank then did our ‚Äúopen‚Äù queue and then they went from one rank to a completely other rank
Batford went from 37 to 10 then we took him back and he had 10 still even if we requeued
the queues probably have different leaderboards?
Yes they do
But when they queued back into the other they didn‚Äôt go back to the previous rank
did they finish a match?
So batchford had 
37 in champions 
10 in open 
10 in champions
In that order
And I don‚Äôt believe he played his game in open after all
But when he requeued in champs it didn‚Äôt go to the original champ rank
Hello! How can I adjust a "winning" team with push buttons?
I have it in a server but I don't remember how to set it up for another
` /staffchannel set`
I will try it!
Thanks!
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> I need you guys to reset my queue ASAP
guys please lmao there are 100s of text channels popping up
What did you do bro
Just end it rn
I did
it says there is no queue
and its spitting out 1000s of text channels
Neatz has to clear the backlog for me
We are getting logs error every second
idk what to do
I cant do anything
Just to wait for neatz
I'm deleting as fast as I can but they are endless
How manu channels lol
It will stop at 500
its gotta be getting close
its just overloading
It keeps making channels thinking there are people in the queue
yeah we're having problems as well
<@145305657237700608> did you have a solution to this?
looks like that config has the required votes for cancelling set to majority
thats not what you see?
Yeah it used to be on 5 and it wasn‚Äôt doing that, so I tried majority which would also be 5
is it working now or no
I was abt to say no but I bet this queue was created after the change was made so let me try a brand new one
<:Sadge:1156321130211201105>
oh i see
also its not actually canceling right?
its just ending the vote too early
Correct
Always stops on the third vote
yea seems like its using the "default" vote requirement for figuring out when to end the vote menu, but using your new vote requirement to determine the outcome
Default shouldn‚Äôt be on 3 at all unless I made a mistake
looks like your `/requiredvotes default` is 3 currently
so thats why its ending at 3
Is that a server wide command or queue specific
queue specific
Huh. No clue how it got to three then I must‚Äôve messed up at some point
<:Shrug:1171270284670668830>
Alr it‚Äôs on 5 now I‚Äôll get them to cancel the next one as test
yea that should work fine
ill be sure to fix that though
Yep it worked thanks as always
i used /test to check my configuration, is there a way to disable it
run /test again
is there a way to call on the queue interface, i had used /misc purge and it had removed all messages in the channel including the ui
if you had a queue message it sholdnt had be deleted
its alright i just loaded the config and it appeared again
you can always just /clearqueue
knowing it‚Äôs beta, are there any commands for tournament matchmaking?
Nope
like what?
just looking for an overall guide and wanted to read up on what i could do with it before implementing it. didn‚Äôt know if it could update a bracket, generate a fixed vc for a tournament t lobby, manually create temp vc for next matches, etc.
the way it works is when two teams ready up, it will create a match like how matches are normally created
you can manually change outcomes to modify the bracket as well
How many queues can i create in 1 discord?
Free plan max 3 queues at once
oh is there a reason why i only have 2 active queues and cant create a 3rd one
You must have one that you didnt end
oh okay
sometimes when we create two teams and two voice channels are created, one of the vc vanishes. i‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs bc they all join one temp vc channel to discuss host, etc. anyway to prevent this from happening?
yea, when everyone leaves the voice channel it is automatically cleaned up
after 5 more minutes though
does that sound right?
yeah, just about. haven‚Äôt timed it yet. any command to increase the clean up timer?
no thats a built in thing
you can verify in the audit log to make sure thats the reason its deleted
i wouldnt mind extending that timer though
is there a way for someone to volunteer to the captain role after a queue is filled, opposed to randomly selecting or voting for captains
On the results page what happened to the override to select the winner with 1 click.
thats the /staffchannel
sorry I must have renamed it.
for the past 3 games I havent seen this
maybe you changed permissions?
Haven't touched any permissions for the bot
Any permission I should double check for NeatQueue or work around on how to get this back <@145305657237700608>
did you end queue or make a new queue
Just played Queue # 41-43
Should i make a new queue?
Nevermind! I fixed it by changing the staffchannel from one channel to another and it came back
Hey guys, I know it‚Äôs on my end but do you know what I could change to fix this? The bot has staff perms so it should be able to do anything
The message is clear, check if theres any roles overriding or channel perms
Did u give him admin? Or just mod
Yeah it has staff perms, it seems like the Text channel is overriding or something, should I just make a new category?
Just check the perms
its weird it has all perms, but I made a new category and it works now. must just have been something overriding in the parent category
all good now
Thank Don btw
is there a way i can get the bot to drag people to my own channels i made or is that not a thing?
i just added the bot yesterday and am messing with everything and getting used to it all
You mean, when a match starts it drags you to a defined channel?
yeee
nope
gotcha okay thanks
Hey, so what command do i need to enter to force people to join a vc to be added to the 8's que
we forever having people join que not wanting to join
Thats not really possible at all
Theres a command called /startfromvc, that will start the queue with the people that are in vc
But its manually
Hey guys, I have a question. Is there a way to disable the "team selection" ?
Wdym?
What you trynna achieve
Whenever I create a new queue this selection menu appears
Because it needs to create the teams
Is there a way to remove this option?
You can remove the options, but you need to set at least one that always will be selected, because the bot needs to create teams
`/teamselection` you can choose in the dropdown menu
the thing is you can use /voice channel required, i just cant work out how to mset the channel but ive seen it done
oh you mean after the match is started?
nah prior
to physically join the que
thats not an option
voicechannel required means you need to join the queue vc that is created to start the game
not to the queue
damn, keep getting trolls join queue with no intention of showing up
/player autoban *
yea no worries, thanks for help though
is there a way to speed up the bot to automatically drag everyone from the queue to the "queue" vc channel? its taking about 2 mins after queue is filled
You must have ur queue in matchmaking type?
correct
That means:
Players join the queue, and once there are enough players within their MMR range, a match is created.

So it will take minutes to find players within their MMR range. You can easily change it via `/queuetype`, and setting it to *PUGs/Normal Individual Queue*, this means the match will be created when the queue is full.
kk, ill try that, thanks
worked, thanks boss
Hey I did /test on my queue but now idk how to undo it. Any tips?
/test again
What if I keep getting this message when I try to end /test?
theres a problem with voting now
keep getting another randomize captain after the first one? idk why
played over 300 games without this issue before
even though everyone voted yes on the firs tone
you voted to randomize the captains
or is it cuz they didnt all 6 vote for yes?
another game it kept randomizing for 4 times
it asked if you want to randomize captains, people said yes, so it randomized the captains
oh, why does it ask that?
before it would ask "are captains ok"
how do i set it back? been a while since ive used the bot
the wording was changed a few weeks ago now
you cant change that
so.. just vote No.
correct
thank you
is there a way to get a double auto ping?
as in two roles get pinged?
not currently, its a single role
gotcha
Any workaround you can think of? like is there a way to combine roles in cord?
only thinking would be just a common role instead of 2 different ones
I wanted to know how I can start the Queue without having to join the voice call and go straight to voting
change your `/voicechannels mode`
<@145305657237700608> Can the bot have a report system for those players that join the queue and dont show up?
If I ban a role and say even I have it would that ban me?
And I say me because I‚Äôm an admin but also have a particular role that many others may have
For example I want to ‚Äúban‚Äù people from queuing that have the Elite role . But allow people that have the champ role to obviously still queue
But what if some people have both roles?
Banned and unbanned
if you have any banned role, you wont be able to queue
Got it
Hmmm
if you only want certain roles to queue, you should use `/rolerequirement`
Awesome
`/bannedroles` would be more applicable for some role you give to cheaters
That‚Äôs perfect
<@145305657237700608>
maybe could go in the `/anticheat`
Other question do the role requirements accumulate?
As in
Would individuals require all the roles under role requirement
Or at least one
also is there a way to check what banned roles there are currently
just one of them
`/info `
Can people vote in the anti cheat?
What does it do the anti cheat?
it shows a message in the anticheat channel and flags the player
And can I setup a rule to ‚Äúif the player have a certain number of reports gets x and y amount of days banned or?
I think would be nice if the players in the current queue could report the no show players
<@145305657237700608> I‚Äôve setup the anti cheat to a channel. Does that mean if the player doesn‚Äôt show up on the queue we will receive a report?
no, this isnt a feature currently
there is no anticheat flag for not joining the voice channel
Maybe a good thing to add in the future, what do you think? In order to penalise those that keep join the queues and no show
you can penalize them via `/dodge penalty`
ban them for some time + take some MMR away
Do the role requirements accumulate
<@145305657237700608>
no you only need one of them
Perfect that‚Äôs great
this will be fixed in tomorrow's update
<@145305657237700608> awesome üòé please remind me!
well your leaderboard should pop up in the morning
Awesome
Question, is there anyway to know which roles have what specific MMRs?
My discord lost connection to the internet and all the messages about the changes I made went away
Specifically MMR
starting mmr?
I got it!
What is the command to make whether it‚Äôs capt or balanced without captains
Because Capt selection is to determine who‚Äôs captain
I want to just have straight balanced or captains
Got it after all
/ team selection set
Worked
Is there any way when the game queues up it auto pulls people into the VC?
Like if you queue but youre not in a voiche channel, when the match starts it auto pulls you in vc?
Right
Well if someone‚Äôs in let‚Äôs say ‚Äúwaiting room‚Äù
Can they be auto pulled into the new queue VC?
If its a waiting vc room then yes, you can set that vc as /lobbychannel
If they are in that channel they will be auto pulled
Problem I can think if someone is not at the queue because of mm
What then?
Anyway help with that?
Wdym?
Matchmaking?
Yes like they are in actual gameplay on the game as opposed to queue customs
Also. How do you give someone permissions for the bot to almost do everything but not everything haha
Like /remove player for example
best you can do is ping/send DMs
if they arent in voice, you cant magically pull them in
`/staffrole command`
Figured üëç thought I would ask
Thank you!
how do I setup NeatQueue in a private channel? it goes up to queue name and idk what to do after that
any command to choose one person at random from each team to be the host for the in game private match?
check out https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobbydetails-set, there is an example of setting a host
Appreciate it!
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> How to roll the leaderboard so it doesnt reset every month?
`/leaderboardconfig monthly toggle:Disabled`
or `/leaderboardconfig monthly toggle:Enabled mode:Rolling`
<@145305657237700608> I don‚Äôt think mine went off today ü§î
For the leaderboard
yea i realized when i said that, the update wouldnt be live by 9AM EST
which is when yours is scheduled
should be good next time though
Gotcha
Question, if someone has two roles and they both set mmr when they first queue up what happens? üòÇ
they will get the higher value
Nice love to know that
Thank you
what's the normal expected time for queues to begin?
if you are in matchmaking mode, the match will start once the players are within a close enough range
if you want to instantly start when a queue fills, switch to PUGs mode
How do you reset the points and add them to a scrim table?
scrim table?
dont understand
I wanted to know how to add points and reset them for a person.
you can add MMR, points is another feature, but you probably mean MMR, by `/add mmr`, and you can reset the MMR of a person via `/managestats reset mmr`
The //managestats reset mmr is to reset a person's points, right?
How do we remove this voting stage?
/teamselection set, just put balanced if its a 1v1 it wont matter
no we are only testing using 1v1. will be up to 3v3, needs to be randomized teams for that
Oh ok, so do `/teamselection reshuffle toggle:Disabled`
Ans also `/teamselection` to just do random
thank you, the reshuffle disable works üôÇ
How Can I Purchase Premium
you can login to the website https://www.neatqueue.com and view your server's dashboard
its not letting me, it says ''Not Enough Credits In The Server''
have you purchased credits?
got it
is it possible to set the bot to make 1 voice channel when queue is full? id like to set it so people can use the bot to find a 5 stack. would be a nice feature so other people in my server that aren't playing in a 10man can use the bot in a diff channel to find a ranked stack to game
how do i remove a queue
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> 

Good morning guys! So yesterday one of the players did not show up to the game/queue after JOIN QUEUE. The game was cancelled and the players were deducted 200 mmr instead of the player that did not show up. Also the players from the team involved has been ban for the next queue's...
Not sure abt the mmr deduction, when u dont show up you get autobanned by default
To disable `/player autoban`
To unban `/player unban`
`/endqueue`
The whole team or just the player that didn‚Äôt show up?
/player unban, for only the one who got banned
I know but all the players for that team have been banned for 12 hours and lost 200mmr
sometimes it bugs out and bans everyone when the bot is running slow
it doesn‚Äôt correctly see who is in the voice channel
You have to unban 1 by 1
How to give the MMR back ?
If you want to disable that
/add mmr
The leadboard URLs makes its own URLs and webpage?
Its just a page
The url is the neatqueue base one but with the leadearboard id
Hmm. Ok I‚Äôll try it
... try what
you already have a web leadearboard when u do /leaderboard <:Shrug:1171270284670668830>
What I want is to change like a la ta with 5-8 = 5 wins and 8 losses I want to put 6 wins and 3 losses
`/set losses` and  `/set wins`
Thanks
How to create a table and statistics?
`/leaderboard`
the message to join queue has stopped appearing at the bottom of our channel, instead users have to scroll up to find it in the thread
i need a way to get it back to being the most recent message in the channel
also, when voting to approve random captains, no and yes are inverted
the vote is to randomize captains
yes = randomize again
that's odd because until recently it was voting on if the captains are valid
it changed about a month ago
that tracks
anything i can do to un bury the queue message and make it the most recent in the channel again?
can try /clearqueue
tried that
otherwise the bot might be lagging behind
that might be the case then
we'll see if it catches up
I've set it to 4 teams and for some reason I can't get the settings to swap this queue settings , I know I'm missing something somewhere
this is showing your parties
nothing related to the queue config
Hmmmm
Ohhhh
you can disable /partyqueue or /party disband each of them
But when I get 20 plyers it's not loading
if your queue says Matchmaking Queue, switch the /queuetype to PUGs
Alright
Thanks boss
And double thanks for the quick response
I knowyou all have alot going on
Will pugs still use matchmaking?
Maybe thats where I got confused
matchmaking queues don‚Äôt start instantly when the queue fills
it waits for fair teams if possible
otherwise it‚Äôs all the same
Is there a way to get better connection to bot it seems to be delayed w setup menu, keep says starting and nothings popping up
Wordddd
Is there a way I can have 20, 30, 40 people signup for one queue and it matchmake 2, 3, 4 games to vote with or does it always have to be separated queues
make sure the bot has permissions for the channel
using /setup is instant
i‚Äôm not sure i understand
So typically I have 20-30 players , all of Wich have various Skills , I want to players to be split Higher/Lower
But without having these people to think for themselves
Because
That's an issue with people I guess
Hahaha
Can I dm you instead don't wanna do this here
any way someone could help me? once i fill my 8 man Q, it doesnt advance to where the two captains pick their teams
Anyone else having issues?
yup keep getting "this interaction failed"
<#992610856904957992> the bot is down at the moment
how long does it typically take to get it back running?
<#992610856904957992>
should show you the stats and you can add a noto for your channel to know when it comes back online
queue interactions have been disabled but the info vote system has not chaged
how can i close a queue? the winner is already selected but it hasnt posted the winner message and closed the channels
ik the bot is going on and off rn so idk if thats the issue
i cant interact with the queue at all
the bot is going off and on
check <#992610856904957992> to see the status of the bot
Does anyone know why the bot doesn't let me see the top? it appears empty on the page and that is very strange
bot seeems down
yep it keeps going down
Oh shet
ETA on bot coming back? need it for the weekend games <:PB_peepo_cry:769652989744775178>
Need it for right now cod players are going mad xD
Wont be available till NeatZ comes online
hope he comes soon
https://tenor.com/view/%E7%9A%849-gif-27299608
It's working intermittently on and off every 3 minutes or so, see <#992610856904957992> . I'm able to get commands in just fine half the time, so it's at least semi functional
Hey so been using the queue for a bit now! Is there a way to restrict the queue using roles so that players with the same role (team) can‚Äôt queue against one another? The queue is 1v1 based, so I want to ensure that within my week tourney that players on the same team can‚Äôt queue up at the same time and be placed in a 1v1 against each other. Any suggestions would be appreciated, especially if done using roles
can neatq put elo beside the players name?
`/ratinginname format format: location:`
do players have to register their Ign or no?
nope
and itll update their mmr next to their name?
bet yall are goated, thank you.
i‚Äôm not totally sure i understand what you are asking
does each team get its own role?
so that means they can‚Äôt queue against each other?
yes exactly this! 

i have 2 teams & each with its own role (ex/ @team1 & @team2). I want to make sure players in team1 arent queued up against one another & can only queued up against players in the other team
no that‚Äôs not possible
damn unfortunate thx for the reply
how can i make 8v8 ranked system for the game called pro soccer online
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
I don't speak English
/language set, then /setup
<@145305657237700608> hello

here is better for visibility
or ask a question in <#1173046426255773707>

how can I do it like this
PSO TR RANKED
just /setup
I want to do the same
PUGs or Matchmaking
How do I change the s? If i can't where does it even stand for?
you probably have a party
wdym, how to change it?
`/party disband `
oh thanks bro
I did this but if i Select team join it says there must be a party. I created two parties, one and two. Then if I click on join 1 or something it tells me that the party need 6 members??
you have your queue full team vs full team?
that means, people only will be able to join if they have a party of 6 people
Yes, i want to make people choose a captain ??
Or which i have to pick then
you want PUGs, that is individual queue, and then team selection
Is there any way to alter this cooldown?
Is there a way to dont do the whole process again, like doing a command so the bot does the exact same thing as before or something? or does it save? idk
just do /queuetype and change it to pugs
also u said you only wanted captains, so do aswell /teamselection, and just select captains
no i mean like captains choose their team and then bot makes new channel where everyone gets put in but yes. 

Also how to choose winner?
thats when the game starts
oh oke
bot down ?
<@145305657237700608>
the bot down <@145305657237700608>

It‚Äôll take as long as it takes appreciate you guys fixing it quickly
no brotha we fiends for gears of war 4
Does anyone know the answer to this? 

There was an active queue (#138 in my server) when went down, but when the players saw they couldn't vote for a winner one of my admins made a note of the teams and deleted the channels. Is there a way I can access this back, will it appear in my admin channel when the bots back up? If I already have it set to send results to my admin channel 

Idk if I'm going to need to make a queue 139 when the bots up or if it'll still let me put the result for 138
Or is there like a command ill eventually be able to use
You could try /outcome selectwinner, when the bot is back up
is there an ETA <@648635725964902411>
When NeatZ gets online
Thanks
Im not 100% sure if it will work since the channels were deleted
it won't work, you need to manually add the mmr, wins, and losses. i went through that the other day when the bot went down
is neat q down?
wont even let me q
<@648635725964902411> <:sadcat:1179569615911800842>
is the bot working fine? i can't queue even tho the bot appears as online
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/992610856904957992/1186101735694024705
Cant do something <:Shrug:1171270284670668830>
how do i get the node 1 in my channels?
Not possible
<@648635725964902411> hey don im an admin for BPL the bots back up. should we let people queue again or wait until its all clear from u guys
Also wondering
Not sure in wich node is your server in
I‚Äôm def on 2
chandler do u know BPL NA server?
I mean yall have the same problems I do at the same times so I‚Äôd assume we‚Äôre both 2
Node 1 is working fine, if youre in node 2 nothing works
Node 2 seems to be working now
All stats are reset and leaderboards
<@576121913441779723> yeah it went back up for a min now its back down
Went up long enough that I could lock queues that works üòÇ
I'll just wait for an official status announcement
online still ain't online for me
Same just enough to get everyone in one then off lol
i don't even have the queue message in the channel lmao
bot seems to be back up but im gonna wait for your guys word for when its good to start up more queues
i was just able to join queue so it seems good
it let me do that when i was testign it but then it went back down after 5 mins  so idk
now its back up
Any way to work around this?
no if the channel was deleted, the match was as well
Damn, no worries I guess
I'll have to get everyone on to remake
or just manually give them the stats
ours was just failing every interaction so this seems to be solid rn
I was thinking I wanted the queue there, I can manually add them to the queue but can I choose who goes on what team? Like when its on the captains screen?
it‚Äôll probably go down again
actually might be good
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to start the captains vote with only one person /10 in the voice channel?
Don't worry, got it now
I'm silly
down again <a:SadgeCry:1120492320459067412>
Going in and out for me
Was good enough to get my missing game queued in and resolved.
it was up for a solid 20 mins and then poof
If you're the admin of the server you're using it on, just keep a pen and paper close for tonight(just incase)
Think it'll keep going in and out
seems to be working?
yes for my server
If a match was deleted before being cancelled how do we end the match
when the node shutdown we thought we cancelled matches and deleted the channels and now we have like 20-30 matches still active but no way to cancel
if the channel is deleted you can‚Äôt cancel the match
you can just ignore them
okay, there are some players saying they can't join. One of my mods said " its telling some people theyre stuck in a queue and when i go look for it its the queues from when the bot broke"
stuck in a queue?
yeah I think I just have to clear queue tho, worked for one person
depends on what the bot is telling them really
gotcha, I'll let you know. I reset all the queues so hopefully its fine
I cant get my queue's to go to a different channel, the settings say it should be going there. it was working until yesterday when the bot was going on and offline
try /tempchannels toggle again
i voted on top.gg to unlock the stats function but not working for me yet. anyone know if there's a cooldown before i obtain functionality?
its usually pretty quick
i can just override you, one sec
try now
works great, thank you
i tried that, it didnt work
hey how can I create role and team que on my server
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
how can I find config
Config of what
`/config list`?
is it possible that someone who doesnt own the server pay for premium ?
Yes but he needs to has administrator perms or staff i dont remember
Or one special perm
Okay
doesnt work with admin perm
just tested it
Whats the rate limit?
Any way we can avoid it in the future?
How many games are u running ?
Its the limit of the channel creation, not sure how it limits since i never saw it
is it still saying that?
or was it a one off
just a one off
i wouldn‚Äôt worry about it
it has a 30 second limit for creating the match so it doesn‚Äôt get backed up and create matches an hour later
sounds good, I've never seen it before so just got worried for a sec
could be any reason it took too long
just a preventative thing
thats good tho
helps prevent the mass creation of matches again
exactly
appreciate you guys
is there a command i need to do to allow people to vote for the winner, it was working just fine, it started when the above issue started (still not working), I also updated it to 2 votes to declare the winner, i had it on one, currently only staff/admins can vote for queues.
`/message winnermessage results `
how to make all players in the server thier mmr = 0 and reset it
i have reset the mmr but all players get 1000 MMR directly
<@648635725964902411>
`/startingmmr set ` to 0, and then reset again
thank u
Is there a way to display MMR next to people's name on the server? Sure there is but can't seem to figure it out <a:Huh:905162032284852374>
Is there anyway I can make both teams join voice channel on que?
`/ratinginname format`
wich voice channel?
Team channel when match starts instead of teams going into separate channels can they join the same one?
Thank u sir, made it that far but what to put in "format" and "location"
format, for example, if you want to put the mmr inside brackets it would be [$], `$` represents the MMR, the location, **Suffix** is after the user¬¥s nickname, `Don Soap [1000]`, **Prefix**, means before the user¬¥s nickname `[1000] Don Soap`, also forgot to mention to toggle this option, `/ratinginname toggle`
this worked for a few queues, and now it is happening again
I dont think u can do that, u will need to set up a channel by urself and disable team voice channels
1 last thing lol, how to remove a queue?
`/endqueue`
my bot is still offline
Check <#992610856904957992> and <#919709100114346076>
ye I noticed
yea not 100% sure if the current issue is related
how to make the voice channels of teams anyone be able to join it ?
Either `/channel restrictions` or `/spectatorrole`, first one easier approach
``/channel restrictions`` disable right ?
thx MAN
question? 

When I have many Queues /HP/SND/CDL maps ! 

IS there a leaderboard for each or is that leaderboard for all the same?
The leadearboard will be the same if all Queues have the same name
If not, then every queue has its own lb
Yeah Each Q has there there own name and channel such but seems like i cant get the leaderboard to work right
Whats the issue
I guess i fixed it lol Seems like i have to have each leaderboard in its own channel with the Q or the leaderboard wont show up ? does this sound right?
I was trying to put all 3 boards in one channel but seems like it happen that way
You can put leadearboards in different channels using /link, but you cant put 3 lbs in one channel
ok so cant have 3 in one channel
got it
and its DOWN again üòÆ
down again, what am i paying for, for the bot to be down constantly
the bot has only really been unstable over the past 2 days, otherwise its been pretty reliable
I'm sure its with the extra server loads as the bot has gained a lot of attention lately
sry bout that
LMAO
yea <@576121913441779723> its your fault
unfortunately all the big servers are on node 2 üò¢
me ü§ù easymac ü§ù causing problems
LMAO we‚Äôre hand and hand
yea, BPL been popping off
It's also because you're a Georgia fan

is there a way to get the queue i just had
a moderator put end queue instead of cancel
`/config list` altough when u end it, it drops the config in chat
nodes assigned to server IDs have a relation to server size?
nope
2 nodes, 2 shards each, 4 shards total.
when the bot connects to discord's gateway, it assigns specific servers to each shard based on ID
is MM causing the problems? or just a side effect of the outages
i believe either MM or stats
We just converted our most popular queue to mm last night, what could i do to lower the strain on stats? Is queue button easier on the bot than a regular /stats channel
i wouldnt worry about it
generating stats by design is just intensive cuz its generating the image
if the bot slows again ill disable stats across the board
word
the idea/suggestion of joining a vc to create a queue is interesting. any info if it‚Äôll be implemented, if so, is there a time frame? jw
when node 2 stops breaking daily üôÇ
most likely early january though
any idea how many people were in the MM at once?
i never saw more than like 16
it usually has a match before it gets in the 12-13 range
hmm alright, i mean hopefully its able to handle 16, thats nothing
yeah and it was only one mm type of the 7 active in zoomafia
by far the most popular though
im gonna re-enable it
What's the difference? We queue up with 22 people at a time in our server, and sometimes have 2 queues running at the same time
matchmaking functions similar to a normal competitive game, it will wait some time until a "fair" game is found
its not as great since the player pool is smaller, but helps to only create matches when everyone is close ish in rating
Ahh, gotcha, I saw him say 12-13, and worried out 44 may be an issue lol. Since it's just a queue with captains drafting, we shouldn't be an issue, yeah?
it will usually create a match before all 44 would be able to queue
odds are there are already fair matches by 15 players
<:1pokethumbsuppika:934082668486864946>
bot is lagging hard right now, interactions keep failing
An update from earlier (<https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/857677776471588894/1186459260641620048>):

The picture collage is what the category is set to, with `@11s` being the "verification" role. The ability to view the channel, but not join VC is there.

However, the second photo is what it looks like when the queue fills up and a VC is started for the draft
hmm i‚Äôm pretty sure when a voice channel is made it copies the category perms
is the voice channel in the same category as the queue?
It is
It has started working
Can this be used to track the queue on a FiveM server for GTAV?
Hey guys, I need a bit of help. Whats the best way to create team options for a channel?
i just get 0/4 and only one voice chat gets made
is it possible to put gamemode selection before map ban?
how to transfer <#992610856904957992> messages to my discord channel?
Why does it keep going offline every night tho? My discord members keep complaining

Dont think so
Issues with some big servers or internal errors with discord
yea combination of some issues with high bot usage, and discord api instability yesterday
does anyone know?
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/857677776471588894/1186126522692665395
damn, that's why it doesn't work
maybe the watcher bot should be implemented in my channel?
If you figure out how, let me know lol
i need my own solution instead of watcher, since that bot can only see Node 2
since this server is in Node 2
Is it possible to transfer the queue I set up on a trial server into an other one? Don't need to transfer stats but just the settings of the queues
`/config save` and `/config load`
it does transfer between different servers?
configs can be load wherever
ok thanks i'll give it a try
<@648635725964902411> 

How do i link 2 queus to the same leaderboard please?
The queues needs to have the same name to share stats
Does this also mean that not having the same name for the queues will create different leaderboards, or is there a process for that (if it's doable)?
Yep, stats are attached to queue's name
Understood, thank you
I have a match that got glitched out due to the bot going down so it was "cancelled", but now players are stuck in the queue and it won't let me force cancel it.
if its cancelled like that, you can delete the text channel
deleting it will move everyone out of the queue?
or out of the match I guess
so they can queue again
are they stuck?
why can‚Äôt they requeue
Voice channels are not making a channel limit
Like anyone is able to join the vc, is there a way to do that?
Cause I‚Äôm having the same issue where I think anyone is able to join my channel
`/channel restrictions`
Or like it‚Äôs weird, cause I don‚Äôt think people are able to see the VC, but are able to join and stuff
You changed it?
Or added any spectator role
No I don‚Äôt think I did
Cause I made the queue after copying a config from the config list
And found some of my settings from the queue were changed
If that makes sense
Check out /info
Channel restriction should be enabled
if you copied a config it might have a spectator role
yeah cause i think i removed the spectator role, i hoped the channels restriction fixed it, but well see
Prob yes
btw my leaderboard is broken in discord rn
but it works through the link
any fix to this or just wait?
oh, nvm its just for the month rn
how do i make it so mmr rolls onto the next month?
also does mmr reset?
`/leaderboardconfig monthly`
If you activate it then yes
Altough do this on january 1st, if you do it now it will count like the month started today
<@145305657237700608> i forgot to renew the plan and the bot save my queue configs, but when i load them, the queue image dont appear, and if I load it again, the image still not appearing
queue image and the thumbnail
did you renew premium before loading?
Hey guys, has stats been disabled temporarily? Everyone else getting that?
also when people join queue how do i make the bot choose captains
/captain selection - select random
Hi guys need a bit of help...

Long story short 
Game: Assetto Corsa
Battle Style: King of the Hill
Imagine a COD deathmatch
I need majority to have to vote or a way to have players lose rank/gain/stay stagnet??
So if there's 8 players lets say
#1 Gets most elo
#2-3 Gain some maybe 
#4 Draw? Nothing? IDC? lose ELO?
#5-8 Lose elo
Is this plausible or somehting along the lines
________
Or worst case I just want a FFA system where only 1 guy wins
Thats not really possible
how do i make it so only captains vote on map selection and win/loss report
Is it an error that's server specific?
Or is this happening to everyone
I started getting this error too
Same, have this issue when navigating leaderboard
what can we do?
<:prayge:808768453992906804>
Same here
it‚Äôs not an error, it‚Äôs disabled intentional
the message says that
I see thank you
when it will be available again?
i‚Äôve turned it back on now
Thank you
hello! can anyone help me with this? How can I make a queue where it shows the teams like this? team 1 and team 2
`/queuetype` full team vs full team
thanks!
how do i delete configs? thanks
Wdym? You cant delete them
i wanted to name configs but it said name already taken?
Yeah, you cant delete configs
Is matchmaking back up or no
looks like it is
configs are universal available, so you can delete them
Okay thanks for info did you mean *cant Btw?
hey guys, theres a player in my server that just cannot play in any matches, if hes in the queue and it reaches the start minimum (8) the game doesnt start until someone leaves to make it 9 and then they will be in not him, anyone got any idea why or how?
yes, can‚Äôt
oops
you have Matchmaking queue
Players join the queue, and once there are enough players within their MMR range, a match is created. (So probably that person doesnt fit in the mmr range, so it wont start with that person)

So it will take minutes to find players within their MMR range. You can easily change it via /queuetype, and setting it to PUGs/Normal Individual Queue, this means the match will be created when the queue is full.
ohhhh
thank you so much
Hey people can i change the players requeriment of 8 to 4?
What is the command?
You mean teamsize?
/teamsize
How would I go about getting premium?
https://www.neatqueue.com/
Login -> Dashboard
Much appreciated, thanks!
For auto roles does it have to be per queue or do they all sync?
it‚Äôs a per-queue config
is there a faster way to do it instead of having to type the command over and over for multiple roles?
you can use /autoroles copy
or just /config save and /config load
to copy all settings
im slightly confused haha
hey guys in BPL C were getting this error in every queue
https://i.imgur.com/hZJBdWn.png
I understand now, thanks!
every channel?
i still cant get my queue results to go to the channel I enter in the command, is there a command I am missing? it was working for the first 288 queues, since then it stopped working
Our mains one are getting it rn
We had to shut it down
let me revert the last change
thats the staffchannel, you want /resultschannel
or is it the same
is there a difference between the 2? I found the results channel command right before you sent this
yeah its kinda going crazy in here i cleared all the queues and it wont make a lobby at all
Staff is where staff can change/revert results
Staffchannel is a channel where you manage/see the Queue results
lets see in a sec
unlock
is a mod able to hop in a vc and kinda go over a couple things with me?
you can unlock
Kk thank you
if not all is good just need help figuring a few things out i don't see listed on the documentation
can‚Äôt hop on call but feel free to ask questions
can make a forum question if you have a bunch
previously when a queue filled it would list everyone that was in the queue as seen in the above embed but almost a year later it just shows the bottom embed (i dont believe any settings were changed)

is there a way to have it show everyone that was in the queue after its completed when theres only one team? /misc mention didn't work but presumably that's because no teams are being created

the queue is set to 1 team and teamsize of 8

code: QEVEN

thanks!
hmm i guess queuing with 1 team doesn‚Äôt display right
How can I get it to where the names the show up the on the queue instead of the number of players in the queue?
<:hmm:1172617247320195123>
can u rephrase that
Currently, when people queue into the bot I get a "number" of people who are in the queue. What I am looking to do it to have the names of the players (discord names) in the bot.
<@648635725964902411>
disable /anonymousqueue
Thank you so much!
That worked
I was so lostüòÇ

grrr
How do i remove captains in a 1v1 qüòÉ
/teamselection
is matchmaking down again <a:SadgeCry:1120492320459067412>
no i didnt disable it
our mm is working
ive noticed player `/cancel` is immediately causing issues, i wonder if its related to the larger issues. in zoomafia, matches that are vote cancelled nearly always have some sort of error attached, either the bot doesnt delete the channels, or they get error messages when requeueing saying that they must vote on their previous queue before joining another, despite the queue being cancelled
any idea if its when matches are cancelled before/after the teams are created?
is it working for you?
maybe just slow?
its working now yeah just slow
wonder if the bot is slow, or you need to increase the matchmaking leniency / range
ours isn't deleting channels as well, I've been manually doing it post-cancel
also players are getting put into multiple matches at once, even if they didn't queue
our mod just got thrown into a match randomly lol
uhh are they sure they didnt click queue at some point
as buggy as things are, i cant imagine it randomly pulling someone in
yeah I'm positive
It put the same person into 4 matches at once earlier
i'm sure the constant cancelling isn't helping as well
so it does the countdown, then just doesnt do anything?
yeah, its like saying 

Player X didn't join, channels deleting 3 mins ago!
and if we can as staff its saying the match is cancelled but the channel just chills
ok, so the automatic cancel when a player doesnt join
both
which also requeues the active players
like if I just cancel a random match going rn, itll say its been cancelled but doesnt delete
how was it cancelled
that was auto
but like this one I cancelled and it just stays there
The bot didnt send a message saying it was cancelled?
nope
even now I closed the queue and matches are still being made
like ended the queue
its weird, my MENA server isn't having any issues and that one averages the same amount of matches as BPL-C
yea, im testing in this server as well and its instantly responding without any issues, same with cancelling
does MENA do matchmaking as well
just pug but that's what has been having issues the last 2 days
I switched bPL-C to PUG again and same issues
I just switched it back to matchmaking for now
MENA actually hasn't had any issues period since last Friday, but im guess that's on Node 1
yea probably
let me check
Tomorrow i will upgrade the node 2 machine and also look into if its feasible to set up a custom machine for specific servers
so you can just invite the special bot
and itll have dedicated hardware
let me know if we can help in any way
hopefully shouldnt be hard since its already set up to work across multiple machines
website supports it as wel
but yea, seems like many of these issues are just coming down to some performance stuff
it is what it is, it'll get better
How do admins switch up teams manually.
When needed
Say after a balanced queue goes through but we think it would be balanced if we had a ‚Äútrade‚Äù feature lol
Where can i find the premium subscription for my discord
www.neatqueue.com Login and then go to dashboard
gotcha, makes sense, I had them both going to the queue results channel prior to them not working, now the /results channel worked, but the staff channel command did not change it, still stays in the main queue channel
https://tenor.com/view/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-ah-shit-cj-gta-gta-san-andreas-gif-13933485

I'm gonna just hear discord pings in my nightmares
its okay
new record for earliest time to go down
Why it goes offline so often? Is it scheduled maintenance?
Also for this time its offline for a quite long time when compared to other downtimes
yeah ive never seen it down before like 6pm est
How do admins switch up teams manually if needed
thats not possible currently
although there is /substitute and /player sub
i dont recall if it works cross team in the same match
I‚Äôll have to try
Put in feature requests for a /trade command
Sometimes MMR is slightly off when going off balanced MMR which is normal esp when people are new
Good evening. Is there a way to notify a player if they are losing MMR for not playing games?
for mmr decay?
no theres no option for that
Maybe it would be a nice addition? A person receives a notification the number of seconds before the downgrade
yea maybe a one day warning would be nice
i guess configurable
Thx!
Can the queue send multiple commands and or messages out?
Or is there only one
wdym
Like I can schedule the leaderboard to queue at. A certain time
But can I send out texts and it
You cant send custom messages if thats what you mean
And or other commands?
Can I send out multiple commands a day?
yes you can schedule any number of commands
no way to schedule sending a message
im sure there are other bots for that
Understood and awesome
I've seen dozens of reports of people who voted for the winner of a queue, some even that the vote went through and the elo was awarded, saying theyre getting an error message that they must vote in queue # before queueing for a new series
do you see the text channels?
and check if the match has a winner
on some occasions yes, the staff channel will even update. on some occasions the text channel deletes but the staff channel shows no winner
basically this but at least 50 times today
they won, but lost elo?
what does that even mean
yeah idk about the lost elo part he might have been faded on that one but thats nearly the identical message ive got over 50 times
then when i go back to look at the staff channel, sometimes the vote shows sometimes it doesnt, but the solution has been running /outcome selectwinner
another extremely normal screenshot
someone just sent me that
you should be able to see the chat logs in the staff channel?
yes, every time theres 4 votes for the correct team
the 5th never shows as the channel would have deleted before it logged it
yea i would expect to see the 4 votes
from cancelling or someone not joining or what
Would have to be not joining, i disabled player cancel earlier since most of the reports from that first image were from cancelled matches
which image
reports like this
earlier today most reports of that issue were coming from matches who had been cancelled
where they said they won?
but it was cancelled?
if they cancelled a match, the channel would delete, the bot messages would delete, and the bot would move players back to the lounge vc, but then lock them from queueing saying that they must vote for a previous match
hm okay so it‚Äôs some issue with cancelling where it‚Äôs not deleting the match
Yes and no
You're right, but its also happening in matches that a winner was voted on
But it happened WAY more frequently in cancelled matches
so it‚Äôs canceling after teams are made?
Maybe I'm saying it wrong let me reset
i get what you are saying i think
it frequently happens when a match is cancelled after teams are made
but also happens when a team is voted as winner sometimes
In some queues, the players play the entire match and vote on a winner, the bot does the normal message deletion, channel removal all that. The players would assume all is well. Then the bot says they must vote on their previous queue
In some cases when this report comes in, I can see in the staff channel that the vote definetely went through, but no winner is marked on the staff channel message. In some cases, there is a winner marked, but the players are still unable to queue.
It affects the 5 voters as well as the 3 who didnt get to vote
This one just came in, player is unable to queue even though the match ended, player claims he voted. Text and voice channels were cleared and deleted by bot. Staff channel message shows no outcome, I click team 1, transcript generates.
strange it only shows 1 vote in the transcript
oh those are two different games?
Didnt even notice that, let me make sure I clicked the right transcript but i feel pretty sure I did
https://www.neatqueue.com/transcript/754130819634692106/28272
transcript for 28272 links to 28292
uhh okay that might show some other issue
sorry for screenshot spam, but this is another variation of the same issue
im assuming he means the bot cancelled due to a no show, which is why it was cancelled
in this scenario i force team 1 as the winner, then cancel it immediately after
ok if they never even made teams that‚Äôs very strange
cuz there wouldn‚Äôt even be a match to vote for
transcript link goes nowhere https://www.neatqueue.com/transcript/754130819634692106/28237
the staff channel message isn‚Äôt even generated until teams are made??
but they said the lobby never started?
yeah idk thats why i went to check transcript
yea im lost then
no lobby would mean no teams
Was there a fix to this? https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/868549627652214794/1187256877466271774 Apparently its happening in zoomafia now
no i haven‚Äôt investigated anything
don‚Äôt really have much time for the bot right now
All good brotha cant blame you
im just glad the bot hasn‚Äôt gone down tonight lmao
our bot seems to be making duplicate queues and matches
no clue what to do
what server
and exact duplicates?
Octane's
yeah like there's a match going on and also the same 8 guys are being asked to pick teams
oh i just scrolled up and saw we aren't the only ones experiencing it
what queue type
also just use /outcome cancel in the second match
i'm not 100% sure what queue type this was set up before i was modded
is there a command to check
does the queue title say Matchmaking
just says 8s queue
hm alright
pretty sure it's the default PUGs/Normal
i do see an issue with cancel
it seems to continue with match setup
that should be an easy fix, makes sense its breaking stuff cuz its continuing with setup after the channel is deleted
not sure how that slipped through my bad
All good I'd much rather it be an easy fix than a impossible to find the problem type thing LOL
this if fixed, even if you have cancel disabled this needed to be fixed asap
goat
Hey guys any issues with the bot rn? BPL ZA having issues where people can Q and then can't pick players
And at times they can't even Q
I cleared the Q since some people we're stuck in there, and completely lost our open Q
50 matches were not played today, but why are we getting this warning?
queue wont pop or we cant vote for win
Queue has stopped forcing itself to bottom of page
Also getting this rate limit now
Stats are reset when the bot posts on <#935731235790139422>
how can i do that?
You cant do anything, stats and games will reset when the bot posts in the channel
ah, understand ty
randomly not letting people vote
<@648635725964902411> any idea why BPL ZA getting rate limited?
my queue had the same message like 5mins ago <@269526551815520257>
Mine is still there
Our open Q is completely chalked at the moment
No idea
unable to create channels due to rate limit
Yea same here
how to rename my neatqueue
The bot? Just give it a nickname in your server
i changed my discord id
but nickname old
Still broken
<#919709100114346076>
Need help with MMR. it doesnt seem to be registering. I have 3 que's named the same and when players play it still just states 1000.
temporary?
you probs have the default starting mmr of 1000
or got your mmr before changing the setting
First time ive seen it say that multiple times, it usually does it once and the next one is good to go. Happening to all queues i just only screenshotted that one
yea default is set to 1000, i tried to leave everything default as far as the MMR.
Just unlocked queues to try again, same thing is happening
are there any channel pool channels?
reserved channels
yes but very few compared to normal
yea it cleans up the channels early in the morning so i would expect a few
i‚Äôll be back in a bit and can check if it‚Äôs rate limited
hm i mean it shows 1498 channels in the last 24 hours so it should be alright
maybe try again
i can decrease the threshold to start using the channel pool perhaps
bet trying again
damn
is MMR all tied together. If i set each que to a 1000, and there are 4 ques with the same name does that mean they start with 4,000?
No, it doesnt add up like that, it will be the same 1000 mmr for every queue
If u win 20 mmr in some queue now it will be 1020 mmr at every queue
Ok kool. So just to clarify if I have a s&d Que with 1000 mmr and 2v2 set at 1000. And a player ques in the s&d and wins 50 and then ques in the 2v2 and looses 30 it will show them with an mmr of 1020.
What happens if k have a startin mmr Que with 100 a Que with 500 another Que with 500 and a Que with 200. How does that work?
Every queue gets unexpected error in my new discord
Cosmic Mob?
yessir
try again in one min
okay thank you
hotfixing something
This is an issue where mmr was showing on the results but not showing when a player checked stats. They didn‚Äôt match or update.
this all depends if your queues are sharing stats or not
check out https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/910981294937210930/1180776067158511706 which explains how stats are linked to queues
Guys is the API down? Have been using it for the past few months with no issue, but now its returning a No channel found
```
{"detail":"Channel Not Found"}

```
```https://api.neatqueue.com/api/leaderboard/{server_id}/{channel_id}```
does the web leaderboard load?
By web leaderboard, what exaclty do you mean? In the queue channel, /leaderboard still works if thats what you mean
if you click the title of the leaderboard, it‚Äôs a link to the website
it uses the same API for fetching the leaderboard i believe
Oh. just checked, nope, empty
what‚Äôs the link?
https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/1092797403301679135/1094664514877804635
The actual leaderboard works in Discord tho
https://i.imgur.com/1JhhSJ5.png
try now
seems all web leaderboards werent loading
hello ! üôÇ is there a way to make it so that team captains are the 2 people with the highest mmr in the match?

Got ban for an hour 30 minutes go back and it says i still have 58 minutes to wait
/player unban
<@576121913441779723>  why am i timed out for a week ?
Please dont bring up here, bans or issues with other servers.
Idk why i have a week ban i queue up went to take a poop came back to an hour ban got off came back to a 7 day ban i just wanted to know the reason my bad
I can‚Äôt make a ticket or anything on the other channel
looking for help
went to sleep last night, coudlnt reply, but yep, works. Thanks!
Also, the matches/{server_id} endpoint seems to be returning an empty list {}
Thanks very much for the update fix, the support you provide is insane and I appreciate it
of course, guess i didn‚Äôt announce it but hopefully it‚Äôs working well
Is there a way to remove pre game voting menu?
which one are you talking about
<@145305657237700608> when it ask for team select and MMR enable or disabled
/teamselection set
/mmr change allow_disable
<@648635725964902411> /team selection set disable ??
No, you need to select at least one teamselection method
The bot wont magically know  how to split the teams
So you need to set at least one
Oh okay it‚Äôs for a card game so it‚Äôs 1v1
They can just ignore this prompt correct
do /teamselection set
and pick Balanced
Thank you
Any update on this? üôÇ
How can I make it where the higher mmr you are the lower amounts you get
can i get unbanned?
Its by default
Its the `/mmr change variance`, if u didnt set the `/mmr change set` to static, altough this only will apply if u are high mmr and play against low mmr
But the thing u want to, if its like ur high mmr win less mmr and playing against high mmr too, i would say its not possible
If you got banned in a server, we cant do anything, this is just the support and bot server, to ask questions and know updates, not a server ban appeal
hello, how can i creat a queue what command exactly shoud i use ?
do /setup
hello, how do i make the queue so its only 8 people and not 16
i need to make it where peoplw can use the bot w/permissions
Teamsize to 4
i have, it still says 16
did NQ mess up?
<@145305657237700608> ?
Wait
Config code? /config save
the bot stopped working while the drafting of teams, and i tried cancelling but it kept saying bot did not respond and now it says this, though the people playing still cannot queue again
try deleting the channel?
ok, the VCs disappeared so i think that worked thank you
Anyway to make it to where two people can be queued onto the same team?\
the matches/{server_id} endpoint seems to be returning an empty list {}


Any idea on if this is intended behaviour?
no it‚Äôs not intended, i‚Äôll be able to push out an update tomorrow for it
Alr, thanks. Sorry for the repeated msgs, was working on something and its the only missing part. Take your time!
And merry xmas guys!
How can I make the queue visible for the entire server?
Wdym?
Queue is visible for anyone unless you changed channel perms
I didn't change anything, but when the queue is full, it opens a new channel for selections, I want to make that channel visible to all server
/channel restrictions
ah okey that's what i meant thanks.
or just change the category permissions to say people can see every channel
Merry Christmas folks, Just added the bot to my server, is there an option on this for a series queue. ie best of 3 best of 5's etc etc
/bestof
just seen that, Thanks
I just posted a question in the support forum threads if you have a minute to take a look
Merry Christmas, Just a question about captains, I have Vote for captains and before you would be able to vote for all 8 players to be captain, now it just chooses 3 random people. anyone know why it did that?
did you add a captain role? otherwise maybe changed the captain selection mode
no captain role, but when i go into test mode i get the 8 players show up for selection
but when test is off it goes back to 3 peoople
i set a role that everyone has to be captain. might be a fix
no that wouldn‚Äôt change anything
are you testing with parties?
no parties
when NQ makes a new channel for the queue lobby, Can it keep the same permissions as the catergory? Just noticed when its made the channel, its not synced the permissions
no the text channel won‚Äôt be a copy of the category permissions
Okay might be an issue, as the players wont have the option to user /cancel  in the lobby text
when the bot creates a text channel it will automatically give all players permission to view/send
they have permissions to view and send, but not use application commands
oh i guess you have them disabled by default?
so yes the everyone role is turned off essentially, and users need to accept to view the discord and a role is assigned
Got it
you can use /tempchannels permissions to manually set perms for text channels
same with /voicechannel permissions
just turned on application commands for everyone role
It would be nice to set the role on the bot for it
wdym
to be able to set the role to use instead of using the everyone role
i‚Äôm not following
what role to use?
When it creates the lobby voice and text channel, to add what role to use for those channels
oh it‚Äôs not role based, it just adds the players
anything more specific would be kinda out of scope of general bot usage so you would be have to customize more manually
How to copy a queue from 1 channel to another
<@145305657237700608>
use /config save and /config load
Any way to reset neat que role settings back to default
for some reason keeps sayin git needs permission for que
if it‚Äôs a new thing popping up, you probably changed a category permission or something
but if you need to reset the bots actual perms, you can kick it and reinvite
Yeah i tried to give a role p[ermission to ban and this started happening
Everything would stay the same?
yea, but i very much doubt it will change anything
Any suggestions?
what is it saying
Ive gave the role for neatque to do everything and it still says thish
if you just give it admin it‚Äôll work, but otherwise you will need to check the category permissions
and channel perms
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> 

Can we lock the voice channels for the people who join that particular queue? Instead of people being able to go in the voice channel whenever they want?
You mean locking the channel only for people that joined the queue?
/channel restrictions
Yes please
enable?
thank you
<@648635725964902411> still let people join the call
one of the guys just joined the call
Was that guy in the running queue?
this teams right.. People are able to join the queue without being on the queue
Have u added some custom perms?
Or spectator roles
on the server the role for the 8's are VOICE CHANNEL CONNECT enable
is there a way to make it where a win is only worth slighty more than a loss?
like 1.6 v 1.3
since i use a low mmr
you can do /mmr change set
and provide both an MMR and loser_mmr
decimals dont work
so 1.3
does not work
U mean they will win 1.3 MMR?
win 1.6 lose 1.3
I dont think thats possible
Can i do a ban hero and a select hero?
i can change it to allow decimals
Until rn!
no hero selection, but check out /hero
can do bans
yeah i got the bans portion done
was looking through the cmds and didnt see a select
thanks though
some rzn it doesnt
yea i‚Äôll change it in the next update
gotcha eta?
maybe tomorrow
not really touching the bot
ok tomorrow morning i can release
will be fixed tomorrow morning
Is there any way to delete configs and queues? All i see is load, list and save. Im setting up bot with obvious trial and error.
You can end queues with /endqueue, but you cant delete configs
ok noted also when i create a queue with said config name or queue name all i see popping up is playerstats, does the queue need to be ran a few times to register stats, leaderboards etc
Wdym all u see popping up is player stats?
like ill make a chat thats setups the queue then ill make another chat with stats, leaderboards and results and ill try to link queue and the only thing popping up is player stats for the queue name and thats not what the queue name is..
can ill like book an appointment for this bot cause its quite frustrating. Still learning but it should be pretty straight forward?
depends on what you are trying to do
especially with directions on the website lol
it‚Äôs complicated since there is so much customization
right but all im trying to do is set up elo 8s with setup guide. I think i get lost at the configs and queue names with searching.
configs just copy paste a queue config
configs sharing?
is there a way to see a what is done with said config?
no it‚Äôs just a snapshot of the queue
which people can load
Are u trying to achieve just a basic 8s queue?, the basic guide is for the main commands of the bot, not like actual steps to follow strictly, did u get a config for your 8s or wut
no i dont a config for 8s i figured id make my own but here we are. Guess i was in over my head lol
i mean i have my own but the queue name isnt saving to share leaderboards
for setting up a single queue you probably don‚Äôt need any config
just need to think about what you need
U did /link, and then /leadearboard?
pretty sure i did, ima try it again, last time it didnt bring up correct queue name.
using /link is just for checking stats/leaderboards in a different channel
ye he said he tried it on another chat
I guess that chat didnt have any other queue
right i want a dedicated channel for each so its not convoluted
you should just be able to /link each stats channel to the queue channel
any channel can only be linked to one queue channel
figured it out the bot had the queue named glitched to player_stats, i selected one of and it brought up my correct queue name
for the leaderboard, stats button work correctly also sent a link to leaderboard via website
i appreciate your assistance if i have anymore issues ill contact here
you might have selected server wide stats
that‚Äôs the default name
yeah it was set to server wide that confused the hell out of me
all configs should obey that though?
same with linking
it does just under that name it was confusing me when it names the queue that default name.., I found another issues going to try it again tomorrow, any reason why the bot wouldn't pull in temp channels or start match when its listed to do so?  It just lists the queue name and hangs
u have the @Queue Ban role which is banned from queuing!
i need an admin
onn zoommafia
8s server says banned
hi, how I do to create a queue to be like  `2v2v2v2`  ?
to play arena mode in league of legends, or do i need to create team and then get into queue ?, cuz i want to be all random
/numberofteams
This is not a server for ban appeal, this is just the server about the bot and support
Hey, I just set up `/serverstats channelnames ingame` last night, and the channel shows currently 72 people in game, despite only one queue being active. My best guess is 72-8=64, 64/8=8 so there must be 8 queues out of the like 30k that dont have a result. Any help on this?
Could be bugging or sum <:Shrug:1171270284670668830>
If I create another Que for the top 15 players on leader board does the MMR stay the same or does it reset its self in new Que??
In the new queue it will be diff if the queuename is diff
Okay so just make sure new Que has same name as existing Que correct?
Yep, like that, it will share the stats
<@648635725964902411> appreciate your response and how fast you are üôèüèΩü§ûüèΩ
Wait <@447109858139832321> <@648635725964902411> there‚Äôs a way to get only the top people on the leaderboard the ability to queue in there own queue ü§î
Outside of inviting them, you mean it‚Äôll change based on that top 15
Ima have it set up where MMR roles will be set
If the drop out of MMR they aren‚Äôt in role and Que anymore
This helps out with a top player playing the worse player they don‚Äôt lose a lot of MMR
What‚Äôre the commands for that?
I‚Äôll look np, <@648635725964902411> also is there a way to make the leaderboards pop specifically on the first of the month? Also I think it‚Äôs possible to make a role specific leaderboard that encompasses all the queues or at least a particular queue in the discord but only shows the people with that role)
Wdym pop on the first of the month
Reset <@648635725964902411>
Unless I‚Äôm super faded and it already does that
I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs a month from the day I first put it up. But not on the first day every time isn‚Äôt it 30 days?
Yeah, `/leaderboardconfig monthly`, just make sure u put it on 1st january so it will reset, if u do it right now it will count as if the month started today
It‚Äôs 30 days?
Or does it change per the month?
Also anyway to do what I outlined above regarding a separate leaderboard for roles only in a particular queue
I guess so
Or prob 31
He used probably autoroles to do that
Or maybe /topplayers too
I‚Äôm running into issues rn where the bot is randomly kicking players into a new Que while already in a game in progress any tips on this??
new month
This just started happening is this new?
the channel pool?
Yeah I haven‚Äôt seen this till now
it‚Äôs a thing for larger servers
since the bot can only make so many channels
Ahhh okay thank you üôèüèΩ
Just means the server is getting bigger just great
exactly
Had a quick question I gotta update the bot for a 3 time I pretty much paid all 3 subscriptions those unfortunately are only going to last for the one month and I‚Äôm just burnt for buying all 3 huh
Wdym
Why did u pay the 3 plans?
At once
I paid them over the course of that last 4 days didn‚Äôt expect server to get so big so fast
Oh i see
i‚Äôm not following
when you switch plans it will refund the difference
<@145305657237700608> okay that makes sense I thought I was just repurchasing everyday pretty much
Appreciate y‚Äôall üôèüèΩ
Hello again! I am wondering how I can make a separate leaderboard for another channel in the server (one channel being 3v3 and another being 2v2). I created the leaderboard and somehow synced up to each other.
Did u activate serverwide leadearboard?
Also if u name the queues the same, the stats will share, so the queue of 3s and 2s will have the same lb
I don't think I have it set to serverwide leaderboard
I didn't name them the same either
It was enabled somehow
I think my mods enabled it by mistake
Thank you for your help again!
I love this bot
<:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
Hi i need help. we ran a queue and it started with all 10 people but the (who are the winners) page didnt show up. the players queue wont force stop and its saying we already canceled the match. its not canceled
with the auto roles for leader do they update automatically or do you have to refresh it manually/
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> 

I have a little issue on my server. People are able to join other voice channels without being on the queue. Also, both teams can jump on each others voice channels. IS anyway i can stop this? I want to stop people to be able to join the voice channels if they are not in the queue please. And yes i have use the command /channel restrictions in the queue channel and turned ENABLE. But they still able to join the vocie channels.
If the restructions are enabled and they still can join, thats related to your role perms or some permissions
And theres no way to avoid people in the queue joining another channel
You can try to modify it like this way `/voicechannels permissions set` and see if it works
Hey just trying to figure out how to get my autoroles for certain MMR figured out. I adjusted all the roles to the mmr id like them to sit at but when I give myself the amount of mmr needed my role isnt being adjusted
is there a command I need to put in specifically to trigger the roles to start?
Try autoroles refresh and see if that gives you roles. My server will only give roles when I do this. Not sure how to get it to update itself.
It should be automatic, and it works
How did u config the mmr ranges?
heres 1 for example. Set myself at 10 mmr and it didnt give me the role
Does a game need to be submitted for it to work? Wondering if thats the case
if you used /set or /add it would give you the role
or if you already were in the range when you added
make sure the bot has permission to give you that role
the role should be placed below the NeatQueue role
How can I check what my mmr rating is?
leaderboard or stats commands
ohhh ok thats why I guess I start at 1000 mmr and thought it was 0
appreciate it
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> how do i get premium in order to use more than 3 queues please?
www.neatqueue.com Login and then go to dashboard

hi i need help.
The bot has permissions, but it says it is missing.
I have checked and it has them. What can I do?
The error appears when creating a new queue channel.
Just check every perm, category perms, if u gave it a role, make sure it has the same perms as the neatq role
And like that
In the category  have all the permissions and in the channels as well. But when create a new queue-num channel, it does not have the permissions.
but if I put /cancel it works.
I just discovered that if I set /voicechannles mode disable . Then it works without problems.
Because is not creating voicechannels
You must have a perms override
A role overrides the role of the bot?
Yes, that was it. Thank you
If the role is above the bot's role it should have the same perms
Otherwise it wont work
Yes, it works now. thank you very much
<:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
Probably shouldnt do this but I always just give bots admin perms so there's never an issue
Thats the best solution <:Shrug:1171270284670668830>
yea i mean neatqueue requires basically all the ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù permissions so it‚Äôs not a big difference
Quick question any1 know how to display the elo next to names, or is that not possible
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=show-mmr-in-name
<@648635725964902411>
did any error pop up?
otherwise the bot might have went offline <#992610856904957992> which interrupts the match setup
you can‚Äôt submit the results in that case
No nothing. It just canceled metaphorically
Players that played that game can't requeue either
Hey I need help with the leaderboard, it works but when i change it to MMR only the first page will not load
you can just delete that channel
That fixs everything?
that way those players can queue
When i do /autoroles and set mmr the role doesnt assign to every play in the mmr range should i just hand assign or keep trying with the bot?
It also Assigned people to the wrong role
are you sure they are the MMR you think?
if you do /autoroles refresh that would update
manually assigning would just be a temp fix
yeah it was my mistake
Hi there, we have tried giving the bot literally every single permission and it still comes up with this.
Is there a way to override having to join a voice channel etc for the match to start
`/voicechannels mode`
Did u gave the bot a custom role?
And also check the perms in private categories if u have them
bot down <#992610856904957992>
Anyway to reset que?
like the bot is acting up
Its down
Is your category private?
But it can see all the channels
and has manage channels perm
Hii, I got a situation, it doenst let me unlock de queue üò¶
bot is down in EU
I see i think i may have still messed something up i tried starting another que for some players and when they reported MMR got reset
And what about the other perms?
We've given it green tick for every perm
still doesn't work \:/
The bot just have the NeatQueue Role?
another quick question. how does the mvp per match work? And can I integrate it to add extra mmr for it?
QUEUE BROKEN?
Lool myb
If i start another que under the same name does it reset the mmr? last night i thought it was explained that is how we keep the mmr going under another que i did /startque in another chanel
did i mess up?
nvm figured this out
No, now the queues will share stats
If they have the same name
<@648635725964902411> queue is down?
Does it reset mmr?
on que?
<#992610856904957992>
Hmmm maybe that‚Äôs because bot was down
mine says interaction failed
it's down
on multiple queues
The bot is not online, nothing will work
Ohh updating? Any eta?
<@648635725964902411> I will try creating a new category from scratch for the bot to see if that helps
I have to sleep first though üòÇ
hmm still not working even though its online?
An easy fix is jut giving the bot admin perms
I apologize im not used to this situation
Ah yes I don't think we tried that
These days the bot has been going through issues, so it goes down sometimes out of nowhere
Anyway to refresh the que? like delete the message and refresh it?
damn its locked hmm üò¶
huh?
What message?
Like the que message
Yeah, typing a message the queue will auto resend
<@145305657237700608> stuck choosing maps and modes
doesnt do it itself
the bot went down during the setup probs
have to delete the match and retry
How to delete?
Match?
have to delete the channel
match channel
when i /startqueue this is all im getting in one of my servers. i dont understand why. it works just find in any other server. Fix?
bot is missing perms to send messages
needs admin?
but it needs the right perms
check category and channel perms
is there a list of the perms it need somewhere
any way i can hop in a vc with someone i need some help
you can see the required perms when inviting the bot
but you need to fix some permission override
or just give it admin
okay, thank you so much
anyway to tell a ques name from a leader board?
well the queue name is visible in the leaderboard title
I was in a global que so my other que stats werent showing up i figured it out
ah gotcha
it was showing the global que stats and not my que stats
yea global queue is only for multi server stats
one last question i promise how do i get rid of the role selects again
do /roles
how do i make it to where people can use the bot again?
for some rzn i cant find it
not sure what you mean
Some reason my guys can‚Äôt use the bot
Like they‚Äôll put /
And nothing comes up for them
oh either you hid the commands in the server integration settings or disabled the permission to use application commands
Hmmm
I didn‚Äôt from what I know, any help on where to find that? Also it‚Äôs specifically in the team queue
if it‚Äôs for a specific channel it would be the channel permission
Use Application Commands
I have it set to go up 10 mmr per win but on the leaderboards it shows it goes up by 33
is there a way to fix that
How do I set up the bot in the discord
<@145305657237700608>
new here wanted to buy the bot via premium and get some support with adding it to my discord. Id be happy to pay $50 bucks for 45mins approx time to set it up in my server if admin would like to assist. hope this is allowed/ thanks
Hey guys quick Question on monthly leaderboards. I want to have monthly ones but still have the all-time data. When doing the setting is it enable monthly and enable rolling?
Just invite the bot
And watch this basic guide: https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
Did u set static to true?
Yes, check the other parameters
In `/leaderboardconfig monthly`
But watch neatZ thread :)
What are u struggling with to set it up?
Also premium is a plan for the bot, not to buy the bot c:
So I had an admin that did my bot setup for me and he has gone MIA. I am trying to update my bot for MW3 SnD maps and have it setup for captains and such. Can someone help me set this stuff up? Thanks in advance.
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
And documentation, if you are more specific on what you want to achieve, i can help you in a better way
Im trying to have an elo 8's setup for 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 search and destroy. Trying to have the correct maps setup, have the captains option for the 2 teams, have correct maps in the map pool, have a ban map vote and also a vote for teams to choose the map they would like. Pretty much a CDL snd 8s. Ill try the walkthrough and if I cant figure it out ill come back.
for the most part you can just do /setup. you can add maps with /map, you can change how teams and captains are selected via /teamselection and /captainselection
once you configure a single queue, use /config save and /config load to load the same settings into the other queues
and change the /teamsize in each
THANKS Ill give this a go!
is there a way to set up multiple map bans per team by game mode? for example, if i enable map voting for a best of 5 it limits the players votes to maps for that specific game mode, however with map bans it gives a ban vote for any map regardless of mode.
^ for more clarity i have the game mode selection set to ordered. I want each team to have 1 map ban per game mode with 3 game modes. there are maps with multiple modes to them but if they ban one, it bans it for all game modes instead of just one.
no there‚Äôs no way to do that
map bans currently always happen before the gamemode and map selection
perhaps there should be a way to make it so map bans are for each unique map and gamemode, instead of just unique maps
or make that the default
if that is a feature that could be implemented that would be awesome!
bot down
yeah
we need bot
<:ohno:1180610374257610814>
same
Hi, so we gave the bot admin perms and it seems to be working now, however after using /test and testing the queue, me and my friends got this. Is this normal for testing, or is there something wrong?
Did u join the voicechannel?
No, but it was like immediate. It banned us seconds after creating the channel
Yes, /test reduce timers
bot down again?
Do `/player unban`
Oooooh I see, thank you
Sorry I am stoopid
Is it safe to have this bot as admin?
All the perms that the bot already have is almost the same as being admin
Administrator just will make it easier to avoid perms errors
It just does not work unless we give it admin. It has manage channels perms and everything else, can see the relevant categories, but it will make a channel names #queue-13 or whatever and then throw the message that it doesn't have manage channels perms. We've only manage to get it working when it is Admin
neatqueue is an admin in my server with 28k people
not saying you have to
but we do
and no problems
Yeah theres no problem of making the bot admin
OK. I just don't understand why it doesn't work without admin. It has all permissions, we've moved the NeatQueue role above all roles in the hierarchy. It has access to manage channels and literally everything else. But it just doesn't work. It says it needs manage channels perm but it literally has it
You're sure the bot role AND the channel permissions both give manage channels right
We cannot get it to work without admin, and it's not something we really want to do
if it‚Äôs a private category, try adding the role or bot itself when creating
Yeah I understand where you're coming from, just telling you as someone with a partnered large server (not tryna be weird) we've had the bot as admin for 7 months
And not a single problem related to perms
i also understand not wanting to give it admin
yeah its just a 1 click fix
> **Why am i getting permissions error?**
> There is various reasons that can raise this error, please make sure to check the following points to solve it:

Having viewed the server from the NeatQueue role, we can create voice and text channels, move people between channels, etc. It makes no sense why the bot is giving an error.
It's no longer giving an error. When it creates the text channel it simply doesn't send any message now
might have missed, but what error was it?
wondering why my roles arent updating based on their mmr. I have the autoroles set up correctly and have double checked the mmr and I still have to manually do it
if the player is correctly within the MMR range for an autorole, make sure the role is placed under the NeatQueue role
yeah theyre all under neatqueue under roles. Was working yesterday and ive changed nothing and now its not
no updates with /autoroles refresh ?
That worked. Do I need to be doing that after every match then?
no definitely not
when a match ends it does the exact same thing
maybe the bot went down when your last match ended or something?
Ok will keep an eye on that thanks. Also another question I had when I do / stats it only seems to be showing the last 24 hours worth is there a way for it to show all time?
definitely possible
It will show the last 8 one, dont really think theres a way to display all time games, i might be wrong
oh yea if you are talking about the previous games, it‚Äôs limited to what fits üòõ
could use a stats redesign
where would I find that?
no i‚Äôm saying, i would need to redesign the stats layout to show more info
Oh ok haha yeah the leaderboard is nice just have a lot of guys confused when they type in /stats
what are they confused about?
stats show more info than the leaderboard
just that all their stats arent showing on it
For example the leaderboard shows all their games but not when they look up stats
oh that‚Äôs not expected
do you have monthly stats?
Like as in do I have monthly enabled? Only started using the bot 2 days ago so I might have some things wrong
does the leaderboard show a month?
Dec 2023
It did yesterday but now it doesnt not sure why
in discord?
actually now it does again. I re enabled monthly not sure how it got turned off
well, checking stats will show all time stats, the leaderboard shows the current month by default
which is why you can see a difference
But the leaderboard shows more games than the stats though thats what I was confused about. Not the other way around
can someone show me how to do the queue
stuff
Check channel topic
Theres a basic guide
thanks
Is the bot down?
We‚Äôre getting players stuck in the queue, placed in multiple at a time and the weird double glitch
i added the bot and paid for premiume but these comannds aint popping up/prompting?
i bought 30 credit and only gave me 28.6 credit ??
If u do `/` it will pop up the commands
hey was just wondering what would be the best way to go about having the bot randomize maps for us? We do search and destroy lobbies so like if we had 5 maps and it picks 3 for us every match
I figured it out just had to set it to best of 3 to get it to give us 3 randoms
Ah wait i didnt remember that command lol
dm me with the payments, it looks correct to me
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> 

Any chance to keep a log of the queue's/chat channel?
just for admin purpose etc
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/910981294937210930/1184542238039097384
How can I make the bot stop DMing people? I made it stop for auto roles but can I for everything?
yea disable /matchstart dmplayers
matchmaking glitch
Why is the MMR so much for a game? i set it to 20? thanks
Did u set the static to true?
Is there a big difference between the normal and the premium NeatQueue?  I'm looking to implement something similar to BPL CoD 8s.
Premium plans are for more capability of players, games, queues, and some premium features
Is there anywhere I can read up on these differences?
Log in -> https://www.neatqueue.com/, then go to dashboard
click a server u own, then click change plan, it will display the plans
also https://docs.neatqueue.com shows the premium features
but there‚Äôs not much, pretty much everything is free
Awesome I appreciate it
staff results channel command does not work for me, i have tried multiple times, over multiple days, etc, and it stays at none for our SND queue,  stays at none for our league 8s, and stays at respawn queue for respawn queue. screenshots attached.

int he screenshots you can see the command showing it should have worked but the info command shows it didnt. not sure what i am doing wrong here
in the first screenshot, it says "Be sure to mention the channel"
but you can also use `/staffchannel set`
check the last page?
you set it for all queues, so it should show in the server settings
gotcha, ill see if that works, i have ran the same commands multiple times, and the admin pieced stayed in the main queue channel
it did not work, it still stayed in the queue channel
whats that channel ID?
the queue Id is - 1176321984179732480

the staff channel is - 1190785725491335208
it says the staff channel is set to <#1176321984179732480>
when you set a server wide staff channel, if a queue has a specific staff channel it will override and not use the server wide one
do `/staffchannel remove` in the queue channel to remove the override
thank you
Hey guys, I've set up a permanent queue, I was just having some trouble setting up a leaderboard system in another text channel that people can go to in order to click on a link and bring up the neatqueue leaderboard website
you can use /link for that, and link to your queue
from the leaderboard channel
I used /link to link it to the queue channel, but what do I do from here to have a link to a leaderboard? Apologies if I'm missing something
Don't worry, just figured it out, ty!
have you done the update <@145305657237700608> ?
decimals
oh, yes
give it a shot
NICE
Yo real quick, when I select 'more' on a message and go to 'Apps', what does this 'Toggle Buttons' selection do?
you can use it to enable / disable buttons in that message
mostly a utility i use honestly‚Ä¶
quick way to prevent people from clicking queue or whatever
Ah okay, I tried selecting it and it's just been loading. Is there a way to cancel and try again or is there a reason why it's not going through?
i guess if the message isn‚Äôt from neatqueue, it can‚Äôt edit the message
so it probs broke
just delete the message
I had to delete a queue
And now it won‚Äôt let me re set one up
Any idea why?
alwasy check <#992610856904957992> first
Cheers bro
First timer
all good
Is there a way to make a ‚Äúrole specific‚Äù leaderboard within a queue?
The leaderboard only shows the people with a particular role
These don't go away as well ü§î
if you open the channel, does it actually load?
i‚Äôve noticed on mobile sometimes deleted channels still show but don‚Äôt load
yea it‚Äôs a discord ui bug
you can‚Äôt even delete them if you try i believe
Nope
They go away I think after a day
can probs restart your discord as well
Appreciate the clarity and restart?
Idk how to do that
close the app and reopen
Ohh lmao
might need to force quit idk
you can do /rolerequirement
That works for leaderboards too?
That's Neat
yea it will only show people with the role on the leaderboard
So I 
/Link
Then put that?
Is there a way to make a ongoing leaderboard but make weekly MMR resets like the monthly reset??
Two that run at same time
no there‚Äôs not
<@145305657237700608> just monthly resets??
yea, monthly is the only way to do it automatically
you can manually do weekly resets though
We would have to just record prior stats if we wanted have life time leader board?
yea, there won‚Äôt be an easy way to just flip back to old stats on the leaderboard
Hello
Im trying to purchase but its never working
Do you maybe know why
Whats the issue
Cant purchase credits
But where is the error
It doesnt load?
Or wat
Just shoots me back
no error nothing
no coins
no saying failed or successful
So u bought them or tried and its giving the error
Even if u refresh the neatq page
Nothing
i tried 5 times, everytime i click pay now it just loads back to the credits screen, nothing else happens
any tips?
No idea, could be related to stripe but i dont think so
wtf, i just clicked it when it said 0 credits, it went green and said i had 27 credits?
Then refreshed now i have 0 credits with a red X
You here to assist
The red X means you dont have a plan bought
okay but why did it turn green and say i had 27 credits left
can i get some dev help please lol
Oh wait, how many servers do you own? Or how many servers appear in your dashboard?
wdym
did you get to the stripe checkout page?
Did he probably bought credits for one server and its looking in another one?, maybe thats why he saw credits on one? idk
i tried about 5 times, but it sends me back to the credits page, no other message
im on chrome
the server‚Äôs credits didn‚Äôt go up?
Meta Masters?
At what time is the month updated monthly? Gmt time
default timezone is eastern
can change with /timezone
Okay, so what should i do
what does that mean
what server
Meta masters
have you tried logging out and back in?
or a different browser
ill try
Didnt work
it‚Äôs just showing 0 credits?
i tried buying again
Is there a way to have the queue select operator roles from a list?
you are probably getting charged each time
i‚Äôll refund them now, i can‚Äôt investigate further until tomorrow
what lmao,, no email nothing lol
okay, leave me 30 credits
turn it on for me
Wdym?
Select a random "thing" ? Or what
yeah, for example the players after the map bans/picks, they choose operator from a list we create?
But the operator is just one for the overall game? Or do you mean each player will select an operator
each player has to select their operator
If u mean every player will select an operator, that will be needed before the game starts, in the queue, you can do `/roles`, so whenever someone joins the queue they will need to choose an operator
yeah we tried that, but there are more operator options than player spots
5 players but there is 10 operator options
5 players each team?
Yeah
But when we create the 10 role options it makes the queue have 20 slots
2 of each role, is there any way to have it as an optional choice?
Similar to how they select the maps from a pool
status shows on
queue on my end not wokring
just updated
i made 2 payments on 2 different cards and the credits arent reflecing on my account is there any way i can check if the payment went through
don‚Äôt make any more payments, seems there is an issue with the website displaying credits
sounds good will they reflect when there is a fix?
In /roles you have the optional option
i assume it‚Äôs showing 0 credits for you as well?
no i had 6 credits left over and i tried to make 2 purchases of 30
no still at 6
yes but it update the size of the queue for the ammount of roles
shoulda have 66
yea i‚Äôll take a look tomorrow and see
<@145305657237700608> is there a way i can show payment charge and can just add a premium plan to a server for me?
i can see the charge
i can‚Äôt manually do anything right now
ah ok
all good
if you try and use the credits, does it work?
i jsut did
it worked
did it update the credits display?
i have 49 now
strange
ok good to know
if you need the credits, you can try using them as well
display might just be wrong
where can i go with help with setup for tomorrow?
Just setup the bot in my server. Members who joined the queue from PC complained they couldn't use activity to talk, it automatically set them to push to talk.
How?
Thats impossible
Thats user's setting
unless you mean the priority speaker perm
if the category has that set
what setup?
Ah ye
So when the queue starts, it creates the temp VCs. Are those automatically synced to the category?
Category settings affects everything thats in it
Perfect. Got it fixed. Thanks!
For the queue bot. is there a video i can follow
Check channel topic
Theres a basic guide
Link me the channel, i dont see it
Are u on phone
<#915810764277817354> to get it like this?
Just look up
In this channel
The top of the channel
o lmao
How do I get map picks to work? I added the maps and modes. I added voting, and I added bans. But every time I start a Que it never shows the map selecting part just jumps straight to who won and who‚Äôs lost selection.
Does it show the Map that was selected in the match details that it shows
Is that once the match is finished it shows the details?
It shows 2 messages
This is all I see after a match
Its not after the match
Its on the queue channel
Do `/config save` and send the code here to make this easier
it just asked me to name it
Just click enter it will make a random one
GIERR
Yeah i dont see any maps
How did u add them
/mapp add
Did it pop up something like "You added X map"
Message
Then u didnt add them properly
nvm it did pop up with a message
Thats weird
Do /map add again, and do /info, then go to page 4 and see if any maps are shown
okay it shows a map i just added but i added like 8 diffrent maps with diffrent modes yesterday. and those dont show.
U must changed queues, added in another queue?
Thats weird
Changed queue name?
yeah i had 2 q names i tried them both and both didnt have any maps.
so maybe i only added those maps for 1 que and it disapeard? cause i dont think i saved the maps under any que names if thats even a option
Is there a way to fix this? There are literally 0 people in queue right now but it shows 64. Same for when theres hundreds in game, it shows 64 more than true
happy new year btw
It probably can be bugging out
<:hmm:1172617247320195123>
Why does it keep saying image url doesnt work, which site can i use for this to work?
You can try an img url generator
I used imgur
I tried imgur before and it didnt seem to work
https://imgbb.com/
This one worked for me
still doesnt work for me
nvm got it
had to click it
<@145305657237700608> How do i reset the MMR for everyone?
`/managestats reset all`
Happy New Year <@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> <@857633321064595466>! üî•
Thanks for all yall‚Äôs help!
Also Neatz the leaderboard role requirement didn't work ü§î
you might have more role requirements
iirc everyone is a default required role
Hi, how to make the voice channels that are created, displayed at the bottom of the discord instead of in the category?
U cant
Well, theres an option that it creates a new category each game, that will make it always go bottom, but its better to set a category where the chsnnels should be created
how can i set the category for the voice channels to go in to?
`/channel category`
how do you make the bot aautomatically pick teams baased on the most baalanced possible teams
change your /teamselection
Balanced is in terms of fairest MMR teams
How can I get the staff role to be able to see the queue channel?
Once the lobby has started
they should be given perms
What perms do they need?
like the bot would give them perms to the channel when it‚Äôs created
Is it possible to transfer leaderboard stats from one server to the next?
Dont think so
i can manually do it
It did not adjust with the role changes <@145305657237700608>
Also I changed it on the leaderboard page. And it affected the actual queue as well
yea cuz it‚Äôs linked
wdym it didn‚Äôt adjust
I was wondering if there's a way to make a leaderboard that only had a certain role on it
Even if it's within a specific queue
yea with the role requirements
it will only shows players with one of the roles
It didn't do that when I tried to do that is what I'm saying
And that specific queue allows more than just that role
i would need to see an example
I'll type it then I'll show it -

Queue Z allows players with roles ABC
Leaderboard X only wants players with role A to show up on it even if they're in queue Z which we are pulling their stats from
you would need to link to a queue which only allows for role A players then
Sorry I was working but ahh. I understand.
Is there a way to see the individual growth of specific people month to month?
like new players?
New is good but all players
Is there a place to see the difference month to month
The bot is actually out?
bot is off
How do you configure the bot to where can select more then 1 map (Bo3)?
`/bestof`
How do I create a second Que with a separate leader board?
just create a new queue but dont name it the same
We kept getting rate limit issues not sure if this is because of how many games are being played but we paid for the unlimited
We do got most daily games played but just figured it was a bug?
which message are you seeing?
Unable to create channels due to rate limit. Please try again later!
?
<@145305657237700608>
That‚Äôs the same message I was seeing earlier I think it was because bot was down
that message just kinda happens sometimes
discord won‚Äôt let the bot create a channel for some reason
i‚Äôm not sure what the rate limit is
Okay sounds good
yea there is a different message if you run out of games
Can i run the same que on 3 different channels for better matchmaking
so seperate players based on mmr can only view certain ques but all matches go to the same leaderboard
Is there any other way the que would just not piar them if they are higher mmr or do i gotta create roles for this to be done
Im having a hard time setting it up that way
No, it doesnt matter, higher mmr will match higher
If they enter into the mmr range
`/matchmaking leniency` you can tweak these
`/matchmaking range`
Oh nice!!! that makes it easier
is there a way to make que bigger?
right now i have it at two becasue its only two teams
` /teamsize`
Does that change how many players need to be on a team?
its a card game so its 1v1 but want the match making to be more diversed
in the matchmaking type, there is no limit for the queue size
even if its 1v1, you could have 20 people in queue
okay dope im tweaking the leniency command whats a good value for this
depends on what your MMR system looks like
what MMR are people
and whats the gain/loss
i just changed it to 20 idk if that was a bad thing or good thing but everything is honestly at default i didnt do much change to the bot
i would just think about it in examples
if you have a 1500 MMR player, how long would you want them to wait in queue to play a 1000
if the range is set to 500, and the leniency is 15, they would wait for 500 seconds (if my math is not wrong)
What's the way to make it where only some people at a certain skill can queue with others at a certain skill?
For example 
Rank 1 can only queue with people up to Rank 25. And Rank 2 can queue with up to 26.
Is that possible?
Found it‚ÄîMM Range‚Ä¶ let me ask how is it dictated
Like first person in? Or does it accomadate the highest and lowest person in the range
people who have been in the queue longer will be favored, but overall itll just create the first match within the threshold it finds
how do i make it so where the 2-8 place roles auto change when they get those places in mmr
we dont have a set mmr for those places since mmr constantly changes
<@145305657237700608> The matches/server_id endpoint still returns an empty list üò¶

Any ETA?
Question, Is there a way to see the individual growth of specific people month to month? There own progression?
But entire month
hi how can i pop the names in the matchmaking queue not the full team
<@145305657237700608>
`/anonymousqueue`
Theres a progress graph in `/stats`, but theres no another way to visualize the growth
hm im seeing data from that endpoint
Do we not get data if mmr stats were reset? 

I tried before resetting as well, lemme simulate a game and check again and let you know.
hmm no the history isnt ever deleted
its just for your own testing purposes
you can unban yourself with `/player unban`
youll see a message like this in the match channel
after teams are set up
did you load a config?
thats controlled by this command `/timer winnervotemessage`
you can have multiple matches start from the same queue
make sure you have `/tempchannels toggle mode:Enabled`
but then you can just rejoin queue
thanks
We keep getting this and when players are joining the first VC it doesn‚Äôt separate them to start match
Doesn‚Äôt look like bot is down either
We do got 45 matches being ran right now
what server?
RankedSimLeague
We just locked the Que for now for a cool down we were having a lot of issues arising
hmm seems like its all backed up
you can give it another shot, looks like the channel creation queue is empty now
Okay cool
If we boost server does that help? <@145305657237700608>
i dont think so
Damn yeah we opened Que up and it just happened again
anything I can do? or just keep it in cool down for time being till some people come out of channels? any way I can pay more to increase bot capacity
its not something im doing, discord isnt letting the bot create any channels in your server
Ahhh okay I see
im not sure why right now, the server isnt doing anything crazy it seems
i guess 370 games in the past 2.5 hours is a lot
Does players leaving channels clear up space
im not sure, i wouldnt think its related
If we took away vc would that work?
Essentially they don‚Äôt need to be in vc
Just a text channel
is it creating text channels?
Text and voice
But we don‚Äôt need voice
Just text
like, is it working and creating text channels
Let me test
It does
But when it reaches limit
It starts acting weird but I think it‚Äôs because we hit 500 channel limit
If there was a way to get rid of the voice channels or even where it kicks you into two voice channels I think that would help out a lot
you could try `/tempchannels type type:Threads`
Okay
but yea, you could disable voice channels as well
How I disable them
`/voicechannels mode`
but yea, the 500 channel limit is a hard cap, so definitely dont wanna hit that
When I disable voice channels they don‚Äôt get timeouts or anything it‚Äôs just text channel with reporting correct?
yea it just skips the voice channel stuff
<@145305657237700608>  the reporting doesn‚Äôt pop up on the text channel anymore will it now populate in match results?
wdym
I think those were old channels
hey how can iadd neat que to my discord
https://top.gg/bot/857633321064595466
click invite
or go to the sidebar here in discord, click the neatqueue bot and "Add app"
ya i just dk how to make the channels and stuff
oh i see
heres a basic guide for setup
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
is there any way to make it so players can't cancel?
you could hide the command
in the server integration settings
same with all staff commands
how do I do that?
we keep having too many cancels so I want to trial hiding it
you should be able to modify the perms for the /cancel command
perfect, you're the man
Do I hide it by just doing that?
i think so
okay cool cool
you can probs impersonate the default role and check
actually you might need to deny the role instead
instead of granting access, since everyone has access by default
we pray for the first day of bot stability in a while <:Prayge:848738134786572348>
ooooo dont jinx it
its been good
ye ram usage been sticking around 60%
that's awesome
hey. how is MMR change calculated? any reason there is such difference in numbers?
and is there any way to alter MMR changes other than make it static?
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=mmr-change
depends on player mmr, team mmr, enemy team mmr, placement match multipliers, and streak multipliers
<@145305657237700608> Hey, how can i make it so it dms me after the match is complete the results and current elo, i want to make 1 person reporting but its a pain to see if the other person reported correctly, anyway to make turn dms on for after match reports
Theres no option for that
You can set a `/staffchannel set` that will work in your server
But theres no dm option
When i have it on 1 person reports what a good solution for no knowing what was reported?
Hmm what do you mean?
Reporting what
if i use 1 person reporting
The guy reports he lost right
How does the winner find out who won or lost without a dm?
You def have to make it so it dms you updated stats and the results of last game right
Theres a win and lose message in the queue channel
And also a result report by default
Im pretty sure the que channel just deletes
How would someone not know that they won if they are playing the game?
Because people false report matches
In the queue channel, it sends the result
so they have to make sure
Which queue channel, the one they get put in?
like room 87?
The channel where they press Join Queue
Do i have to turn that on or something
You can change the channel by `/resultschannel`
It should be enabled by default
Ah, it send the results, yes but they would have to go to that channel and scroll throught the results and stuff
Thats why u can change the channel where the results go in
I have a channel, its called results channel, they all go there
Yeah, theres no way to dm people the result of the queue
Okay, add it to the list.
Ill suffer for now
want to make 1 click voting as clean as possible. dont want them hunting throught past matches since we might have a lot going and reporting at the same time
Did u turn off the vote for everyone and just the staff can report the match?
What do you mean?
People dont vote for the team that won?,
No, the winner or the loser can report, we require 1 vote for the match to be concluded however it becomes annoying to see if the results were reported correctly every single time by searching the past matches channel
Why would u make 1 vote
because 2 votes people dont report and afk
I just ban the false reporters instead of banning the lazy people
How many is the teamsize
1 v 1
Ah i see
Well, the best option would be setting a /staffchannel
I have it
oh ok
I revert and cancel the games if an issue comes
I was just asking for a way for them to get an alert after someone reports something
it just closes the channel, nothing else happens
Its missing something for the person who didnt report anything, he is left in the dark at that point
<@648635725964902411> i have a question, how can i put the settings to where people gain more elo than they lose?
`/mmr change set`
okay, so here i would make the 1st one 50 and the 2nd one lets say 40?
Is it possible to have the same queue in 2 different discords?
`/config save` and `/config load`
But these obv wont share nothing, since its different servers
No, i mean 1 person queues from 1 discord, the other person queues from the other?
ah okay
no thats not supported
Well, that would be a pretty impressive support lol
it would be cool, but unfortunately would involve a large amount of work
For the Voice Channels what does after teams created do?
Hello our bot does not show the buttons to select winner
<@145305657237700608>
In Game counter showing 384 people when there are literally 8 people in one queue üòÇ
We have autoroles set, and that's working great.  The first photo attached is an example showing the division a player has been placed in.
One issue that we're having is that when the bot updates their role, it changes their nicknames back to their Discord name instead of keeping the nickname.
Is there a setting that has accidentally been turned on or missed, or is this the default?
I appreciate it!
thats the default option where the team voice channels are created after the teams are made
yea its definitely messed up, i can see some old games still being used in counting
autoroles doesn't change nicknames, the only time that happens would be from `/ratinginname` i believe
Thanks for the feedback!
but also still, it shouldnt be reverting the name or something
maybe they just changed their name?
Due to unfortunate abuse of it in the past, we have it set to where they can't change their own name. I just thought of a setting on another bot that I have in there. I'll test it then get back to you.
i think you should be able to check the audit log to see what/who changed that persons name
I've found the issue. I have a nickname bot that changes the suffix of their name depending on which of these roles they have.
It was set for Discord name rather than username. I should've thought to check that one first. My bad
nice, no worries!
I would have thought the full reset on the 1st would fix it but I guess not
nah it just counts all the current games
"current"
there are some which have been finished, but arent deleted on my end
i should have a fix to prevent games from getting stuck like that
hello, how can i setup separate mmr for different queues ?
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> 

How do i lock the voice channels like BPL?
So it prevents people to join that channel?
`/channel restrictions`
Hi, if i change the queue name, will the previous stats be lost?
New queue wont have the stats
The stats will be still attached to the old queue namr
Is there a way to transfer them to the new queue name?
<@648635725964902411>
/`managestats move`
Thanks
<@648635725964902411> whats the max amount of games that can run at the same time?
Unlimited by the bot part, by discord part you can have only 500 channels
Really, so there cant be 501 matches?
if you disable creating voice channels and use threads, you should be able to have 1000 matches at the same time
okay sick
but yea, the hard limit of 500 channels for a server kinda limit how many matches you can normally have running
<@145305657237700608> does it make sense for it to take long for the photo to change ?
what photo?
Nvm, it worked, just took a few mins
<@145305657237700608> you‚Äôre the goat
Stability has been amazing so far
been such a relief lmao
Ohh dude I can imagine
wait true i didnt even notice
been 2 days already
Is there any way to bypass the **ADMIN ONLY** for some of the commands? We would like to give our mods the ability to fix MMR if the need ever arises, but we don't want to make them admins.
its not server admin, its staff role
just make the mod role a staff role via the bot
Sadly I think it just went down
bot down again
lol <@298339106847457290> ...
https://tenor.com/view/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-ah-shit-cj-gta-gta-san-andreas-gif-13933485
Awesome. So looking like this should be good?
yup thats it
<a:Dance_Dood_Rave:998965405420892231>
might not go through if youre on node 1 tho
It won't, but I'm patient
wait whats up?
application not responding across all servers
but its back
rip, i see
damn you guys jinxed me this time <a:Crying:905162032460992533>
`/staffrole add`
oh chandler already did
I have done /channel restrictions and people are able to join the channel
I see the channel lock
Ppl who are not in q shouldnt be joining
is there a way to not allow a certain role not to play?
Thats what i thought
`/bannedroles add `
But it's 5  players in the voice channel
ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It can be your category settings
Can u send me your `/config save`
<@648635725964902411>
Do you have staffrole or spec role
hello, how do i add mmr?
manually with `/add mmr` or `/set mmr`
give people mmr sorry
With those commands aswell
How can i reset everyones mmr
so i have a few questions.

1. how do i have the bot auto move players when queue is full to the queue VC and then separate team VCs once voting is done?

2. How do I let the chosen captains draft their players

3. How do I for CoD allow captains to vote on maps foR THe series? (I've alreaded added maps and game modes)

4. How can i add an MMR leaderboard in a text channel?

5. Is there any way to test all of this out when im done editing everything without needing more than myself?
`/managestats reset mmr`
`/lobby channel set`, `/teamselection`, `/map voting`, `/leadearboard` and `/test`
wdym?
hey <@145305657237700608> not sure why we getting this
one of the BPL servers
If the bot is giving everyone a long ban when the quota isn't met, how do I change the duration?
Did u check if it ran out of premium
Would that not then affect every BPL server
let me check with Mac
`/player autoban`
If they bought if different days, no
Premium is not global
Is server specific
yeah Helix just ask Austin he'll know
Thanks guys he sorted it out I thought premium was global <:PeepoHeart:1171269076971180042>
<:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
<#910981294937210930>
5 minutes
BONK
<:LieMeter:1192518799468019952>
let me see if i can speed it up
it no work plz fix
wait nvr,
No. But people still go in the vocie channel of the queues
Really need to lock the voice channels
i have done channel restrictions and still open
whats the channel ID?
1181361078777675876
on our server
i've dm you
so you have a staff role, which is why there is no channel lock
After update, change something in leaderboard i have this message
yea something broke with leaderboards, gonna hotfix in a few mins
So you suggest to remove staff role?
yea in the Matchmaking queue type, there's no limit to how many people can join
if it says 0/2, that would not be matchmaking, so those matchmaking commands wont be doing anything
you dont need to
im a bit behind on what the issue is sorry
im just saying if you have a staff role, the channel wont have a user limit
by default, other players are still prevented from joining
yup just `/queuetype`
awesome, thanks, ill test it now
Hi, is there a way to have the bot post auto Queue bans anywhere?
no thats not supported
after captains are selected, how do i force game modes during voting? So like first vote should be hard point map then snd map and then control map, but the first vote that popped up was ‚Äúvote the gamemode‚Äù so how do i force input game modes to be auto chosen
Sent you a dm
`/gamemode selection gamemode_choice:Ordered`
says application did not respond
seems there is a bug
either you dont have any maps, or some map doesnt have a gamemode
check your /info and see
Is there a way when someone ‚Äúcancels‚Äù the match/queue that they will have priority in the subsequent queue after they go back to the lobby?
Can it boot out people in the queue that's currently maybe 4/8 if the lobby that was just canceled was a 7/8 for example
got it thanks. one map was missing a mode
currently cancelling a match gives no priority or auto requeue
i think it might not be a great idea since people would be incentivized to cancel for new players
also if cancel requeued everyone, it would recreate the same match
if i have the average gain mmr at 50 for winners and average lost mmr for losers also at 50, does it stick 50 24/7 or will it change depending on players mmr that you beat or lost to?
it will be dynamic by default
last thing and i think im all set

can anybody edit things using the commands? or only me as i invited the bot? if so how do i change these settings?
its only staff
Do i use /setup again in another text channel to start a whole other queue for something else?
either /setup, or /config load, or /startqueue
use /config load if you want the same settings
/config save to get the config
whats the command to give a role admin perms
`/staffrole`
anyway to get previous lists of what roles give what MMRs?
say diamond 1 has an mmr of 30, Diamond 2 has 33. is there anywhere that i can find those specific numbers?
`/info`
How do i take the voting out in queue results? i dont want the results popping up until after the winner is voted
Is it possible to disable MMR and just have games/wins/losses?
Hey guys! so I'm organizing a tournament and need to report set outcomes to the bot. Previously, I used a different app and now want to know the best way to input wins for each player per set so I can use the stats for leaderboard and other slash commands. Is there an active slash command for reporting sets? Like something similar to "/gamereport Player1 1 - 0 Player2"?
wdym? the winner has to be selected before it can be shown
you can set the `/mmr change set` to 0
Thank you
every match is either a win or loss, theres no way to report results more accurately
once teams were formed it pops up in queue results and can also select winner from there.
word! thank you

also I currently have two active queues, but when I use "/stats," it only shows results from one queue instead of displaying the combined win/loss stats from both queues (2/2). Is there a way to manually configure this to show the combined stats for both queues?
if the two active queues dont have the same name it wont share stats between them

Sorry for another question but I've looked through the documentation and I couldn't seem to find an answer. - Is it possible to manually edit the stats of players so I can implement previous stats that were tracked elsewhere?
do `/add` n youll see the options
or /set
Thank you! Appreciate it, exactly what I am looking for
There's probably a bunch of posts that i cant find about this but is there a certain authorization level in a server i need to be to run /setup? i just get `Starting Queue Setup!` as a mod and doesnt show up the setup commands as expected
make sure the bot has perms to send messages in that channel
no dice üò¶ we gave permissions and not working still, unless i should be assigning the bot itself permissions and not a role it has
it probably shouldn‚Äôt matter but if there are no messages popping up, that‚Äôs the only reason
i got it, looks like it needed to be given permissions for the bot itself and not the role
thats a bit weird but it works now!
<:Shrug:1171270284670668830>
got it working though thank you!
<@648635725964902411> Can I ask what hero's are used for? There is a command to add heroes, ban heroes etc. What does that do?
it‚Äôs for adding hero bans
for games like League, Overwatch, etc
Okay üôÇ Thank you! I am trying to set up that the player chooses the deck they are going to play before they enter que. Is this possible?
no there‚Äôs no functionality like that
at least not right now, im thinking of a way to add custom steps before entering queue though
That would be awesome! It would be kool if they could choose their deck they are playing and then that stat is shown in their stats. So they can see they have an 80% win rate for x deck and 55% win rate with y deck etc.
that‚Äôs something that would likely be out of scope since it‚Äôs very specific to certain games
thank you! very helpful
also... is there a way to remove the cooldown for mods trying to view stats w/ /stats
unfortunately not, it‚Äôs one of the more intensive things the bot has to deal with
Hi, I was testing out features on a private discord and voted for the server with my own account to unlock leaderboards and such, and now I have switched over to the main discord. Since there is a 12 hr restriction in voting for my account, I had someone else in the discord vote for NeatQueue on top.gg to unlock the leaderboard system but for some reason it's still locked and I am unable to use the feature. Any advice?
i can manually override one  sec
should be good
Yeah, I just tested it now, the restriction is lifted - thank you
hey, it's been a while, just checking in to see if this was implemented. didn't see anything about it in <#954499196629692486> or <#910981294937210930> so thought I'd check in
Are you able to make this so players, once the queue has started, can choose the hero they want to play with from a list?
yup should be good
How can i reset the player stats in the queue without reseting the queue itself?
`/managestats reset`
Thanks
I have a question about predictions.

I understand that they're based on points, but is there a way to bet your mmr?
no thats not possible
that would be kinda strange imo lol
We have some stranger players, tbf lol. I appreciate the feedback
```/managestats reset all?```
How i type it, it asks for a user
Yes that command
`/managestats reset player` will target one person
reset all is for all players that have stats in that queue
You can only reset mmr if u want to
Thanks.
is the vc queue entry up? command isnt showing up for me yet
nah, will update in a bit, been busy with work
all good, just got the DM about it and wanted to test it. thanks!
Is there a way to use the hero command to give the players an option to choose their hero from a list in the queue lobby?
Is a hero a character?
yeah like league or r6
You can do it with /roles
how though? we want the players to be able to choose their hero/operator from a list after the queue has started
thats not possible currently
hey, i'm wondering what exactly is globalqueue? is it for matchmaking across servers? or just syncing stats?
only for stats across servers
i see
is there a feature for cross server matchmaking?
unfortunately no
alrighty, ty for the answers
oh, also! is there a way for tempchannels as thread to be locked instead of deleted when the game ends?
hmm no, i figure it should clean up the thread to prevent it from getting crowded?
yea, that's true, but if any issues come up, it's useful to have the chat still available for mods
check out https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/910981294937210930/1184542238039097384
ah, i see!
didn't know about that one, ty again
hey guys quick question. im in test mode rn, but every time join queue, i am pinged twice opposed to just once. any insight on how i can change this?
its pings all the players
so it simulates that you are all the players
no i get that, the pic above is a 1v1 queue, and I figured I would only be pinged twice opposed to 4 times since I am the only one in there
r u sure its 1v1
but you cant change to ping once in test mode basically
yea im pretty sure
word i just want it so it pings once per player
not twice
it will, its just the test mode
i see i see
so this usually stops once test mode is off>
yeah, idk why it pinged u 4 times
maybe you have this enabled? `/misc mention teamscreated toggle:`
if not, `/config save` so i can check it out, could be a bug
this was it!
thank you bro
anyway to get the pictures back on my queue when the subscription goes away?
i lost my edits üò¶
errrrr do you have a recent config?
i did
i used it
didnt populate
whats the way to change it manually
did you have premium active?
otherwise it wont load premium stuff
I do now
and i did
but it ended like 20 min ago
didnt realize it would be gone :/
if the config had the images and stuff, if you load it while premium is active they should be loaded as well
if u give me the code i can check
I manually did it
Already lol but I can try one I didn‚Äôt fix
the queue enter vc channel keeps generating additional (2-3) vcs to join to determine if anyone is "inactive"
could you screenshot or take a video to explain?
that is just sitting in the channel for 20 seconds
do i need to make a command to drag everyone again to their vc?
i guess it‚Äôs bugged when you don‚Äôt have tempchannels enabled
since when the match starts, it probably drags you into the queue voice, which makes you leave the queue
either enable /tempchannels toggle, or disable the voice channel queuing
but i‚Äôll fix it tomorrow
i accidentally deleted a queue can i somehow bring that queue back or do i have to go throught the setup process again
`/config list ` and `/config load`
how do u make it so if people dont vote who wins, u can end the queue yourself, by voting who wins
as the admin, and finish the queue
`/outcome`
its saying the team number is wrong?
expects a number, so either team 1 or 2
Chaos is team 2
set up a `/staffchannel`, its easier
for future games
Yeah figured that out
Thanks
before i suggest it imma ask if its already a thing 

Say per example player A goes on a 10x win streak can a bonus be added like say 30 points?
thinking of ways to reward players for win streaks etc
@ me with response please
Hello got a problem here most of the time (99%) i can only see numbers and not the names what can i do
Its discord bugs
F***
Sorry thanks for the awnser
Hello, how do you reset the leaderboard?
I kicked the bot from the server, added it back, but the leaderboard has still not reset
`/managestats reset`
What ended up working was ‚Äú/managestats reset player‚Äù
that resets a single player, not a whole leaderboard
not sure if there is a fix or workaround (or just dumb on our part), but while using the vc queue entry, someone joined by accident and tried to leave the match, and the same issue happened with the duplicative temp queue channels

should the solution be to /cancel or /endqueue everytime this happens?
whats ur config?
and it would be /cancel
NPONH
and sometimes dragging or ppl joining the queue via vc does not register for some reason. keeps it at 3/4
Is there a way to disable all these buttons?
I want to disable the option to Enable/Disable MMR.
/mmr change allow_disable
Thank you
How about disable the team selection type?
wdym?
I don‚Äôt want these buttons
Because for my queues
It‚Äôs 1v1s
So not necessary
do /teamselection and select balanced
Thank you
Okay last thing
Is there a way to cancel a match if one of the parties is unresponsive?
/cancel or /outcome cancel
Thank you
How to reset MMR on the server?
issue is still happening with the entry queue vc
I need help
how do I make the bot know it‚Äôs a best of 3 and it picks 3 maps not just one
`/bestof`
thank you
how do I make the bot think it‚Äôs HP SND and Control
and how do I show stats and stuff
Why is /cancel not working? thanks
<@145305657237700608> Hey, if a players elo keeps reseting what can i do?
thats not how a command is used in discord
when is it resetting?
Hey <@145305657237700608> with the elo, if there is a Bo3 is there a difference in elo gained if the team wins 2-0 compared to 2-1?
Not really
Its just like more matches to win, but still the same mmr win
okay thanks
is there a way i can make the bot automatically sub someone from the queue if the queue is missing someone that didnt join the created channel
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/910981294937210930/1192708630118670448
hello
Where's the premium option for the bot? I don't see it on the website
<@145305657237700608>
ah okay so how do i make it so players can have option to cancel match? thanks
Log in the website
and go to dashboard
the command is /cancel, but use it as a discord command
<@648635725964902411>
How many daily matches do we have
as no premium user
hey guys, we have a queue, where it put a group of people into a queue, but the bot bugged and just didnt work
Be more specific
genuinly didnt have the bot to start with
yea that‚Äôs weird
think its resolved inself
itself
i‚Äôm testing with your config and not seeing the same issue
it doesnt look like the mmr range is working
i have a 40 gap and it doesnt follow it
hey guys! quick question w the predictions. how do you get points to vote on players in active matches?
are you in matchmaking mode?
also, if your range is 40, that‚Äôs the starting range which expands
so 64 -24?
because it let in a 10 haha
i‚Äôm not sure what you mean
64 joined then a 10 was able to
sure that‚Äôs possible
the matchmaker just tries to create the fairest match possible
depends on your config
nvm its a "PUGs/Normal Individual Queue"
no way to only have a certain level play with a certain level?
range?
also matchmaking does that carry over if i change the queue type from one to another
no, in PUGs, a match starts when it fills up
stats? yes they carry over
i mean all the dits
edits
all the edits, captains, roles etc
maps
oh, yes all queue config stats as well
queue type itself is just a config
question, is there a way to keep the names showing up?
in the MM queue?
how do i change the inactive timer for when queue pings a full queue? its set to 5 and i want to make it shorter
`/lobbychannel timer`
question. I want to manually input wins & losses for a side tournament into the bot. How will manually inputting wins/losses affect whr?
is there anyway of getting it too not join the voice chat too start selecting teams
`/voicechannels mode` optional or disabled
`/add win` or `/add loss`
No I understand the commands. Will using / add affect whr, or will it just add a win to stats, or both
It will just add the win
You can set a /staffchannel where you can manage who won and revert or cancel, or you can also make the voting only available for staff, so u just would select it on the staff channel
ok I gotchu. I have the /staff channel set up. Is there a way to manually change whr w/ a win or loss. Cause /win or /loss won‚Äôt affect whr rank for leaderboard?
Uh the only way is to revert, using the staff channel, or manually removing the mmr and the win
But staff channel should be enough
I wish there was more of a ‚Äú/report‚Äù option where players could report win/loss against other players & affect whr, cause the staff channel only has control over games in-queue, not games that happen out of queue. Would be nice to just report a game in staff channel & have the results have a direct effect on whr
but I get what you‚Äôre saying this will only change user wins, but not whr
i‚Äôm not following
the staff channel shows every game?
Staffchannel has control over any game
Even if is finished
But staffchannel can‚Äôt help me with games I want to report myself, separate from queue, but I want stats from my side tourney included in queue
gotcha
Oh ic ic
Yea honestly I‚Äôd love this feature almost as much as the queue itself because it provides a lot of flexibility for the user, and my /add win won‚Äôt have any impact on the leaderboard rankings :/ cause whr is unaffected
you would have to add MMR as well
I believe there's 3 queues going on in my server right now, only one of which is actually used. How do I see how many queues there technically are and what their names are?
ok ok gotcha i wish the bot just did this for me üòÇ  but its doable manually forsure
the /add commands are more for low level fixing stuff, not for simulating an entire match
`/serverstats info`
should show i think
I've got these three then I think, but those "matches" is definitely not correct as there is someone with 60+ games
Is there a way I can make one of the old ones active?
So I can see if there actually was any games played in them
whats the server ID?
Even up to here there is someone who has played more than 64
1153294922552717404
what are you looking for exactly?
I knew there was 3 different queues with such similar names, I want to know if there's any games that actually got played under the other two
and if not, how i can remove them
it shows there was games played, no?
Yeah but the numbers dont add up so surely is not right?
and if so, how do i get the leaderboards up for those two queues
that i no longer use
i think it wont count games cancelled in the "Queues" section
you can use `/leaderboard` to view other queue names
or rename your queue and check the LB
The first one says this, but on the /serverstats info, it says 2 matches
How do I now delete that queue? is that possible?
you can delete stats with `/managestats reset`
it doesnt matter if you just keep it though
I guess
how do i rename it
Also I want to make a new queue for 2024. Will that carry over all the settings i have put in currently, for example the dragging and the team names settings?
Or would it be more wise to take screenshots of my current leaderboard and then wipe it?
if you name the queue the same, it will share the same stats
if you create a new queue, you would need to use the same config to keep the same queue setup
I was planning on naming it like "queue 2024"
But that's fine, I guess the only question I have left is what command can I use to rename a queue and what command is it to wipe the stats of a current one
you can rename with `/queuename`
renaming a queue will basically reset the stats
you  wont see any old stats
the ability to sim an entire match would be perfect lmaooo need the whr to be pinpoint
Hi, <@145305657237700608> with the roles it can have more than 2/2 for a role as it displays 2/2 +1. Is there a way to stop people choosing the role once its filled?
not currently
Can that be added?
my opp
did not submit
the resuls what do i do?
i cant help, you need to talk to your server staff
It currently adds them to the next queue right?
is server staff the admirables?
i dont know your server
hi, how can i check daily stats for a specific server not displayed in <#935731235790139422>
did not mean this lol
server stats info command is not showing me the daily stats im looking for
bot seems off
Is there an update rn? Getting the not responding
yep bot is offline in my channel
unlucky, itll restart in a sec
im working on a change as well which will let the bot pick right back up with game setups
back on
instead of having to requeue and find a new match
Is not down?
Any way on this update to make it where matchmaking Range works in PUGs individual queue as well? Just enable and or disable it.
Is there a way to clear the wins/losses/players/mmr without losing config (changing the name of it)?
I've done some noting of the old one and just want to wipe the slate clean without having to re set-up all my configurations
Is that possible?
no, that wouldnt really make sense
since it starts a match when the queue fills
`/managestats reset`
Or at least make it to where it shows the people joining in the queue in the matchmaking version?
It looks so dull compared to names filling up the queue
Just being honest üòÖ
disable `/anonymousqueue`
Thank GOD
Thank youüôèüèº
Y‚Äôall have thought of everything
And probably have heard everything too
99% of the features were requested by people
so yea pretty much
Love it üëç
Any work on making the thumbnails bigger?
For the Premium users?
Wish the thumbnail would POP more
Or at least have the option to
the top right one?
I'm having a massive brain fart right now.

Back when we started the queues, this is how the points changed. It was different for every player.
Now, all the points are the same, and I can't figure out how to change it back to the way it was. Sunday brain is down bad.
you have `static: true` in /mmr change set
NeatZ, i think one of my issues was when the match concluded, we returned all players to previous channel, which was the queue vc, then a person would leave and would start the iterations of channels. 

probably the same issue when someone clicks ‚Äúleave queue‚Äù but is still in the channel, duh. i‚Äôll create it again and see if anything comes up. i‚Äôll see if i can mess with commands to resolve before putting it here

thx again
That's it! Thank you
yo how do i delete the "leave queue" button?
<:PeepoHeart:1171269076971180042>
you cant
`can i put a timer on it?
like whenever u join queue
u need to wait set seconds
no, i dont think so
when using the vc to join queue, and someone hits leaves match, the queue vc that is generated stays fixed. it isnt a temp channel
is your lobby channel the queue channel?
for this i just diasbled return all to previous channel and made the before/after to my General VC
yea i guess if it returns everyone into the lobby channel, that would make them join queue as well
is there a reason for a specific player to not register as ‚Äúin the queue‚Äù when joining queue entry vc and also not having permission to run / commands when they are a staff member in the server
Is there anyway to pin the prediction command so it can be accessed by anyone?n
Hey guys
How come it‚Äôs not giving an option to vote on the winner anymore?
This for example is not popping up anymore
Hey guys last question for a while. so I have 2 active queues named the same thing, but when players enter the two queues, it shows that two sets of mmr are being recorded. how do i ensure all stats go to the same leaderboard?
Stats will be the same in both queues
one is bo3 and one is bo5. would that be the issue? they are named the same
Do you have the leadeaboard?
no but i have the score reporting mmr
i highlighted the mmr change
same name for Q but different stats
https://tenor.com/view/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-ah-shit-cj-gta-gta-san-andreas-gif-13933485
Receiving Interaction failed when trying to vote team winner
should be back now
it was very short
Is the bot down?
<@648635725964902411>
Same here
Node 1 seems offline
https://www.neatqueue.com/status
Its back <:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
Bot still down??
Hmm no
any updates on this btw? no rush but any help would be great
Down right?
looks like it
Node 1 is back
Should be up
why do bots update not pop up in discord?
also can u do a cross que between 2x discord servers?
the Watcher bot doesn't publish messages in announcement channels
i need to set up my own thing
What does this mean?
was hoping 2x discords could have 1 que. could be good. but maybe really complicated and hard to implement.
globalqueue shares stats across servers
there is no multi server queuing
Is there a way that when u que/play a match u get 1 entry into a raffle type thing for a giveaway?
Nope i would say
We still need help to figure this out! Is this because we have more than 2 q sync together? it is working for our '' 1v1 '' and '' 2v2 '' q but since we add another separate one for ''tournament only'', it doesn't sync with the same leaderboard even if we did what's needed! (only difference from the 2 others q is that it's bo5 instead of bo3
So the stats are not sharing, but you want them to?
Had the bot go down a bunch tonight, buttons stop working and stuff
Had to shut down EU for the day
Most of the problems were

- VCs deleted mid match (around 30 times)
- buttons stopped working for drafts
- channels not deleting
- players not getting elo for matches
Seems to be only affecting Node 1 now, which I‚Äôm guessing is what BPL EU and BPL-C are on now
I need help with the MMR range how do I make super static
yes exactly this
yes! work for 2/3 of them
if you check your `/info`, it will show what the stats name is
page 3
they have the same stats name
so if you check leaderboard in each channel, its different?
wdym
the channel are both new, and not many players have reached the 5 game min requirement to get placements, but like in [here](https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/868549627652214794/1193729578754121779) I noticed that the mmr of the same player in the two queues were different when they should be the same
check someones /stats in each channel?
this is the same command /stats w/ the same player in each queue
still getting different stats
what are the channel IDs?
1v1 Queue Channel ID: 1175593288540110928
Tournament Queue Channel ID: 1193588928029130853
ding ding
the tournament queue has monthly stats enabled
ok ok
so i should disable stats in tournament queue?? <:DontLookJr:1059595460819558481>
just disable monthly stats
since the main queue isnt monthly
alright so if i were set all 3 queues as rollover, that should resolve it as well since all 3 queues are the same?
1 queue is bo5 and the other 2 are bo3, i hope this wont affect anything
sure, if all the queues are monthly thatll work
awesome thanks for your help bro ü§ù <a:cheers:1058073497995321344> seriously appreciate it
Hi, does /register for valorant currently work for APAC accounts?
<@145305657237700608> why does the inqueue role i give sometimes stay on when they leave queue, is there a quick way to reset this?
Is there image dimensions we need to follow or?
no, but it needs to be a direct image link
if you post the link in discord, it should convert to an image automatically
seems like no, the API its using is checking NA and EU
ill have to update it
I had to restart a queue and now it‚Äôs now letting players vote for the winning team after the match is finished
How do I add that again?
why cant they vote?
It just doesn‚Äôt appear for some reason
I had to manually give a team the win for the queue before this
whats that channel ID
<@857633321064595466> hey my queue got hit my wick and put in quarintine, now i took it out its not working
That command does not exist!
Just deleted that one but this one has the same issue
1193940792604106812
<@145305657237700608>
you changed the /winnermessage results to Staff Only
so it doesnt show a vote
not a bug
Oh I see
Thanks
I just tried setting up the queue and it‚Äôs not showing the queue
<@145305657237700608>
Check channel perms probably
Does the bot need perms?
It has its own role with the needed perms
But you need to make sure other category or channel perms doesnt override them
Looks like the bot doesnt have "Embed links" perm
or just send messages
<@145305657237700608> can we pay for premium with PayPal?
Not through the website since I use Stripe, not paypal
if you can only use paypal, you can DM me
yo <@145305657237700608>
He can contact you ^^
i will dm you, im practically his boss
yea lets chill üòÑ
doesnt want to do matchmaking
the matchmaking range is 20
how do you know everyone is within the correct range?
range of 20 is super tight
yes though
odds are not everyone it within a 20 mmr range
20-32
need only 8
7, 14, 18, 20, 24, 28, 30, 30, 32
me im 20
the 7 will not be playin
whats the channel ID
https://discord.com/channels/1140190171191582752/1179913683086884964
idk what id or how to find what it is
thats the queue channel?
im not seeing it
https://discord.com/channels/1140190171191582752/1176962315355164742
gotcha now we have 10
1176962315355164742 the id
u are 11 MMR?
no i was 20
i changed it 2x to test
so thats probably what it was
it popped
all g now
is it possible to merge one Leaderboard to the other?
Leadearboard are just the display of the queue's stats
So you will be merging the queue stats
`/managestats merge`
Thank you very much!
anyway to make it where ppl who are in queue currently playing cant join a new queue?
Do you have more than 1 queue?
But, if he is playing a match, he wont be able to join a queue until the match ends
Have u changed the requeue condition?
Are you able to make a queue just playeable for specific role. Since we have a open role which everyone has and then Advanced but the advanced players are always able to see and play in the open-queue
You can do that just by setting the discord permissions of the category or channel the advanced queue is in so that you have to have advanced perms to be able to see it.
if you want it visible to all but not joinable thats different
/rolerequirement add, youll have to remove `everyone` role first with /rolerequirement remove
Alright, perfect thank you!
Hello I have one issue, why can people all of the sudden join the VC from the queues, how can I close them again for only the teams
What commands have you ran on the queue recently?
weve got the same issues
<@349002644662255616>
Oh yes!
<@279004976263725067>
Sounds like bot issue then rather than config per server
Will check mine
Thank you!
its not like it in TGL
damn if i could see your channel perms, if it was a discord set up issue i could probably help there.
Check your dm
jump in a vc ill show you
or that
<@712719326385537035> hes in the Support VC here
come in
I'm helping with the server atm it'll be hard but you can show him and do it!
if u need more help lmk
Thank you, we will do that!!
Issue mentioned above was down to channel and category permissions in the discord server set up that caused the problem.

Hey, why do these keep getting created?
Discord has a limit to how many channels can be created in a day, this was a change that was put in place to stop reaching the channel creation limit as it re-used already created channels when it could, hence why you see reserved.

I do question why you are still seeing this though as i think another change has been made since where i now no longer see these channels, yet you still do.
Hey guys, is there anyway to change the cool down when checking personal stats via the bot? Or is it set by default
No, thats not possible to change
Hello! How do you make the bot post all the results in a channel/
`/resultschannel`
Thank you! I was supposed to link it first. that's why.

Can I ask you one more thing? When you queue? How do I disable the team? When players queue, they have to vote for "balanced" first and I want to take it out so they can go jump into the match immediately since the game we're covering is just 1v1
/teamselection set
Thank you so much <@648635725964902411> !
I'm very sorry but I have to ask one more. I saw a server that uses the bot and it showed the players stats on a channel. I tried using /stats but it only allows me to check one player at a time and it's an admin access. I'm not sure how to do that on a channel
You have a 300 seconds delay per /stats use
So players can use /stats to check theirs right?
/stats, is not an admin command
Any mods available to help me?

 Struggling to change members role based on MMR.

How do you have ur /autoroles?
how do i check?

<@145305657237700608> Is it possible to get the whole history of matches from the server via API?
<@648635725964902411> it‚Äôs empty but I thought I added roles :/
I would say yeah
What‚Äôs the proper way to set it up? I used /autorole rule set
`/autoroles mmr set`
But check out if u add them properly
i checked api documentation and didnt find it. One way is use player stats, because you can check match numbers in this post method
/api/history, should give u everything
That arent what post methods does
U mean get
yeah, get method. In History i was have only changes in queue settings
History has everything
You just would have to display the data u want to
<@648635725964902411> thanks! I was simply adding it wrong
One last issue I‚Äôm having is , the results stopped showing up in my ‚Äúresults‚Äù channel after a few queued games.
yeah, i check again and in history my data had only first 5 matches on serv
let me check
ah, you know, you are right
Will you fix it?
yes, should be quick
will update in a bit
try now
its working, thx
When creating a que for apex, how would i set mmr to adjust based on placements in the game and not just who wins? is that possible?
<@145305657237700608> 

hey man, how are you. 

What is the command to prevent players from joining queue while in a game
`/requeue condition`
Like a matchmaking search? /queuetype
like when the que ends and people are submiting scores. i want mmr to be given out to top 10 teams
<@648635725964902411>
Uh im not following
so when a que happens for apex its 20 teams but i dont want to just award the first place team with mmr, i would like to have the mmr to spread out between the top 10 teams in the lobby
Hmm yeah i dont think thats possible rn
okay thanks!
anyway i can create a new queue for something else in another channel? little confused on how that works
yeah
<@145305657237700608> how to generate api token, link on site doesnt work
just do /setup in whenever channel u want
/webhooks generatetoken
thanks. also, does the same apply for leaderboard and player stats? like i do that command in the new one and it‚Äôll be specifically for that queue?
yes, the commands u do in that channel, will apply to the queue in that channel
do i have to do the /setup for leaderboard and stats to work? i tried doing the config load but it says no queue found for the leaderboard
u do /leadeaboard in the channel where the queue is, or in another channel doing /link and then /leadearboard
is there a api call rate limit?
nope
i guess
there are rate limits for most endpoints, but they aren‚Äôt publicly visible in the docs üòõ
i linked the leaderboard channel to the new queue channel, but i can‚Äôt get it to show separate stats for the new queue

Whats the website to check the nodes
all my players are stuck in que rn
https://www.neatqueue.com/status
can we make the bot change the name from queue 6171 to match 6171?
/tempchannels name
Can we make it 2 votes required for a match, but once 1 vote is done, if no 2nd vote after 5mins, the 1 vote submits results?
you can just set up the `/timer matchcleanup`
it will automatically pick whichever winner has more votes
is there a way to give the player the option to ping/no ping a role (preferably a LFG role) after joining a queue?
same, idk what to do
how to give administrator permissions?
Via server settings
bot is suddenly changing nicknames by adding a star + numbers, what is this?
basically the mmr is being added in the nicknames
U toggled /ratinginname?
absolutely no
Do /logs
whats ur server id
266309652348665858
that doesnt look like a server
oh thats my id
1061281878549737572 should be this
do `/logs filter:ratinginname`
done
and?
someone probably toggled it on a long time ago, but the bot didnt have perms to nickname people
the "star" format isnt even the default
probably because I activated perms to the bot because I also have this problem
hmm, probably when u gave the perms the bot had the option to now change nicknames
that should be by default
imma disable this perm
just disable the command
`/ratinginname`
ok it seems fixed now
Is there a way for a custom message to be automatically sent in the temporary queue channel?
you can use `/lobbydetails` to add some custom text to the final "teams" message
Thank you
Sometimes some players get 1000 points even when they lose the game. This recently started happening after I started a new queue
wdym they get 1000
Starting mmr right
1000 is an inaccurate number but
I‚Äôll take more screenshots of people saying it
I thought it was the starting mmr
seems like it is
what does the points system mean/ do and am i able to set a command to give the top 5 in the leaderboard a top 5 role?
`/autoroles topplayers set `
appreciate it x
Is there any method to automatically DQ an opponent that does not show up?
wdym
can this timer start be done after 1 person has voted? seemed when i set time was from the start of the que pop?
I dont think u can do it like that
how do i make it so the one captain gets first player pick but the other captain gets first and third map pick out of 3? and can i do it like a coinflip?
it starts when the teams are made
Is it possible to have sperate leaderboards?  I have a queue for higher tier players and a queue for lower tier players

Yeah why

all good now, thanks
The Bot is queue banning everyone in the queue if 1 person doesn‚Äôt join vc?
and the bot is not creating queue channels as well ^
<@648635725964902411> how can I check what shard were on?

NeatQueue Hub is on node 2, shard 3
But that is this server, you need to do it on yours
Is there any issues with node 1, shard 4?
The bot is not creating queue channels and queue banning people
<@648635725964902411>

restarted node 1, should be good
Hello. I tried resetting my queue's leaderboard as well as the stats of the players who tested it but after 24 hours it's not yet reset. Im not sure if I made something wrong
What command did u use?
How does the /timer afk command work?
/ managestats reset all <name of my queue>  and
/ managestats reset mmr <name of my queue>
First command should have been enough
Do u have more than 2 queues maybe?
how does the sub feature work? if you sub someone in after say second map, do both the players get MMR, do they get the full mmr or half?
It subs the player giving the subbed player the mmr
right okay cheers
Hey guys, another question.

is there a config option that enables players in queue to choose Bo3 or Bo5?
use /bestof
gotcha, but is there a way to give the users the option to pick one or the other?  I want them to have the option to choose directly in the queue. the /bestof command only gives me the option to pick 1 option, right?
I was trying to use the following command : `/bestof number:3 vote:True voteselection:Majority eligible_voters:All`
> But I want there to be the option to pick 3 or 5 for the number
Do /bestof again with 5, and the same options
Thank you this worked! When I ran the command, however, I was given the option or 1, 3, or 5. Is there a way to just make it 3 or 5?
Also, is there an easy way to fix my issue with predictions? Whenever I make a prediction, it seems that my prediction is not properly casted becasue i am always refunded the prediction regardless of the outcome. I look all over the documentation and cant find a solution. As always, any help would be appreciate üôè
Hmm, i dont really know what happened
did anyone bet against you?
no haha this makes much more sense im an idiot üëä  btw any insight on this would be beautiful I cant get it to just display Bo3 & Bo5 ONLY - no Bo1 : https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/868549627652214794/1194734586454872156

`/mmr maximum`
But i dont really get what you mean at all
Wdym a 1600 doesnt play a 1050, queue matchmaking?
I have a question - is there a way to turn the "team selection" off in case we want to do 1v1v1v1v1...for example, not give the option of doing captains, balanced, etc. I would like it so that it just randomly pairs them with someone else that queued
/teamselection set
Perfect, thank you. When do I have to set this? Right away when the queue pops or any time in the /setup process?
you shouldn‚Äôt be using /setup often
once you make a queue, just keep it, don‚Äôt delete it
So the setup option is just the initial setup? Basically I just do that and it will be the same every time after that?
I work at a YMCA and trying to use this instead of other software since these seems much more customizable
Setup is just for an initial queue
You can then customize however u want it
Am I able to speak with someone tomorrow to iron out a few details?
Is there an option to disable team selection and just make it automatic instead?
Since this is for 1v1s, it‚Äôs not necessary
Change the /queuetype to pugs
Thank you
Question: When a player enters a queue, is there a way to send an anonymous ping to a lobby channel notifying everyone that a player entered the queue? I saw that you can change the name of the channel based on queue size, but a ping would be way more effective
<@648635725964902411> bot down?
yep, seems like it
<:o7:1147222271241506906>
Awesome üí™
I only have 1 atm.
Leaderboard still shows old MMR. üôÇ
make sure you select the Jan 2024 version when you reset stats
I would like to know if when the bot sends a private message, the teams could appear along with the room.

example:
The configuration we use is \n **Host**: HOST \n **Room Name**: ! ! Mix 6v6 PSOBR | discord.g/pso-br | QUEUENUM \n **Room Password**: PASSWORD8A

I would like to know if there would be a way to add the teams to appear
anyone know what the /test command fully does, for example atm i‚Äôm trying to test if i‚Äôve done the queue votes right, if i do /test it doesn‚Äôt mess anything up and just lets me overview how it‚Äôd look?
it just lets you join queue a bunch of times + instantly vote for anything
right okay thanks, so i can just end the test whenever and it doesn‚Äôt mess anything up?
yup!
how to disable user command to cancel queues?
Via server settings
Or u can just disable all the commands for users, disabling the application commands
to allow regular users the perms to vote on a win or loss, will i need to add a specific role and then give them those perms? or is there an easier method
How do i make q show names
/ anonymousqueue disable
Thanks
is it possible to have /ign available but queue cancel disabled for users?
Yeah via server integratioms
nvm, i see
Can anyone tell me if this is possible?
nope
Can /ign be in any channel or does it have to be in the queue channel?
queue channel
Is it queue specific or will it recognise it in all queues?
Hello, does the autolock and autounlock have been removed or has another code now?

thats automatic with the player ban wdym
how do I make the queue know it‚Äôs HP SND Control
i dont understand those terms
Thanks !
hey I have 2 different queues, I want them to work independently of each other, so their leaderboards and mmr will be different. how can i do that?
thats by default
unless you enabled serverwide leadearboard or the queues have the same name
I might have did this
`/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide`
I created a different queue but when I join it my score looks the same as my score in the other queue
ah okey it's done now
I opened this before
thank you
<:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
how do I make my 8s do HP SND Control instead of all HP
how do I show player stats and stuff
/stats and /leadearboard
yeah but how do I set it up
what is HP SND Control? are those 3 diff maps? gamemodes?
to show the stats cuz it brings me to a websites
just do /leadearboard
Hardpoint Search and Destroy and Control that‚Äôs what that means how do I make the bot know it‚Äôs those modes instead of hard point
okay
<@648635725964902411> one more question points do not appear on the leaderboard, how can I adjust this?
no stats are registered
you need 1 game at least to appear
it brings me to this <@648635725964902411>
i did
you have to vote the bot to access /stats or /leadeaboard
okay thank you
it was probably before u changed the settings
so its looking at different stats now
a few more games but still the same
So you mean, Its hardpoint search first, and then Destroy and control? its a best of 2?
ah sorry I had previously blocked the roles of the other queue in the queue to separate the rows, now I remember, this is my bad.
Best of 5 like Hardpoint first then Search then Control then Hardpoint then Search
you can do /bestof
and you can try /gamemode selection gamemode_choice:Ordered
Thank you
how can i turn off this
`/captains reshuffle toggle:`
How can I reset the points and stats of my desired queue? I want to do this for a new season
I want the other queue not to be affected

can someone please help me.
just drop ot
drop it?
the questions
multiple winners. in my case, 9 racers, top 4 gain mmr, ideall.
bot doesnt support multiple winners atm
know of any other bots that do? i've looked for hours.
i havent really tried more bots
Hey odd question maybe reading the guide im not udnerstanding
Can I make multiple queues but share the MMR?

Nice! So just have to run the normal /setup in another channel to create that queue and them amke the shared stats command?
setup asks u if u want serverwide stats too :)
or u just can name all the queues the same, and it will share stats aswell
tyty\
does nextqueue do placements?
a leadearboard?
position 1-9 for a round. basically just thinking of unique ways around my earlier problem
how i copy a menu from a channel?
someone 5vs5 lol config?
/config save, /config load
Hi, will Neatqueue ever have a feature to have a role be for fill/flex? (pick fill role, queue will pop when full and the people who pick fill are allocated to any remaining roles left in the queue.)
hi 
I charged my credit but I cannot choose the plan. Why?
Is there a problem with the site?
Is there a way to take away someone's Role of they hit a certain MMR in the Queue?
<@648635725964902411> is there a command to remove a specific amount of MMR from a specific player?
Can someone send me a YT tutorial for the NeatQ bot setup? 

If there even is one
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
/add mmr, and use negative numbers
When u set up the autorole you have the upper rating mmr, if a player passes that it will remove the role
So we have the issue that our queues chat sometimes still has the old messages from an old queue... how do we clear that up
Wdym?
It auto deletes the temp channels, i dont know what u mean
if they are reusing channels due to high bot usage it should purge all messages
maybe the bot restarted while it was doing that
it would be cool yes, i‚Äôm not currently working on it though
same issue?
Sometimes we have new queues but you can see the old messages from an old queue ... which happens now often
so i was looking for a solution
thx It worked
what server
BPL EU
hey there, i may be overlooking it, but how do you add game modes to the queue
`/map add`, you can specify the gamemode for each map
ok thank you
how do i start the random map selection
we have added the maps and added the selection to random
wait it says at the bot
Why is it that even if we dont vote piano man it still madehim capt
they must have the captains role
ahhhh
How do i remove that
he isnt
idk how he doesnt have a role tha dictates that
it would be /captains role
Is there a way to check how many matches have been played in a specific queue?
/serverstats info
How do you give staff the ability to type in queue channels
Of course you can give them permissions just through discord as usual
But how do you make it so they automatically have permission when a queue starts
You just can achieve that via discord perms
Category perms should work
Do you know how to reverse this
Add it again?
I only see the command to set
Wdym
That is the command, or idk what youre asking
Like I don‚Äôt see the command to add it again
When I do /autoroles mmr  I don‚Äôt see add
Only set and remove
how can i give a role permission to force sub. And only force sub..
maybe some others too
Actually this might not even be relevant
I did this
Then everyone in higher ranks lost the role
Theres no autoroles add, is set
dont do 49
do 50
Is there a way to give everyone the role back?üò≠
Nah it‚Äôs always been 49 it doesn‚Äôt change anything
nah the guy told me
its like
decimal defferences
Set it again at that mmr range
like theres 49.1
49.2
It should add back if they are in thr range
I wanna make sure everyone who has more than 49 or 50 still has unranked role though
Like I want everyone to have unranked role regardless of mmr
Me doing this command removed it from everyone so I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to reverse what I did but setting the mmr didn‚Äôt fix it
Probably because I did this
So now I‚Äôm confused
make sure to read the commands arguments, there is an option to say if the role will be exclusive or not
meaning either you have that role, or another role, not both
is there a way to see a players queue history other than them clicking the stats button?
you can watch all q history via API, but rn /stats are just for that, so no more commands than /leadearboard or /stats
It won't let me join the queue to play, it gives me the neat queue thing
what?
Whats
You haven't made a notification yet that there will be "mmr decay" for AFK? And it would be cool to set up a notification that Player1 got mmr decay for AFK
there is mmr decay, im not sure what you mean about afk
Mmr decay happens after not playing games for a certain amount of time. Right?
I'm talking about it, AFK - haven't played for 7 days, for example
whats the difference?
We once discussed that it would be a good idea to notify the player the day before mmr decay that they will soon lose their rating. I remind you of this, and I add that it would be nice to inform the admins that the rating was removed from the player for the lack of games
how do i fix this?
leaderboard before the game- still hasn‚Äôt updated at all
says this
all from one game?
rider in 23rd with 962 MMR on leaderboard
says he has that much MMR and has the 1st role?
apologies for spam, didn‚Äôt see the bug reports channel
mmr decay?
did u change any settings recently
haven‚Äôt changed it
i think it might be fixed now
nope
but then on the leaderboard it‚Äôs all correct, but doesn‚Äôt show it updated after the last result? only how it was before
like it says i‚Äôm on 922 MMR now, yet on leaderboard im on 1072, and that‚Äôs what i was before the game, i was only meant to lose 40
what‚Äôs the leaderboard show currently
refresh it?
yeah i have stays like that
it would update the time at the bottom
i know it‚Äôs been happening for a while, i‚Äôll refresh again for u
we‚Äôve just played another game too yet i‚Äôm still 6-4
and now someone else has 1st role too?
use /leaderboard in the queue channel
maybe you have multiple queues set up
that‚Äôs the queue
yet we just finished that game
honestly i have no idea what‚Äôs happened
what‚Äôs your server ID?
how do i check that?
if u give me the server name i can find it
zen and 2lous 8s
sorry it‚Äôs a & not a and
struggling to find it
got it
i see you have different stats under different queue names
did you have server wide stats enabled, but then you disabled it?
i see stats under names 3v3s, 2v2s, 8s, and the serverwide stats
yeah i did
right okay, so what do i need to do?
disable server wide?
or re-enable?
i thought i had to disable to have multiple queues with different leaderboards
yea that‚Äôs correct
your setup looks fine, you just don‚Äôt see the server wide stats anymore
so that‚Äôs affecting the roles and leaderboard etc?
so if i just get rid of the 1v1 and 2v2 queues and re enable server wide it‚Äôll fix it?
it shouldn‚Äôt be affecting anything since it‚Äôs disabled now
if you just /leaderboard instead of refreshing, is it the right stats?
i‚Äôve re enabled it now, it was disabled originally wasn‚Äôt it?
it‚Äôs disabled by default yes, but when you run /setup for the first time it asks if you want it enabled
hmmm
i‚Äôm pretty sure i had it enabled, and then today i made a seperate 1v1 and 2v2 queue, and disabled it
yea that should be fine
you just wouldn‚Äôt see the old stats, but everything else should work fine
that‚Äôs when i started having the issues tho, when i disabled it
so now i‚Äôve re enabled it and got rid of 1v1 and 2v2 queues should it be fine
i guess so
right ok, is there no way to get back the results for all the games we‚Äôve played?
and it‚Äôs still doing the weird things with the role i‚Äôm assuming i‚Äôm gonna have to go and fix that manually
you can use /managestats merge
i‚Äôm not sure what you were seeing, the stats seemed fine, it just seemed like an old leaderboard
the roles were all messed up and all sorts ahahah thanks for your help tho mate
just did this it‚Äôs worked but hasn‚Äôt copied the result from last game we played, must‚Äôve been because i changed it midway through
assuming there‚Äôs no way to get that back? if not then that‚Äôs all and thanks so much for your help mate x
yea, when switching the stats all around it‚Äôs gonna be messy
sorry for dragging you on so longü§£
depends what the stats name was for last game
if it was in the serverwide stats or not
no idea i merged 8s with player_stats
hello
whats the cmd to add another person to use NQ admin cmds?>
hey, can someone explain why the nb of mmr changes are diffrent in queue channel (before reporting win) and result channel
the first one is an estimate since everyone on the team will earn different mmr
so it‚Äôs a bit weird for 1v1
Can i make this estimate not appear in queue channel (still appears in result) to avoid confusion?
/staffrole add
can i delete a queue?

how does one get the queue to show up instead of it just saying the queue started?
you probably need to give the bot perms to send messages
how would one do that
nvm it has all the perms
it need admin to do it
I have the bot set to ban anyone from queueing for 10 minutes that doesn't join the match voice channel. I've gotten several reports today of entire lobbies getting banned that were in the voice channel due to inactivity. Any reason for this? What's the best way to troubleshoot it?
there‚Äôs a bug where it can sometimes see old version of the channel and not recognize there are new people in the vc
you‚Äôll either need to manually fix it when it happens, or disable that feature
got banned from queue even though i joined the vc, everybody was in the queue vc but the match never started
how can i change the default 1000 starting mmr
and if i do change it for example to 100, and the mmr change parameter from 50 to 5. will this be the same calculating mmrs % wise? or do i have to change something else as well ?
`/startingmmr set`
Hi just a question, in BPL we have two different divisions, they are separate queues, is there any way to make it so players with a role (premier) have a cool down where they can only play 2-4 games in the open queue in a 24 hour period?
That way we would avoid completely locking them out from Open queue while ensuring Premier queue gets games
Hmmm, no i dont think theres an actual option to limit games in a certain period
Alright might have to drop that under <#911057745204105237>
How do I set roles, for someone for example reaches 1250mmr
`/autoroles mmr set `
how does one make it to where when someone hits a certain rank they get a role on the way up and down?
it tells me to vote for the server to retrieve access, ive voted but whenever i refresh leaderboard it tells me the same thing
why is it that in the `queue #1` embed it says:

Pasqi 0 (+40.4)

Crispoe - 1000 (+9.6)
how come one of us has higher points even though that was the first match
What was the final mmrs at the end of the matcb
super weird
Do you have any starting mmr or did u set urself at 0?
as in for the queue setting?
i dont think it had an option
i made the queue on mobile
if that makes a difference
ill try redo it
Okay
does this mean mmr change per win/loss?
Thats the average for win and loss, but you can set for loss too using the change mmr command
ahh alr
okay so i fixed it
but i have 2 questions;

Why do i get +30.4 points instead of just the 30

and is there a cmd to wipe all/one player's mmr?
Theres an mmr calculation for that, so for example if i fight against higher mmrs than me, i will won more mmr if i win than them if they win
so its best to just leave it, yeah
If u want to just make it always 30 in the /mmr change set, you have an optional parameter to make it static
So win can always be 30
what abt the clear player/everyone mmr
/managestats reset all, or /managestats reset player
alright im very sorry for this
but i have *one* more question and then i will leave you alone for today
is there a way to make losers not go into negative points?
i just need the minimum points at 0
`/mmr minimum`
<:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
i lied
theres still a bunch of questions i have
How do i make the queue pick the highest rating players as captain?
`/captains selection`
is there also a cmd that lets captains pick specific players 

and how can i add gamemodes - such as tdm/snd?
is there a trick to upload an image url when adding a map?
can i review a specific players match history?
Hey guys! Is there a "confirm I am here and joining this game" mechanism that does not involve joining a voice channel? I couldn't find anything like this in the documentation
Wdym a trick, you have the option to add the image in /map add
/stats, but its limited
well everytime i post the url it seems not to work or just says interaction failed
soon
Awesome, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
You can upload an image to an image upload service and copy that url
you can post the URL here
https://images.app.goo.gl/ZdKo47evDmWPiPm48 this was the link
https://www.callofduty.com/content/dam/atvi/callofduty/cod-touchui/blog/hero/guides/tout/MWIII-MAPS-07-KARACHI-TOUT.jpg Use this as the link, that's just a webpage that happens to contain a link
exactly, you need the direct URL
One more question - is there a way to get newlines in the lobby details? I tried double space, \\(doublespace), <br> but none of them worked
You can try `Hi\nHi2`
i tried that link that you gave me and it just said this application did not respond
That did it. I can't believe I didn't try that one <a:facepalm:590676310066462725>. Maybe add it to the documentation :P
Well since its python, i guess it worked out hehe
honestly i thought it was in there
supporting <br> might be smart too
Theres commands that needs to be out of docs too
or \ which is markdown i think
player autoban is no more
Global q aswell
Thanks for helping y'all, excited to try this bot once the ready up is in :)
<:pepeOk:1179576926613020772> <:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
probably will be tomorrow since its along side a tournament system revamp
Hello, I'm receiving this error:
This server is only allowed 1000 players in the system. Please upgrade your premium to allow more players!
While we only have around 200 players playing our queues
whats the server id
1043184884212043848
i am seeing 1000 players in the system on my end
which means 1000 unique people who have entered into a queue
How is it possible? Maybe something got wrong with some rolerequirement?
Is there a way to remove all players who don't have a certain role from the queue?
I think there was a problem with our universal queue
if you do `/managestats reset` with the queue names, it will delete the queue data
so that can solve it for you probably
Ok I'll try thanks
lmk when done and i can check too
anyway i can add an MMR multiplier for specific players?
give them a special role and then do `/mmr multipliers set role: multiplier:`
i think it didn't work
what did you try? I still see UNIVERSAL stats
yeah i did managestats reset all queuename UNIVERSAL twice but i think it didn't do it
i dont see that in the logs
i don't know, I also wrote "confirm" twice
what did it say after
it was just loading and then disappeared
should I try with reset mmr?
no that wont be enough
oh looks like it worked?
i see 503 players now
With no setup step, this message is showing up (and confusing our players :P). Voice channels are set to optional
i think it took like 4 minutes to process the command
yea maybe
what ur config `/config save`
LDRCI
hmm maybe a permissions issue?
It's the lobby voice channel - which is immediately deleted as we have no setup steps enabled
i see what u mean
you should just disable it lmao
Does that still generate the team voice channels? We are using those but optionally
true, i guess not
with the Ready Up update its gonna decouple the lobby voice channel and team voice channels, so you can indepedently set them
currently its all intertwined and weird
think it's working now thanks
yea this is what your config looks like using the new `/lobbychannel toggle` command
Oh one thing I just noticed. When I used the managestats reset all command, it didn't reset the queue config, while it reset everything when I used managestats reset mmr
is it intended?
wdym the queue config?
i remember I did a reset mmr for that universal queue at the start of the year, and I had to load the config
actually I forgot I could reload the config so we manually set it up again from 0 xd
but it did reset every setting of that queue
hmm not sure, neither of those commands touch queue configs, only stats
can you please check if it's something related to the command?
cause that was weird but i'm 100% sure it reset everything
and it's also weird cause I usually do it every 3 months as a "hard reset"
for the other queues
not sure, seems to work fine
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> Could you take a look on RankedSimLeague please?
35ppl in queue, not finding matches
is there a cmd that lets captains pick specific players 

and how can i add gamemodes - such as tdm/snd?
are they close enough mmr?
wdym pick specific players, thats by default, you have a list that shows the players
and you add gamemodes in the optional parameter in /map add
mmr change for the winner and one for looser
example: winner gets 60 looser losts 30
`/mmr change set`
again same issue
yea, they are rate limited by discord
so i could add TDM mode doing that
what if i wanted to add diff maps as well?
Just do /map add again
i have two people that i made admins and now their rank never changes.
i can set mmr them and it doesnt work
their role?
I'm getting reports of this happening in the queue. Instead of it autosubbing, or even just making a new queue with the next person in the queue, it's ending the queue and kicking everyone
<@145305657237700608> if youre speaking to me its just admin
also Queue #813 VCs crashed mid series for some reason and the vote is not available for the winners and i dont have it in the results channel
hmm, not being able to give the admins a role could be of perms, the bot cant give roles to admins bc of perms, thats probably the main cause
I have admin and im fine
as is four others with admin roles
yea i probably should have announced but the auto sub thing has been disabled for now due to a bug
with people ending up in multiple matches
although, it should requeue i believe
I set `/requeue matchcancelled` to automatic. I'm assuming that would be the fix? I didn't check the setting was before. I probably should've done that lol
yes, that command dictates if people are requeued
Hey all! I have two quick questions regarding config options for my matchmaking queue(s):

**Is it possible to:**

1. Offer a bounty on players, such as beating X person gives 2x elo? It would be ideal if I could configure my bounty players with a role.

2. Give a small boost to players for being in the top 3 most games or something (to encourage some minor level of farming)? I would also like more info on common boost configs that people like to use for their queues to encourage longterm activity
having an issue in BPL NA. the bot isnt going down but its more that its not responding. as staff i can clear the queue no problem. but when people hit "join queue" it doesnt show them in the queue. it doesnt say "interaction failed"? or anything either its like they hit join queue and nothing happens but then like 5-10 minutes later EVERYONE who hit join queue during that time its not responding gets queued all at once
its been happening repeatedly the past hour or so
results are showing incorrect, but points are going to the right ppl. just seems like an administrative change
when the results are modified with /outcome, it won't update the normal "Winner For Queue" message
we didnt use /outcome, staff picked the winner. assuming it does the same thing
oh sorry, yes they are the same
Hello i think there is a problem with WIN% Calc
why "Tano" have 100% of win rate with 2 wins and 1 loss
Hi there, i just found this Bot, which is really huge and nice üòÑ there is a lot of potential coming up for some events.
But actually iam just looking for a "Simple Queue". I just used the /setup so far and made some Teams etc... 
Now i need to know...
...How to:
- remove the seperate Voice AND Text channels?
- ping every queued Player after full queue in the same channel, where u can join/leave?
- remove DMs?
`/tempchannels toggle`
`/matchstart dmplayers`
can i specify per Role, who can click on those buttons?
Wdym
Like, who can join and who cant
what i want is: everyone can see the channel with the queue thing and how many player r actually in it, but can not click on "Join/Leave queue" ... but ONLY user with Role XY can press the "Join/Leave queue" buttons
Ah ok
`/rolerequirement add` but first `/rolerequirement remove: @ everyone` and then u can do the first command
worked, thx alot üôÇ
Any idea why the bot is now kicking people from queue after 3 mins <@145305657237700608>
whats it say
Removed for 3mins of inactivity <@145305657237700608>
`Player Left Queue Due To Inactivity`?
that would be /timer afk
The MMR multiplier <@145305657237700608> im not sure its actually multiplying, does the queue need to be player vs player MMR, or is there anything else that needs to be active?
as long as you dont have static MMR enabled it should work
not sure why my roles are staying with the conditions i set. 

i have two different queues but want both queues to have the same roles. top player gets one and if you play more than 15 matches you get another. everytime i add one or the other, it removes one. 

/autoroles topplayers set role: "role" number: 1
/autoroles games set role:"role" lower_value:15 upper_value:9999 only_one_allowed:False
what am i doing wrong?
if its the same role, you would need both conditions to keep the role
ex: if you are rank 1 but only have 5 games, the bot would see you dont meet the requirement for the role and then removes  it
PERFECT! thanks
After doing this it doesn't show up the join que
make sure the bot has permissions to send messages
We accidently did a game were we didnt enable mmr, anyway to still give the team that won mmr and the team that lost mmr?
The queue created now 2 voice channels, I did nothing. Before that there was only the text channel
Can u deactivate this?
ooo, maybe i missed that with the update
you'll need to manually disable `/voicechannels teamchannels`
Hmm ok
Btw, really nice bot ‚ù§Ô∏è
Also, since today are my auto roles not working, do I need to recreate them?
<@145305657237700608> can you change captain selection and team selection to an active queue, as the command gives no options currently?
You can with /teamselection and /captainselection
there is no option to choose anything
Run command first
hmm i dont think they would have been impacted
run `/autoroles refresh` if its lagged behind
What do you mean?
Run the command, I think it will let u select things then
Type the command in chat*
wow, üòÑ
my bad
See I'm mod alredy
Support I mean
il give the support role to whoever wants it lmao
how can i remove mmr manually?
`/add mmr`
Ahahaha w, is Don soap and the other guy getting paid? I mean he's answering every singel small question.
is like an emoji
This guy studied the bot
any way or plans to make the gamemodes a full-lobby vote instead of a captain vote?
looks like its currently controlled by `/map voting`
not currently... but in the future for sure
Could someone show me an example of how I could add these specific maps and add them to the specific mode - without mixing it al together
Cause some maps aren‚Äôt allowed in other modes
`/map add map_name:Farm game_modes:TDM`
`/map add map_name:Subway game_modes:TDM,S&D`
two examples, can add as many gamemodes as you want
Thank god
You‚Äôre a life saver
Real quick, what‚Äôs the cmd to add a game mode üòÖ
Is it game_modes?
there isnt, you add with the map
Ahh alr
Does the second sentence you wrote down mean I can just add maps and it‚Äôll automatically direct to the last game mode added?
multiple gamemodes for a single map
so it can be picked for any of those gamemodes
Rightyo
But I could just do it like the first one, and then redo by changing the mode?
I could just add all the maps to that one mode (using the formula in the first sentence),

And then do the exact same thing but instead of the game mode TDM, I‚Äôd change to SND
sure thats fine
Lmao thanks
`/map add map_name:Subway game_modes:TDM,S&D`
is the same as doing 
`/map add map_name:Subway game_modes:TDM`
`/map add map_name:Subway game_modes:S&D`
Yeye
I messed up, how can I remove all the maps & modes
you can do `/map remove`
and it should pop up with an ALL options
Thanks
is there a way to create a BO3 game thingo, where game 1 is either TDM/S&D, and then the 2nd game is whichever mode waasnt picked?
`/bestof`
do i have to add the modes/maps first?
Well, yeah
... oops
i can just add after right
order doesnt matter
i added all the maps to the correct modes, and did the BO3 thing, does that mean the last round will randomly select a gamemode?
depends on your `/gamemode selection`
I‚Äôm new here and needing help figuring out how to set up for MW3 Elo in private matches
In channel topic you have a basic guide and the docs
If u cant figure something out you can ask here c:
Thanks. I‚Äôll check it out
whenenver the queue pops, it moves the waiting room channel below the game channels.
is there any fix for this?
Not really
<@648635725964902411> having issues in BPL na right now. we have a ton of traffic right now so that might be why. its creating queue channels but the bot doesnt load into that channel for another 5-10 mins and its not creating vcs
^^^ not doing it at all now, also BPL
<@145305657237700608> pls help when you are around. its not creating matches now üò≠
lemme look
<:ApuFlower:894644403526856765>
if i set it to random,it'll only select a random mode on the first & last round, right?
since the only modes i have are tdm and snd
if its random, it will be random for every map
Is it currently possible to disable parties for a tournament? Like players join as individuals and get put into teams based on MMR
thatd be a cool idea, but no currently you have to signup with the entire team
So if I have parties disabled for the server I couldnt use the tournaments currently then right. Is there any work around for this?
without parties, it would have to be a 1v1 tournament
okay, if you make a tournament mode without parties I'll definitely be using it
sounds good, that seems achievable and would be pretty cool
i guess after the registration mode it would just divide all the players into teams
very general question... but what is the point of the prediction points? link is there a leaderboard for prediction points? am I just missing something?
yea you can view points on the leaderboard
as for the purpose... there is none, it basically just fuels predictions
I mean, if the first round is TDM, then the 2nd round *has* to be S&D, and then the last round is random?
how are you ensuring the first round is tdm
Well I‚Äôm not, what I‚Äôm asking is, *say* the first round is TDM, will the 2nd round automatically be the other mode?
depends on how you configure map selection
Okay‚Ä¶ will the ‚Äúrandom select‚Äù option work?
Is there a way to change the queue size?
I don‚Äôt really want to redo the entire queue setup
`/queuesize`
everything in `/setup` has a command equivalent
I selected the random game-mode selection, but the 2nd game was also S&D
I‚Äôm so close to completing it all
How can I make the 2nd round *not* randomly selected?
`/gamemode selection`
this command entirely determines how gamemodes are picked
Only problem is that I only have 2 game modes, and `ordered` mode won't work if I'm tryna make the last round's gamemode   `random`ly selected
yea theres no way to achieve that
Ahh rip
What's the cmd to put this match result In another channel?
`/resultschannel`
Is that different to this
yea thats `/staffchannel`
Alright kewl
<@145305657237700608> the bot is creating reserve channels now? What is this for?
Its because the rate limit that discord has
ive lowered the threshold due to issues with some servers hitting the limit
so more servers will start seeing it as a result
"technically" the bot is only allowed to make 500 channels per day, which is documented by discord
So are they channels for upcoming matches?
they will be used in future matches, yes
instead of a new channel being made, it will reuse one of those
How many of them will it store at one time?
depends on how many matches you are playing at a time
this currently will only turn on if the bot has created more than 750 channels in your server within 24 hours
quite a lot
Hello!
I would like to know if there is a way for staff to view the lobby details, like the example below from another bot:
If not, I would like to suggest this addition, it would be very useful to better manage our games
yes, check out this link https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobbydetails-set
but, i can view the password?
This command is used to define the message we receive via DM, but what I want is for the staff team, even if they are not at the match, to be able to view the password too
you would have to change the `/lobbydetails location` so its not in DMs
since it wont DM staff
It's an option that I questioned that could be valid, but it makes it difficult for players to enter the lobby, not receiving the message in the DM.
Would there be any command to manage the matches?
im not sure what you mean
I would like the staff to be able to view the lobby password without necessarily being in the match, so that it is easier to manage
then yea, you cant use the DMs i guess
I don't say messages via DM.
I say a command that was typed and it shows the lobby information
I know that we can define a chat to control the staff, and I have this defined
i guess the lobby details should show up here
But what I would like is for the lobby password to appear in this message
im agreeing, yea that would need to be added
If you could configure this little option, it would help a lot.
If there is a possibility, I'm very happy, that's for sure.
sure i can add that
I would like to know if it is possible for the message sent in the DM of queue players together with the lobby to show the teams that were formed

example:

Lobby: RANKED 6V6
Password: zjsan

Team 1
yokumura

Team 2
yokumura
Nope, i dont think u can edit DM messages to send
In this case there would be no way to show the teams along with the lobby message
Wdym? Teams already show when a match is created
Yes, but you wouldn't be able to make them appear together with the Lobby and Password in DM
No, you cant send the team and a random password each time
Lobbydetails set, are defined
do you guys know if theres a way to set it for the top player role so they have exclusively 1 role for placement on leaderboard?
this is my #1 player in my server i run
https://i.imgur.com/Z3soFBc.png
they have the #2, #3, #4, #5, and top 10 roles as well
nah theres no way, i need to change it so you can specify ranges of placements
similar to /autoroles mmr
yeah the only one role allowed type command? that would be dope üôè
i was thinking more so along of lines of:
Top 1 =  1 - 1
Top 2 = 2 - 2
Top 3 = 3 - 3
Top 4 = 4 - 4
Top 5 = 5 -5 
Top 10 = 5 - 10
ranges for who gets the role
oooohhhhhh makes sense
that would be so dope
how do u remove someone that joined the queue?
/player remove
what happens when it says neatqueue is restarting
anything that can be done? like lets say i was in a queue
should always be a short downtime, then it picks back up
how do i auto make it captians only?
and for mmr
`/captains selection`
<@145305657237700608> any idea why the bot isnt deleting VC's now?
Only started doing it today
what server ID
1187822983255957586
also is there a way to still force people to join vc with the 'Ready up' option enabled?
nah you cant do both
perhaps a feature then would be, once all have readied up, it pulls them into vc?
are those matches all done?
yeah
is there a channel pool in the server?
the reserve thing?
not today, there was yesterday
whats your config if you /config save
and is it still doing it right now
its not doing it currently
for all queues?
just one of the queues its doing it in
i dont know from what queues they have come from, as they were just dead vc's
perhaps cancelled queues?
could be, im not able to replicate unfortunately for some reason
yea, looks like those are cancelled matches
Why he don‚Äôt ping player ?
<@145305657237700608>
turn off `/anonymousqueue`
Thanks
<@145305657237700608> i'm getting 'Unauthorized' error when trying to extend premium
try relogging in
For whatever reason, `/requeue matchcancelled mode:Automatic` isn't working. It does for a little bit, but it's like it resets or something. We have to keep using the command.
Are you loading an old config or something?
I'm pretty sure it's doing it, even though the queue hasn't been ended or started. I just made sure it was set up correctly, ended it, and loaded up the correct queue. I'll let you know if it does it again.

Is there a way to see what the current loaded config is to see if it's the same?
is thera anyway to automatically end the queue after a certain amount of time?
/timer matchcleanup
ty very much
is there one wher ei can change the time when the lobby closes automatically
Wdym lobby
how can i add the player's elo to their nickname
like once the queue vc gets made it automaticaloly closes after 5 minutes, can we change thattt?
Its the command i sent you...
`/ratinginname`
oh mb
Having an issue saying needs permission to manage channel when the queue bot has all the permissions
I set the min points for the bronze role to 100, and the bot dmed saying that it gave the player his role
But when I checked his roles it seemed otherwise
Is there a way I can get credits transfered from 1 of my servers to a new one? just wondering
is there a feature that can prevent 2 active players of being matched many times in a row or in general
like for example 24 hours cooldown between the same players or smthing
Not really
Hello guys
any possibility for player to lose mmr due to decay to exact number? I mean the loosing f.e 100, 100, 100 to maximum 1200
Hmmmm
Not really to stop it to a certain mmr
so maybe this would be a good feature? üòÑ
<@648635725964902411> is there a way to limit staff to certain commands?
`/staffrole command deny`
Hey quick question is there a way to get only 1 voicechat for everyone? Like right now I am using it for a TCG and I want it so if the queue pops both players join a single voice chat and doesnt kick them back out after
you can enable /lobbychannel toggle
and disable /voicechannels teamchannels
ahhh see I read that wrong gotcha let me try that
to require both players to join the VC use /readyup but it should default to what you want
Ty ty I dont think the bot deso this but maybe I missed it, can I have it select one of my pre made voice chats?
nah it will make a new channel per match
Roger ty ty will update more as I tweak and get further testing of issues
What‚Äôs the cmd to take a players mmr?
Wdym 'take'
Nvm I found it
I meant remove mmr but it‚Äôs Alg
Ah yeah add mmr but negative numbers
Yeah I guessed it when I couldn‚Äôt find any other option
how to make the voicechannel not maximum 5 <@648635725964902411>
one more, any possibility to prevrnt ppl to join 2 different queues simultaneously?
or even better remove them from the other queues when one of the one he was signed to start?
That depends on the teamsize
Or you can disable it
`/channel restrictions `
When a game starts it will kick them out of the queue that the player is double queueing
Also players cant join another queue until game is finished, unless you have changed the requeue condition
thank u man
oh thanks
just wondering, idk if its an option, but it would be cool if the only way people could join a queue by being in a specific vc
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/910981294937210930/1192708630118670448
Anyway to make it where there's no vote on who wins??
At the end of the queue
And make it to where they just end the queue with a prompt
on the neatqueue bot how do i make it where the join queue pop up goes to a certain channel?
you can just move the queue to a different channel
/endqueue in that channel, then use /config load
Is there a way to make it more streamlined then that?
Or just take the vote away?
Like an end queue button?
As opposed to having to have people remake it every time?
What setting is this?
Hey, players in my server cannot post in the game threads that are created for each match. How can i allow that
i have set permission to allow send messages with "/tempchannels permissions set"   command and yet they cannot type in the thread üò¶
nevermind i have my channel permission wrong, silly me
Hi, it's my first time using the bot and I'm having a lot of trouble understanding it, can anyone help me?
/staffchannel set
I mean, if u dont want MMR to be won, you could set the mmr change to 0, but youll have to report every match anyways or players, theres not an actual way to end the match without reportinb besides cancelling it everytime
you can use /message winnermessage results and disable them
no vote required, no wins losses or mmr
pretty hidden command
Interesting

I started using the bot yesterday but I'm having difficulty using it, can someone call me privately for help?
How do I make a list like this? defining the number of players per class, etc.?
/roles
How do I make the bot pull everyone into channels automatically?
If u mean from start, they need to join a lobby vc, and then they will be moved through the setup
`/lobbychannel set`
When the teams close, it would be necessary to choose the maps, etc., how would I do this "pickban"
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
And for bans is /map bans
Hi. How is now "/voicechannels mode disable" ?. I can't create new queue without voicechannles
<:hmm:1172617247320195123>
i didnt understand
To set that it is not necessary to enter the voice channel.
Before there was the command "/voicechannels mode disable".
Oh, the command probably got renamed or idk rn
Oh yeah
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/910981294937210930/1197058643493924995
oh i see. ty
So, for some reason, the leaderboards for 2 of my different queues are merged
If they got the same name they will
Or if u activated leadearboard shared stats
activated leaderboard shared stats?
`/leaderboardconfig sharedstats`
ah, gotcha. also, I'm guessing that a unique leaderboard isn't created on the bot side until games are played under that queue?
<@857633321064595466> goldenrule
All stats are tied to the queue name!
If queues have the same name, they will share the same leaderboard!
Otherwise, the stats are totally separate!
Basically if u have a lb with a diff name that lb will be just for that queue
And to display the player on lb, the required games are at least 1
You can change the required games
how to disable this <@648635725964902411>
Set the winner of the queue 253
i need to disable this option ,, everyone can press que while the other que working
how to do it?
<@648635725964902411> sorry For mention
`/requeue condition`
Dont innecesary ping btw <:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
Getting this issue a lot lately where we get an overflow on the queue and it just kicks everyone without doing anything. So we all have to join again
matchmaking?
Pickup games
or it takes like a veryyy long time
whats ur config
also what server?
can i force add players to the queue
yes `/player add`
cheers
or right click the player
Saved config under KPC
Just normal PUGs with captains and vc ready
u guys play a lot of matches?
over like 50 a day
but usually not more than 100
It happens when a game gets cancelled because someone didn't join and the queue overflows.
Usually it will just remove the right people and start a new game
but sometimes it just doesn't do anything
or there is a delay for a long time
but we can all join queue again after, so I don't think it's the latter
that does sound strange, if it‚Äôs PUGs it should start a match once it‚Äôs at 8/8
and prevent anyone from joining
<@145305657237700608> Currently I admin the discord for Dojo and we're looking to implement a bot that auto generates voice channels based on results on the website via webhooks. My team is interested in having a discord with you about implementation of neat queue in some way or possibly a custom option. If you're interested in that feel free to DM me or the website owner. <@721878918092816414>
We run high and low entry Tournaments for Warzone. just to be more clear.
if you are just making voice channels, you probably don‚Äôt need NeatQueue
Sometimes when I call the API I get "Internal Server Error" 500
and then other times I just get a response back
https://api.neatqueue.com/api/matches/serverid
on this at least
It's kind of annoying getting the error. It's not like I'm spamming the API
yea thats an unexpected error, ill try and take a look
New to NeatQueue, so sorry if this is in the wrong location and/or a simple question. What is the command for people sitting in queue to be pulled in if somebody doesn't join before the join timer expires?
theres no command, unfortunately it has been disabled for now due to a bug
Is it possible to make the bot apply two roles at once, or make a hierarchy for which one shows if it has both?

We have badges for the division roles, but not for the sweats trialist role.

When people are between 800-1000 mmr, it's not showing a badge. We would like it to still show the badge for the division.

My immediate thought is to make it apply Div 1 for 700-799 and 801-999, while leaving sweats trialist as is.

Thoughts?
you can definitely have multiple autoroles apply at once if you disable them being exclusive
you probably want Sweats Trialist to not be exclusive
`/autoroles mmr set only_one_allowed:False`
Perfect. Thanks!
hey all! is there a way to autorole a user when they are on a # winning streak?
i guess i didnt add streak autoroles, so no
Is this feature request worthy? <:BrownPeepoPlan:1110588264664027238>
sure
is there a way to edit this?
as in like remove "balanced" for example
<@145305657237700608>
What‚Äôs the cmd to end an active queue like this?
Just to cancel that specific queue/game would be /outcomecancel then enter queue number as option.
hey i need help to fix this in my server made many mistakes could you join for sometime and help me ill give u role
Oops. What does ‚Äúendqueue‚Äù do?
Ends the actual queue that people join to create the games queues
What is it exactly you need help with
to setup some stuff its giving errors and im doing it wrong to setup matchmaking but customsed
# NeatQueue Documentation Links

If you are unsure on what commands are available and what command purposes are:

Documentation: https://docs.neatqueue.com

Basic Guide: https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
you able to screenshot the errors you are receiving?
/teamselection set
thanks
So basically I  fully messed up my queue system
Would the cmd only work in the queuing channel? Or could I use that cmd to end the queue from any channel I'm in?
(`/endqueue`)
Just that channel youre in
How can I disable this message?
`/teamselection reshuffle `
Every time I try to setup the bot nothing loads
Is that a private channel, that seems related to perms not be abling to send
Check out that the bot is able to send embed links
I was dumb mb, I did not give it the bot role so it was not allowing it to setup. Thank you for getting back to me
<:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
After deleting lobby with readyupmode button voice channel didnt delete
(clarification, if one of the players did not press Ready)
Getting a lot of interaction failed messages when picking players but it still picks them.
is there anyway the roles could change randomly?
context: no one played extra games to gain or lose the role
do you have mmr decay on?
these are the logs, and I doubt ppl can delete log info...right?
no you can‚Äôt delete logs
i guess depends if mmr decay was ever enabled
since decay happens after 1 week by default
Hey Neat, my new members of the server keep getting this message whenever they try to join the queue, but I‚Äôm pretty sure we pay for the premium membership. Would you be able to verify this? I‚Äôm from the select 11s discord to verify which sever
my parameters are 15 games played and less than 100 to have both roles. and the top player is still #1 so i‚Äôm not sure what it is.
does anyone have that top role?
one person in one of my queues and not on the other because they have not completed the 15 games
and you can‚Äôt delete items from logs if message is deleted? just curious where it‚Äôs getting changed
only thing that i found was a person left the queue when the roles changed
he never joined queue either
is it a role for the top 1 player?
if someone already has it, i‚Äôm not sure what the issue is
let me see if i can explain it better:

- i have two queues, 2v2 and 8s
- they both have the same roles
- one person from the 8s queue has it bc they‚Äôve played more than 15 matches and less than 100
- the leader in the 2v2 queue has only played 8 matches out of the 15 required; but at 3AM he got the  ‚Äútop player‚Äù role
and the guy from 8s who had it, lost his role
are stats shared between the queues
no, separate stats, mmr, no mmr decay
only one person will ever have the role
if you compare the person who has it and the person who used to have it, who is higher mmr
understood, just not sure how the second person got the role if they did not meet the game set requirement.
autoroles top players doesn‚Äôt have a game requirement
used to have it: 415
has it: 660
it‚Äôs just whoever is highest mmr
yeah, but i thought when i set it up, you stated they have to meet the game set role to then be able to get the top player role
i guess they must show on the leaderboard actually
is the 660 player on either leaderboard?
he is
yea that‚Äôs all that matters then
they are on the leaderboard and have the highest mmr, so they get the role
so it bypasses the game set requirement of games between 15-100 that i set?
here
autoroles games and autoroles topplayers are entirely separate
so yes
it doesn‚Äôt combine the conditions
i never thought about that
<@145305657237700608>
Hello! Is there a way to run more then one ten mans with the bot at once? (If there is a premium version that does this I would be more then happy to pay for it)
You can just create another queue in another channel
can you give me the server id
what don soap said, or enable `/tempchannels` and the queue will instantly be emptied when a match starts
dont need to wait around for teams to setup or anything, just queue
1184332531307384924
doesnt look like the server has premium currently
How do you disable ppl from queing if they are in a match?
Hi regarding the payment for the credits any other payment method?
Thats by default
Wait, i dont understand at all, what do you want to disable
You want them able to queue again if they are in a match
Guys, any possibility to check the order of how the captain were choosing player?
/info
**Draft type**
doesn't the bot have the option to prevent players who are currently playing from joining the next queue?
by default, players cant queue until they vote for a winner
for example, 5-10 minutes after the queue started, there are already some players who vote for a random team and enter the next queue, stealing a place from those who are not playing
you can change the `/requeue condition`
but beware, players can now get stuck in a match if not enough people vote
i mean, not the type but who exactly did they pick one by one while match making
that info isnt tracked
too bad, thanks
I'm still getting the issue that after a game cancels because a player didn't join, it just completely empties out the queue without adding the new players. Or it adds the players, removes them to make a game but it doesn't do that. Instead it just removes the players only
whats ur config
another question, have a suggestion to deal with the MMR problem per role in queue?
What mmr problem
role in question
for example, someone who plays the doctor role has a low mmr, but plays well with the scout pocket, and will have a low mmr
so not balancing right
i don't know if you understand
but like, mmr per role, have some solution to that?
no theres no way to fix that
Saved under KPC
the issue is getting really annoying
is it every time?
I'm pretty sure yea
how can i disable partys?
Hey all im back! quick questiion. is there a way to give a player bonus MMR if they beat a player w a specific role?
Nope
/partyqueue toggle
damn aight ty
It's telling me i need to add manage channels permissions when I have already done so to use setup
first time using this trying to set up a pretty in demand server want to make sure its running well
<@857633321064595466> perms
> ### Why am I getting a permissions error?
> There is various reasons that can raise this error, please make sure to check the following points to solve it:
> - The bot has the necessary permissions.
>   - The bot can send messages and manage channels.
> - If you assign a role to the bot, ensure it doesn't overwrite the bot's permissions.
> - Category and channel permissions do not override the bot's permissions.
>   - If the category or channel is private, add the bot to it through the settings.
> **Fast fix:** Give the bot administrator permissions.
thank you admin worked
how to set up multiple queues
I have set up my 2v2 queue
but I need a 3v3 queue as well that is on the same MMR
just create another queue in another channel
I also setup the 2v2 que but when I start que it only uses 2 teams when I set 5 teams
using /setup to set it up
willing to pay to have someone sit in call and help me set it up
can u share your config? do /config save
Do I need to do setup each and every time?
you can copy the config of a queue that you have been made in the past, by /config save and then /config load in another channel and you can tweak it
also you didnt have to end queue
do /config load, and the code it dropped to get it back
so how each time i start a que in 3v3s do I use that code?
now*
and I go do another setup in 2v2s
once you setup a queue, you don‚Äôt have to set it up again
it will just run forever
but if you want more types of queues, yes you must set them up
when i start que it makes me set player number and does not use my setup file
you have to use /config load
interaction failed, when happens what should i do?
is anybody available to sit in a voice call to help finalize the setup of this
willing to pay
you got a basic guide on this channel topic
i need the advanced walkthough that is why I am willing to pay
my brain smol and I want it fully setup for MMR combined matchmaking between 2v2s and 3v3 queues with rank roles ect.
voice channels for waiting room and certification on in game name ect
Basic guide kinda really covers that
i am dumb
I can't figure out how to have it make a waiting room that will pull people into their channels when teams are picked
it‚Äôs /lobbychannel toggle
thank you
one other question. How do I make people be required to use /IGN to set their in game before having access to the rest of the channels
./requireign
will it automatically create voice channels for teams when game starts
bro what u did is a master piece

hey guys so quick issue. I had a player gambling on the matches and he was able to bet negative points... any advice on how to resolve this issue?
you'll have to manually adjust the points
... how did they do that?
oh, nvm...
also, is there a way to let spectators talk in VC when spectating a match in the queue vc?
`/spectatorrole add role:@NeatQueue can_speak:True`
ok so i just ran this command, but the spectators in the vc are still "suppressed". any suggestions?
wont change until future games
ok ok thanks for the help as always
also what is the purpose of having prediction points? is there a way to view prediction point leaderboards or compare each others prediction points... how does it work?
Prediction points are just points
You can see them on /stats
also on the leaderboard
bet thanks guys
with the require ign thing is there a way to set a role on said people who set their IGN
hmm no, theres no autorole for that
is there a possible way to add that in or is that planned in future
would be cool to use that similar to a reaction role
when they do that after entering server it gives them access via roll perms ect
an idea anyway
or wait
do you mean it makes a role automatically
autoroles is the system i have for assigning roles based on conditions
so yea an IGN condition would be good
although im not sure on the use
just like a verificatoin upon joining
is how I would use it
will be for escape from tarkov so like to know who joins before they que ect
it wouldnt really help since they would have to use the command first
yes, that channel for the command would be open to everyone
rest locked behind the role
when you use /ign, it assigns your starting mmr as well
oh wait so i can use that as a thing
so you can make an autorole for MMR which is just like -1000000 to 1000000 mmr
okok
could be handy to have the option to do for ign as simpler option so people like me dont have to use the brain power on that one lol
but that definatly works the same
so for rank roles, I just make all the rolls and then use autorole to set an mmr to assign said roles?
How do I combine the MMR between 2 queues
was literally just about to ask this
how would you make different queues use one shared leaderboard ?
I also need to know how to set auto ranks. when I am using a base -10000000 to 100000000 mmr as a verificatoin role. it seems to only set that then ignore the roles I setup for ranks.
i figured it out xD
how!!!
plz tell
"/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide toggle:Enabled" is how you link all queues to one leaderboard
but you wont be able to add 2 different mmr systems together
it's either seperate mmr/leaderboards for seperate queues or all in one
does that help?
yee i want it all in one
so i just set gloabal to enabled
ty very much brother
do you know how to set up ranks when your already using mmr as a gate to verify people
i should be able to help you yeah
it auto sets roll from grand range for getting access to rest of server when they do /IGN
but then doesnt set the rank as well
which sucks cause i spent a while setting up all the rank roles to match the arena ranked system lol
well
i need to understand what youre saying bc you're not clear here
what role do you want to give to which people when they do what action
person joins server. types /ign and there name. it gives them a verificatoin role upon doing so (this is because i set that role to appear from -10000000 mmr to 10000000 mmr. referance in the reply.) I then also set up rank roles for actual MMR ranks to be auto assigned when a player hits that rank in the discord mmr system. but it is only setting the verificatoin role and not putting them on the starting rank role as well
you mind if i help you  in a call?
it's hard to explain
will be quite simple if i help while seeing what you're doing
Pretty sure the last role at the same mmr range u set will override the last one
So its like you just can have an autorole at once
by default, autoroles are exclusive, meaning if multiple overlap the condition the player will get the higher one
you can disable that when you add the role
`/autoroles mmr set only_one_allowed:False`
How do you make the que channels visible for a specific role? Cause it can only be seen by the admins and the players in the que
You can do that via server settings
This ones cause we need full admin roles to see it. If we dont have the full admin role it won't show up on their discord.
`/tempchannels permissions` you could also do this
all good now got it! Thank you
do you know how to make the /substitute command work?
Wdym? Is not working?
It should send a msg to the player
When I received yes/no I cannot accept it
Does work the same way as the /player sub command?
Player sub is admin only
It will force it
Hi guys! Anyone have a fix to this issue? I had a player predict NEGATIVE points, and I am unable to add points back under my name
any assistance would be ü•∞
yea i have a fix for preventing this from happening
youll have to manually set your points back
`/set points`
Hey, is there a command for maximum MMR to join a queue, so if the player has MMR above that, that can not join that queue?
So not allowing the higher MMR players queue with lower MMR players, I know there a minimum MMR to join queue
i guess not really
there is `/rolerequirement` if you have autoroles assigning roles
to restrict certain roles from joining
We do, thanks. I‚Äôll take a look at that üëç
ill look at adding a maximum mmr for that command too
that would be perfect if you could
Do you think this will be something added relatively soon or more complex?
its already added, just didnt send an update in <#910981294937210930> yet
`/mmr requirement `
Ahh nice, great work! üëäüèª
hello, when 10 players queue and a lobby gets created, a temp channel is created and it requires all 10 players to join the channel in order to start the picks and the bans.
do you know how to disable this feature ?
disable the channel, or make it not required?
do you know the command for making it nor required ?
`/lobbychannel toggle toggle:Enabled` and /`readyup mode disabled`
Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
i ended queue with out saving it
how do i undo it üò¶
by accident
<@648635725964902411>
Just load it again
It drops a code when u end it
`/config load`
it didnt
when you use /endqueue it should
it didnt
not sure then, it always saves a config when ending the queue
i got it
it was deleted
not ended
huh?
Probably deleted the queue message
He just needed to type in the channel
yeah haha

Hello. Which command need to use to cancel my /srartqueue?
/endqueue
Questions about AIPMK config (Pro City). I understood how to use it but... How to choose winner after the game? Buttons with nicknames are not clickable. 
Created voice and txt channels will be deleted  or i need to delete it manually?
we prob wont know abt specific configs, since anyone can make them and share them, but ill load it and see whats the winner selection
i see, that config has it set to select winners after 20 minutes
you can change that via /timer winnervotemessage
yea the pro city config had it very delayed
since its for valorant matches
Thank you! I appreciate it
is the api down? <@145305657237700608>
getting 404's on requests
no, 404 would mean the api is up
404 means youre making an error when u call the api
500 error would be diff
I set the MMR change to 25 and its giving 53
queentry channel command? i set the vc and join but it does not add me to the que
or it doesn't do it with me cause I have higher role then the bot?
did you change the `/queueentry methods`
oh okay, is it possible to have both buttons and vc?
lol nvm i got it... didnt see the either.. THANKS MAN!
im not following
I need to figure out how to set up a 5 team mmr system. 1st gets 30mmr | 2nd gets 15 mmr | 3rd Loses 5 mmr | 4th loses 15 mmr | 5th loses 25 mmr
that‚Äôs not possible currently
damn
is there any way that could come in a future update? Tarkov arena 2v2 shootout works of that system and it becoming a bigger comp scene
yea it‚Äôs a highly requested feature, just haven‚Äôt had time to do it
does anyone know how to change this back to what it was originally? i used / serverstats channelnames players, not knowing what it was
<@145305657237700608>
you're not giving enough details as to what happened
hard to help you
he wanted to remove the updating of the channel names
/serverstats channelnames players    removes it
When a player clicks the stats button, what is the api request for that?
there isn‚Äôt an exact match
all the data could be sourced from the leaderboard and individual stats, but theres no api for the exact stats info shown in the command
/api/matches/{server_id} is giving internal error, any advice?
hmm no, i‚Äôll try and check it out later today
Can I DM you bud?
Whats the error it gives
It just says internal error?
yea internal server error is all it would ever spit out
It works for me
i‚Äôve got it though, seems to break when you fetch matches while a setup is in progress
Is there an option for the players to vote to cancel queue?
yes /cancel
Is there an option to include a cancel button?
[player1] [player2] [cancel]
Do you have any tips to get the queue automatically canceled when an opponent is unresponsive?
that‚Äôs a good idea, not currently though
use /readyup if you don‚Äôt already
I‚Äôll try that
How does the /readyup work exactly?
Like, how would it get the match automatically canceled if someone doesn‚Äôt show up?
it will cancel if someone isn‚Äôt ready
Awesome
Can the vote to tie button also be  like a cancel button?
If someone doesn't join the call to confirm the queue, how can I have the bot automatically replace them with someone with the same role?
Not possible rn
it‚Äôs actually re-enabled
so it should automatically grab a new person
Did u announce that or no
Or im blind
the fact that it‚Äôs now enabled again
no i didn‚Äôt say anything üôÇ
is `/captains firstpick` the mode where captains can select players for the team ?
`/captains firstpick` is to choose a condition that if a captain meets, it will be the first to choose a player
whats the cmd for picking players for the team
How do I link the statuses of two different queues?
When there is only one Queue running, the normal status appears
When u start the queue you have the options for team selections
If u just want captains, do /teamselection set, and only choose captains
I think I changed it
But when I start another one this message appears "No queue found!
If you want a queue on this channel, run `/startqueue` or `/setup`!
If you want to control a specific queue for this channel, use `/link`!"
status?
Wdym status
Are u ending the queue and starting another one everytime or what
They are working together
But when I start 2nd, the statuses no longer work
Shows this
The one above is when there is only one working, then when I activate the second row it stops working
But what are u doing
I dont understand
You have a queue
In that channel?
I have two queues
Two queues in different channels
I need both of them to have a shared MMR
You can do that by naming the queues the same
Do I need to redo the Setup process?
Or just loading the settings?
Why am I loading the settings but it's not working?
The list is created but the mmrs are not shared
You can just do /queuename to rename the queue that u want to have the stats
If queue 1 is X, queue 2 will be X, and that queue will have the stats of queue 1
Queue 2 stats will be loose
Do u want to keep queue 2 stats and merge them with queue 1? Or you just want queue 2 to have the stats of queue 1
I want to merge the two
There will be two queues for different people but the rankings will be the same
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
Any versions of the queue where teams of 2 can queue but only queue with certain mmr levels?
or teams ?
at all
How to not allow player in a game to que up while ghe game hasn't finished yet?
how can i set a special points system for all queues?
ive 5 queue but
a different point system is used in each
for example if i have 1200 points in queue A
i have 1100 points in queue B
<@648635725964902411>
Configs are for each queue, u just have to set the point wins or losses in each queue differently
`/requeue condition`
how can I make ./ commands only available to certain people?
<@648635725964902411>
<@145305657237700608>
plz stop pinging people every time you have a question
sryy
you can hide commands via the Server Integration settings
thx a lot
is it possible to use this on this channel
or is it only on the queue channel?
the message tells you what command you need to run
"if you want to control a specific queue from..."
Do I have to activate it with some command? because didn't grab a new person, just cancel the queue
people who are not in q can join the team 1 and 2 vc but this shouldnt be a thing right?
That shouldnt happen
Unless you have added spectator roles or staff roles or changed category perms
uh no i dont think so
like i made a tdm role
hey guys! hope everyone is doing well. quick question. I'm looking to enhance the overall "server experience" in my server by incorporating automatic leaderboard updates through webhooks.

Specifically:
- Is there a recommended method for setting up webhooks for NeatQueue leaderboards?
- Can you provide steps or documentation for utilizing webhooks for automatic leaderboard updates?
- How can we ensure the leaderboard auto-updates over a set duration?

As always, I appreciate the guidance to help improve my community <a:cheers:1058073497995321344>
leadearboard should update after everygame
are you making a custom leaderboard?
Oh that would be diff yeah
Didnt think of dat
Js wondering, is it possible to make another queue and connect it to the same leaderboard?

> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
I was wondering if I could add a 5v5 queue as well as a 3v3
Leadearboard are the stats, so you are linking stats basically
yeah
pre much
Super duper cool, but rq, is there a way to copy the same previous queue embed thing into another channel? or would it be easier to remake the whole thing and then connect both to the one LB?
you can use `/config save` and `/config load`
What happens to the game results tho?
Would both of the queue's results just go into the single channel ?
Since its the same config it would go to the same channel
Is there a way to seperate the results channels?
`/resultschannel `
ahh okay
super easy\
Likely your discord permissions are set up wrong for the categories
i have a question
the leaderboard no show me because need vote, i vote but that no found
Wdym vote not found
Hey am I missing the option is there a way for saw the queue pops and it comes up for them to select a winner to be put in another channel?
I have the results one in it's own channel for admin over ride but if the queue is popping off makes it slightly harder for players to scroll up through the chat to select winner
the winner message should stick to the bottom
Hmm guess I will have to see it was a feedback some people had but if it is all we can do thaen it is all we can do
Hey - i'm a not so tech savvy person trying to set up a queue for the group I play age of empires with. I'm trying to fumble my way through it - but if anyone is able to help me figure it out...faster....lol I would really appreciate it!
So I've been having a problem in my server that I'm curious if anyone else has any solution for.
The problem is that new players (who are often times far less skilled than returning players) are valued (mmr wise) at the same level as players who are returning players. This is especially noticeable at the start of seasons where everyone has the same mmr. Right now players have played a bunch of games in the season, and when a brand new player joins, the bot values them at a higher mmr than what is usually their skill level, causing more unbalanced games. Setting the starting mmr to a lower value could work in the middle of the season, however it would end up not changing anything once a new season starts.

So the question is, is there any way to have a proper season reset with the bot where it sets the player's mmr in relation to his old mmr, not just the baseline? Or is there a way to ensure brand new players get a lower mmr rather than the same as returning players?
If anyone gives a suggestion please ping me so I see
if you are using autoroles, you could give every role a different starting mmr?
also depending on how you do your resets, you could set everyone to the same MMR but have the starting MMR be lower
like starting mmr 1000, but set everyone's current rating to 1200
similarly, you could decrease everyone's MMR by 200 instead of doing a flat out reset
feel free to ask any questions you have in here
So this is what it looks like
If we are having a few matches pop off I feel like it will be harder to find the results
oh, you should enable `/tempchannels toggle`
having multiple matches in the same channel is very messy
Ohhh I misread what that does entirelly
We typically run queues with 2 teams of 11 people and when captains pick they see player names in a blue box at the bottom beneath the listing that they can click. We tried increasing it to 5 teams of 11, but when we did the blue box was gone and so captains couldn‚Äôt click names to draft. Is there another way to select who is picked besides that box, or a setting to make sure that blue box is always there?
you can type the player name / number
with 55 players, its not possible to send 55 buttons
Is there a way we can setup decay so it starts after for example a month and every other week after that it decays a person's elo with 5%
not currentky
Also when I disable /lobbychannel pullall
it still drags
to the lobby channel?
The setting works it drags people who got a game from all channels to that queue channel
but when I disable it
it still drags them
it drags them from all voice channels to the lobby voice channel with the setting disabled?
wdym with the lobby voice channel?
the queue voice channel
yea it still drags them even if it's disabled
i just tried and it didn't drag, so im not sure
I mean it's not the end of the world
but it just keeps doing it
whats ur config
saved under KPC, it's normal PUGs
<@145305657237700608> I could just be stupid
does it still drag from lobby
even with the setting disabled?
from lobby to team voice channels?
yes, that is unrelated to the lobby channel pull all
ok my bad then
I'm stupid
no worries
One of our players decayed under an mmr autorole limit and his role didn't get changed
hmm seems its not updating on decay
will fix
is there a way to see all the maps you added to neatqueue?
`/info` on page 4
where is that
sorry?
where can i find /info on page 4
use the command /info
Im trying to vote to access the leaderboard and I literally cant it keeps asking me to disable adblocker and i already have it unblocked
try a different browser, or incognito?
Nothing works
Unless u give me like an actual browser for me to vote and get access to leaderboard
you dont have any other browser?
what happens if you click It's Disabled
it just directs me to authorize discord access
and does nothing
I did opera
safari
google
nothing
is there anyway you can give us manual access?
<@145305657237700608>
done
Is there a command to activate when one person does not enter the queue would be replaced by the next person?
no thats on by default
thanks
what is the ranking system for neat bot ? ELO ?
What exactly does "in the system" mean? The amount of players that come through and use the bot at some point?
yes, they have some sort of stats stored for any queue
wdym
its based on the elo system yes
Perfect, thank you very much!
Is there any way to wipe/clear this?
you could give an autorole games for people with 0 games, then reset all stats for that role
how to fix this there are no mmr changes
did they disable mmr
I just happened with this one matchj
what does the result message look like
I'm struggling to find how to reset a specific role. I found the command for resetting a player (`/managestats reset player`), but I haven't been able to find the command for a role.
that‚Äôs a good point, only /set and /add allow that‚Ä¶.
i guess i don‚Äôt have a great solution atm, i can take a look at adding it
No biggie. I appreciate it, though!

Run this to make sure they didn't vote to disable the MMR:
`/mmr change allow_disable allow_disable:False`

We had that happen a few times in the beginning of our server before we realized what was going on.
** **
Or check page 3 of `/info` to make sure your MMR change has a value. These are ours, for reference
whenever i make team selection to captains and i start a q and join the vc, nothing happened
happens
it only works if i don‚Äôt have team selection picked
the queue channel just does nothing when i have captains selected
anyone know y
you need more than 1 player
to do captains
ohhh
that‚Äôs why
i force started it for a test run
thanks
yea it doesn‚Äôt like that lol
I have also just started having this problem today
And this message is different
same cause
Hey, I tried to search in discord here but couldn't find it, is it possible to clear only registration data? I want players to be forced to reregister their game MMR
How do I make a certain role be pinged/notified when someone joins the que?
not possible
`/set ign`
I'm attempting to batch remove registration from 100+ people, would this do it for all or I would have to individually
you can specify the role
Oh Great and Wonderful NeatZ, how do you setup your precious bot, so that in a specific channel, it automatically starts a queue and when the match is ongoing, it starts a new one immediately after?
Like when a match is created, it creates another match immediatly?
Oh I see it empties itself
Match starts -> queue clears
Is there a way to put the queued people in a thread
`/tempchannels type type:Threads`
Or a separate channel?
You can put matchs in threads
Perfect
I currently have a racing server, is there a way to make a queue for multiple players and no teams?
you can set the teamsize to 1, and treat each player as a team
I did that, but there were 2 issues: -
1. It would create a new voice channel for each player
2. At the end of the match it would ask who was the winner, but the placement of the other racers was not considered
you can disable team voice channels with `/voicechannels teamchannels`
you cant do anything else besides pick a winner unfortunately
Oh, I see, I might have to try finding a new bot then, thanks for the help tho
Hmm, I ``/set ign account:none role:[role all users have]`` but it seems that they aren't required to register again still
–ø–æ–¥—Å–∫–∞–∂–∏—Ç–µ –∫–∞–∫ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥—É /startqeue –Ω–µ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –¥–ª—è –∞–¥–º–∏–Ω–æ–≤
if they have stats already, they wont be required to register
well, are you using /requireign ?
I'm setting /regquireregister, I'm basically attempting to have them re-register to re set their MMR
ah, yea you would need to wipe everyone's MMR
`/managestats reset mmr`
would resetting their MMR also reset their requireregister?
there's some glitches with the prediction points leaderboard, there are people who make predictions and dont get a dm back about their loss or gain
and rn we have someone whos inactive at 1k
is there a chance we can get a more accurate leaderboard or is there something I set up wrong
if they don't get a DM could be the bot just cant DM them due to their privacy settings or whatever
what makes you think the leaderboard isnt accurate
some gained 400 and they arent popping up on leaderboard
accoding to their dms
did you refresh the leaderboard?
Hello, how will I make a /startqueue accessible to everyone, not just administrators.
i join to the question because /staffrole did nothing
you probably dont want people using /startqueue
usually staff will set up a queue config, but then the queue is running forever
wont need to start queue again
Im having the same issue right now. Before, you used to be able to vote and it fixes it. Now it doesnt go away. Ive voted already.
It's not going away. I even have top.gg subscription and it still won't go away.
The leaderboard doesn‚Äôt work
it works, but you may be doing it wrong
Same problem
Weird, i just voted and it works for me
anyone got the 8s bot learned?
<:hmm:1172617247320195123> huh
for call of duty
Wdym learned?
like does anyone know how to set up an 8s bot for call of duty
wont save my queue name and im stuck at the easiest part so im willing to pay for it üòÇ
You can just ask here what youre struggling with
Bot also has a quick guide
yeah i looked on the web at it but cant find the queue name
Wdym cant find the queue name
Did u run /setup?
like it wont save
when i go to rerun the queue its stuck on Player_name type or something like that
and yes
Are u running /setup eachtime or what
yes have to
but i dont want to do that everytime to run 8s
seen servers where it stays open
You shouldnt be doing that, when your queue set up is done you dont have to end the queue
Its just stays there
alright will start it back up thanks for the help boss
ya still not working. ive voted on 2 accounts. i have premium on one account. i cant check stats
iirc premium servers aren‚Äôt required to vote
so you are able to vote, but it‚Äôs not doing anything?
I voted, it said I need to wait 12 hours
i voted on a 2nd account, it went through same thing, and i cant vote for another 12 hours
ive basically voted twice. i even bought top.gg premium because i was annoyed, and it still doesnt work.
i‚Äôm not sure what topgg premium even is
i can manually unlock you in a bit
it says it allows you to remove ads and not have to vote every month
where does it say that
it‚Äôs not related to the bot at all btw
on top.gg website. and ya im aware
what‚Äôs your server ID
397503511920640011
do we have the option to limit the map reroll cycle?
not currently
/teamsize
you can't the queue will always empty itself to prep for a new match
it is just one queue
the top one is the result of using `/need`
it just shows a snapshot of how many people are needed
/teamselection and /captain selection
<@238314485474000897>
<@857633321064595466> premium
> ### How to get premium
> 1) Login at https://www.neatqueue.com
> 2) Click the Dashboard tab
> 3) Select your server
> 4) Purchase credits and/or select a plan
is it everyone, or some people
click the leaderboard title and see if it loads on the website
must be some config which is hiding everyone
whats your config, ill check
if you reset stats, you wont see anything on the leaderboard
its not starting a queue, its just making sure the message stays at the bottom
<@145305657237700608> Hey, is it possible to rig the bot so after a certain amount of time people lose points automaticlly?
you must have created a queue in those channels
use /endqueue
`/mmr decay`
you must have multiple queues still
Is this for not playing? Or is this even when people play?
it kicks in after a player has not played a game for the set time
So example just to make sure, If I set a timer for 24 hours and someone didnt play a game for 24 hours, he lose points right?
correct
Okey thank you!
<@145305657237700608> ^^
given the new `/autoroles streak` command, I want to configure my queue so a player w/ 10+ wins (specific streak) can receive a role. is this possible to do?
would this function properly? `/autoroles streaks set role: @BLML WINNING STREAK lower_value: 10 upper_value: 1000 only_one_allowed: false`

i am confused how i configure so it relates to streak-specific roles, opposed to all streaks
wdym?
like I want to config one streak for 10+ wins specifically, and another for 10+ losses
would i just make the params for one lower_value: 10 upper_value: 1000 and the other lower_value: -10 upper_value: -1000 ?
lower value would be -1000, upper would be -10
but yes, thats right
gotcha thanks as always! probably gonna run by with some questions regarding the button in a bit! psyched about the new additions! <a:cheers:1058073497995321344>
What‚Äôs the default mmr when you win and lose
Is it random
Or 50 every time?
It depends on users mmr that they are against
Yeah I know say you win more against a higher rank making sure it‚Äôs like that just on the default
Its like that
Quick question about creating a button. How do I configure the button to ping a specific role in a given channel? Would the command look something like this?

`/commandbutton create command:/autoping role`
You can just ping the entire queue, and autoping set when it hits a certain queue size but how it says `autoping` wouldnt be really a ping that gets trigger with the command button
It will just autoping
yea, there isnt any command to just send a ping
is there a way I can send a custom message instead w/ the button, while include the role ID in the message?
not with the bot no, thats getting into the realm of needing another bot
Yeaaaa all good I know another wayüòÇüëä
is there a way to view an active list of all current configed autoroles? I think I set the params wrong on a previous command since players are receiving dms regarding roles they shouldnt have gained
In `/info` it should appear, but im not sure if everyone of them
they should all be there
<:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
can i enable parties for only one queue?
yes `/partyqueue`
I'd like to change the way players vote for maps in my server, currently everyone just votes for the map they want to play, but I want to use map banning + random selection after. Problem is it doesn't display the map that gets selected till after the rest of the voting is done. One of the voting stages are for a weapon ban, most players ban a weapon based on the map that is being played, so not being able to see the map before the gun ban makes gun banning less useful. Is there any work around for this? IE. ban map, random map is selected AND dispalyed the the players, then the rest of the voting continues
hmm i guess not currently, if you do random selection for anything it only appears at the very end
I feel like this has been mentioned, but I can't seem to find it.
When a player doesn't join the VC and they're automatically replaced, can we make it for the bot to sub in the next person(s) in line for the queue, and not the person with the closest mmr?
not currently
that feature doesn't have a command but it probably should, theres no config for it right now
How do I ensure that there is no vote on whether they want that team or not and that the game starts all at once?
I have a problem with the leaderboard. I vote in the page but i refresh the leaderboard and that put wich need vote, is a bucle
were you able to actually vote
and with the same discord account
i would like to substract mmr from a player that joined queue but did not start a game with opponent, i'd like it to be exactly the points lost as if he lost against that specific opponent

so i'd appreciate it if i know the exact ELO equation üòÑ
I wanted to give a little background to my suggestion here:
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/911057745204105237/1202967005553234030

These 4 buttons are the ones we may use the most. The bot will, many times, leave a message after like "MMR for <@415301114817413133> changed by -29.0". Or maybe I add the ban list button, and want the buttons to post again after the ban list is posted.

I hope that clarifies what my suggestion means.
yup that makes sense
i like the setup üòÑ
Is the same account
But that is show me always wich i should vote
how to select the channels that the bot can move players to? Instead of automatically creating and deleting channels
Is there a way to turn off `/cancel`, or make it admin only?
We have idiots trying to cancel for idiotic reasons
Where can I request an API key for the web API? The link on the documentation doesn't work for me.
how to disable this
/webhooks generatetoken
/teamselection reshuffle
via server settings
Does it allow me to request data from a server I am part of or do I need to have a role?
any endpoint which requires the token, you must be staff in that server
otherwise you will get a Forbidden response
A friend of mine wants to have a twitch overlay where he can display his own current rank but he is not an admin on that server. Is that possible with the current API?
the API doesn't show ranks currently
it would only show their MMR
Is it possible to fetch that easily?
not in the current state not really, i don't keep track of the roles a person currently has
guess it would be nice  to make that info visible
Would be cool if the person could generate a self token to access their own data.
I will find another way for now. Thanks for the information.
i lied, you dont need staff for every endpoint with a token requriement
fetching player stats is public
you can fetch by just having a server id true
general speaking
yea honestly its not all very consistent
is there a command to give party queue less mmr if won and more if they lose ?
Integrations, I guess?
Good day, I cant find the command for allowing/disabling players to Multi-Queue
wdym multi queue
I believe a long while back there was a command to prevent people from queue'ing in multiple queue's at once
I cant find that one
that was a very long time ago yea
there is no toggle for that, people can be in multiple queues at a time, they will automatically be removed from all queues if a match starts
the only option is /requeue condition, which dictates when a player is allowed to requeue
Ah I didnt know that is automated, good like that üëç
you are an OG if you remember that command lmao
How do you set it up where it auto selects captains at random without a vote to do captains, bottom 2 etc and just rolls into team selection
Hi, I am wanting to integrate https://api.neatqueue.com/api/queue/channel_id/players ... Into a custom JS file. 

I am looking to grab the players within the queue (in order) to display them when live-streaming. 

But, when I test out the API endpoint and input my channel ID I am getting the following (Error: response status is 403) ... 

Could you please guide me on how to integrate with your API's or send me a guide / reference for integration?

Could it maybe be certain channel permissions that I need to setup to make this work properly?
Are u integrating the api key in the header?
I haven't yet... I was simply inputting my channel ID, then using the execute tab to see the response. I do now see the "Authorize" tab in the top right of the interface. I guess I have to generate an API key via the instructions located under "Webhooks" section in your docs first before proceeding with testing the endpoint?
Yes, you need the api key to test even on swagger
`/webhooks generatetoken`
Gotcha, I'll give that go first. Thank you!
<@648635725964902411> Thank you! That worked! I guess what confused me was how exactly to generate the API KEY, but I see now it is generated in Discord! 

Just another quick question... With the JSON response does it respond with the players (in order) based on their queue position? 

And if so would the response provide the most recent person in the queue first then work it's way down to the last person in the queue to have entered? Or is the response opposite? Thanks!
Hmm i never tried that, but i guess the last one will display as last one in json
Yeah, that would make sense. I'll make sure to do some testing to verify! Thank you so much for the prompt responses <@648635725964902411> Insane man. appreciate you guys, I'm excited to integrate your plugin into my Discord / Lives! üáº

How do I cancel required voice channels when people join queue
change your /readyup
leaderboard doesnt work
yea you aren‚Äôt the first to hit an issue, will have to check it out some more
Hello, I need help to buy the Basic Vip, I already recharged the 5 credits but I get that the server does not have enough credits
What‚Äôs the cmd to put the rating in the players nickname
Ratinginname
what is the maximum players for the bot
Depends on the plan u have
Free plan: 500 players
How do I make the leaderboard and stats use discord nicknames
should be /misc nametype
honestly not sure if it‚Äôs wired up everywhere
I have set it to nickname
But doesn‚Äôt work
Does the nickname refer to server nickname or another separate nickname
Or is it possible to display the ign form /ign
should be whatever name is seen in the server
Wait is that a per person setting or per server
The /misc nametype
queue setting technically
It is displaying my name using nickname but discord name for all other members
Then how?
they would have to rejoin queue
it won‚Äôt update existing stuff
I see
Let me try
How do I make it go back to the queue screen
strange
is that a new channel for the match, or the normal channel
It was in the queue channel
It deleted the old queue message
And replaced with this ready message
Can I manually force stop the match?
Also no queue specific commands are registering 
It just says there are no queues
Even for the leaderboard 
Is that normal when a match starts?
if you do /clearqueue in the channel, what happens
No queue
It prompts me to create a new queue
I did
did you use /endqueue ?
No queue
Same goes for all the other queue specific commands
i‚Äôm saying did you end the queue
I do not know if I did
I did type that specific command
Weather it actually ended the queue I don‚Äôt know
Cause it just says no queue found
if you had a queue in a channel at one point but not now, it must‚Äôve been ended
I ended up doing /managestats reset
And created a new queue
But the leaderboard is messed up now
cuz u reset the stats
I then joined the queue
It should now display the starting mmr right?
It shows a blank leaderboard for all other categories (peak mmr, streaks, losses etc)
But poop screen for mmr
what does this mean? ‚Äú/lobbydetails set message: ‚Äú
<@145305657237700608> I got the old queue back up working by /config load
Is there a way to list all the queues and to terminate a specific one?
Is there a way to auto pick who makes the lobby everyone joins too?
Is there a way to automate order of game modes? To certain spots the bot is configured to do?
G1 OBJ G2 Slayer G3 OBJ G4 OBJ G5 Slayer and the bot picks the maps for those modes
won‚Äôt show until you play a game, the poop screen is discord not loading the image though
you can use the /lobbydetails command for that
check the docs for an example
for gamemode order use /gamemode selection
Obj can be 4 different game modes though
That's my question is there any way to have obj based ganemodes on games 1, 3, 4 and have Slayer on games 2 and 5
But the obj is picked randomly
And slayer is ALWAYS 1, 3,4
hmm no i guess not
it‚Äôs either ordered, random, voted, or least frequent
Anyway in the future(I'll pay you somehow!!! lol) to have it edit the order somehow?
Example: 
Random(out of these modes), X Mode, Random(out of these modes),  Random(out of these modes), X Mode
Bc assuring a game type is always played is huge for the competitive scene
ngl that sounds very complicated to set up from a user perspective
anyone can cancel the match and sub a player and he doesn't have the staff role that i put it on the list <@145305657237700608>
neither /cancel or /substitute are staff commands
since they don‚Äôt force it, it requires multiple people to accept
/ player sub
/ outcome cancel
Naw it shows
you must‚Äôve changed the required games requirement
those are not accessible by default
only via staff roles
Why is it saying we have to vote for the bot to use the leaderboard embed?
Several of us have voted and it still gives us the popup
Or simply choose applicable modes
In a specific order
Some do or don't show up
Because people hate voting. And there are 5 game modes and game modes 2 and 5 are always slayer
Not having a way to make it where it's ordered to a degree makes people vote especially if there are more game modes then may he available because then you throw away a game mode. What if I like you a bot that does it?
Is there a way to make a specific role get a certain amount of MMR per win/loss compared to another role?
We cannot do any leaderboard type commands at all
cant check stats, etc.
What is the difference between mmr calculations per person and per team
If streaks and placement multipliers are turned off
<@145305657237700608>
<@648635725964902411>
Bruh
how do you make the bot autodrag to voice channels? and make the bot autodelete queuepings?
Thanks
But it was 2 am for me
i‚Äôll check it out today
yea i also like to sleep
I felt asleep at 11, im old <:sadcat:1179569615911800842>
will use the players MMR for calculating their MMR change vs using the teams average MMR
give them a /mmr multipliers
should auto drag players to their team VCs
Ok thanks
Sorry I meant like dragging them to the waiting queue vc?
`/lobbychannel set`
hey quick question when we randomize captains and press yes it starts up a new one to pick captains again. but when we press no it picks the captains  why does it do this?
read the question it asks
hello guys anyone with this problem?
we're picking one by one but somehow bot sets two mid in one team..
how were teams picked
how do you make it where you have to verify your ign before you can join the queue?
Is there a way to do map bans for valorant 10 mans
`/requireign `
`/map bans`
but do I have to add all the current maps for the bot to do map bans?
U just have to specify the number of bans, the bot already know the maps if u have them
gotcha
1-1-1-1
so captains?
Also i see that players are banned even when they're in queue channel before joining time ends
They might be joining late but they shouldn't be banned then, right?
üò¶ every time you try to interact or use /leaderboard to load the leaderboard in a channel
has anyone voted today?
We've tried, it wont let us
nevermind, just start working üò¶ sorry for wasting your time
no prob
i updated earlier today which should‚Äôve fixed any issues
Are there known issues with substitution at this point?
not that i‚Äôm aware of
For the name of the Temporary Setup Channels is it possible currently to have the name of that channel say the Team names playing? So like instead of saying ‚Äúqueue-284‚Äù it can say like ‚Äúteam1-vs-team2‚Äù
Or some form of that
unfortunately not since usually the teams aren‚Äôt created by the time the channel is
any how on how to delete a party ( as an admin ) that has been created by players
thanks in advance
you can use `/party disband` with the party name, as staff it will force the disband
thanks !!!
the bot can make an random password for each queue ?
Uhm no
`/lobbydetails set message:Password: PASSWORD8A`
same thing here
but we voted
how can you manage the order of picking the teams
for the captains
`/captains drafttype`
the bot can do it randomly ?

<@145305657237700608>
Have a guy in here messaging people wanted to let you know don‚Äôt know how you feel about people promoting there own bot in here
Well, sadly i dont think neatz or the server can control that <:Shrug:1171270284670668830>
Just wanted to let you guys know that‚Äôs all
<:PeepoHeart:1171269076971180042> <:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
‚ô•Ô∏è us over at select 11‚Äôs love the bot keep up the good work guys
NeatZ is the dev, so all cheers to him
thx, will just ban them
making a similar bot is fine, but not DMing people from this server about your own competing bot lmao
no problem can i reccomend for tickets get a ticket bot for future casue im sure there are more people in here doing it and if this is public they know who not to message
regardless i have no prob airing them love this bot
yea a ticket bot would be smart probably
Is it cool if I dm you about this?
I voted twice on the top.gg website and it still says I have to vote
How do I fix?
did you vote by clicking the button in discord?
I clicked the link and the button and it still says I have to vote
hello
recently added the bot to my server
but when 10 players sign up in que
it make a que of game #
but does not give captains to pick etc.. it says join a vc first
how to cancel the vc order...
`/readyup`
is there any kind of roadmap for the bot?
Documentation: https://docs.neatqueue.com/
Basic guide: https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
but no, there is no roadmap
i dont have any long term plans really which would require one
tryna get basic plan
aint working
its doing this weird thing where it shows 4.9999 credits as 5, need to fix, one sec
try now
cheers
i just bought another credit allg
<@145305657237700608> how do i add like a leaderboard
cuz i wanna do it in a specific channel
seperate to my other queues
but it keeps saying for me to /start queue but i just want it to where it posts the stats and leaderboard in
`/link` and then `/leadearboard`
cheers
it all seems to link up to the same leaderboard tho
as i wanna set it for diff things
cuz i wanna have 1 for 1v1s, 2v2s, 3v3s, 4v4s and 5v5s but it all just shows the same leaderboard no matter the queue name at the top
you can only link to 1 queue at a time
can I ask you a quick question
We are using your bot for a game called PSO we have a league, for pugs in NA but we couldnt find out how to make @captain role to @PUG
do you have any idea how to add this thing
so we want captain role to ping @pug
damn what....
shi bro
pls make it so we can do more than 1
`/captains role` (?)
so instead of this
we want this
only MODs can ping it currentl
currently
/link can only work with 1 queue at a time, otherwise it wont know which queue to reference
if people cant ping the role, you must have disable pings for it
we have them enabled
cant u customize if so it recognises it by each of their names?
this is PUG's perm
its a permission issue, its not related to the bot either
no, /link allows you to use any command as if you are typing it in the queue channel
it cant work with multiple queues linked
can ya help please ü•∫
we are using a bot that gives perm to certain people when they react the emoji
Do you think it's because of it?
because only mods can ping it
probably
but other roles cant
neatqueue doesnt do anything with user perms
do you have any idea how we can solve it?
whats the server id
you'll have to fix the permissions, thats all i can help
how can i see that?
hold on one sec, wanna check something
can u invite me real quick?
or just try voting again
yo neat so with my queue after captins are selected and yadayada how do i add a pannel bit where they can vote for a map to be played
`/map add`
i probably cant since there's a 12h cooldown?
okie
i have sent you the link
Hey btw we have a league in a game called PSO we are having a issue that says limit 500 members
can you extend that thing?
we have almost 800-900 people who plays pug
so 500 limit is not really working for us
if there is something you can do like removing the limit it would help us a ton
you would have to purpose premium like it says
alright so there is nothing you can do except buying the premium?
anyway thanks for your help.
right yea, you would need premium to exceed the 500 player cap for the free tier
Yeah we will get game dev to buy it no worries
<@145305657237700608> is it cool if I dm you about this?
sure
We have an active game with two teams, and the bot has just randomly deleted one of the two voice calls mid game
Any idea why that might've happened? <@145305657237700608>
im confused
It's weird because the queue is still active and the first vc is still there too
Nobody has voted for the winner either
do you have a bunch of games going on by chance
Quick Question:
Let's say I'm trying to set roles so that the #1 player is gold, #2-6 are silver, #7-18 are Bronze
But I don't want the #1 player to also have the silver role and the bronze role
What command would I use?
The other role commands seem to allow for upper and lower bounds, but /top players set doesn't seem to have this option
yea currently there is no way to achieve that, exactly the reason you said
command doesn‚Äôt have a lower and upper bound
needs to be added
kk, if it ever gets added please ping me
Thank you for making this btw
Anyone know any reason why players would not be able to rejoin the channel when captain picks are going?
is there a way to add Cancel game button next to reporting winners ?
anyway to see the leaderboard or scores without paying ?
Hello
can someone help me ?
You dont have to pay
You just have to vote
Can you help me ?

Altough i dont know if it can be display when a match starts in the q channel
Jst ask
Alright so , How can i give specfic role to be able to use command /startfromvc?
i mean permission
to specific role
Via server integration
what do you mean ?
Settings > integration
so can i make it automaticly starting
so i don't have to keep running this command always
anyone here?
Hey, I'm not getting my autoroles updates post-match? I have to manually update autoroles by sending a /autoroles mmr command
Ah no, thats not possible
So i can change player nick by their level ?
Please?
You can just set the mmr in their nickname
not sure if you are new to the bot, but that is usually not the "right" way to start a queue
but it is an option
whats a level?
I guess change nicknames based on MMR
I had waited upwards of an hour and it was not automatically changing roles, despite having it properly setting up when I forciblky updated a role using the /autoroles MMR command
But not display MMR actually, like if u get 400 in your nickname display [Gold] probably
whats your `/config save`
"/config save name:Tribes Testing "
i cant join queue
many servers
mw3 bpl
i cANT queue
This server is only allowed 500 players in the system. Please upgrade to premium to allow more players!
tell me this
login neatbot
Well, the server is limited by that then
i dont understand
how they are playing ?
and i cant play ?
its for that server's staff to figure out
Have u never played there?
reach out to the server's staff
The server has free tier wich allows 500 players
Players are not be able to see the match channel vc where captain picks are going on if they accidentally leave; but are able to join team vcs once teams are picked.
sounds like an issue with permissions on the category perhaps
Is there a way to set the certain permissions granted to each person in that queue match?
or only by role
The perms in the category is good.
So, in my server I have it set so that `everyone` doesn't have any permissions;
When the channels are created, the permissions are set correctly for the needed roles.
Then once all players have connected to the voice channel; the permissions of the VC reset and are defaulted to only `everyone`.
so what perm is missing
First Screenshot: Prior to all players joining
Second Screenshot: Once all players have connected
The bot has all the permissions necessary
thats the new voice channel?
did you disable channel restrictions ?
Yes, that's the Queue#$ voice channel
Enabling and disabling channel restrictions doesn't change this behavior
by default the bot gives players access, whats ur config
WALMB
yea enable channel restrictions and check
or use `/voicechannels permissions set role: permission: value:` for lower level control
I tried enablign channel restrictions just now and same thing,
permissions are set correctly when players are joining;
once all players in the queue have joined, it resets to a blank `everyone` only; with no perm modifiers active
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/1204842967987126312
is there a way to revert the result of a match if staff results channel was set to none?
i mean when you do /leaderboard , you get list of scores right ? , How can i autorename player server-nickname , to their level.
`/ratinginname format`
what do you mean i got
/ratinginname format format: location:
i want it , to be automatically changing Nickname to their level
Please someone can help.
<@145305657237700608>
Yea? Fill those parameters, then do /ratinginname toggle
i mean if i have 1000 points i got [1000] BossRank
in the server nickname
yes?
How can i do that
Im telling you...
/ratinginname format, and /ratinginname toggle
Read the params desc of thw first one
....
with this command /ratinginname format , What should i type there to keep show up their level in server-nickname
<a:TE_PepeAgony:861842022821658684>
If u enable it, it will get auto updated
at last it show nothing lol
Did u run /ratinginname toggle?
yeah and the names still samething
Have u read what it says when u run the cmd
i have to queue to get the level on my nickname?
Yes...
Altough it wont display anything if youre the creator of the discord server
Bot cant manipulate nicknames of discord server creator
so how to reset all stats to 0
for all members
`/managestats reset all` also mmr dont start from 0, if u want that do `/startingmmr` and set it to 0, then run the managestats reset
Anyone?
you cant if u didnt have a staff channel
I mean you can revert everything by hand, but it will be more work
you can use `/outcome`
youre a legend
thanks
Oh you can use that even when the match is done
Didnt know it
How can i send matchs log to specifc channel ?
Setting up a /staffchannel
Quick Question
We're using this bot for a 1v1 queue similar to chess and I'm just testing it for tomorrow
I did /requiredvotes winner: Two
But it seems to only require one vote
Is there a command that I can run to require both players to have to vote on the outcome?
thats the right command, did you use it before the match was made
But I get "1 more vote required!" in the channel
Been messing with this for 15 minutes and I'm stumped
Logs show:
/requiredvote winner type:2
Success: Used by franklynathan at February 7, 2024 8:58 PM
are u in test mode
Okay, I joined with another account and turned off test and it works
yea test mode is always 1 vote
Got it, thank you again for respond so quick
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnV9UPP2-r9-Kz8Bjbn9ifpx7JWGi79jXGIt8CFvK60/edit
I made a quick doc explaining how to set it up in our server in case it's useful for others
Also if anybody has any suggestions for things I should do let me know
very nice!
<@145305657237700608> Bro this thing when we reply to someone or ping them they get picked, can we fix so that dont happen?
in a que
wdym
The captain choosing, do you remember, by typing
But that shouldnt be enabled by default
its actually always enabled
you can either click the button, or mention/send  their name
Any chance there's a way to edit the leaderboard so that it just shows MMR (and not W-L) when we pull it up?
Since Peak MMR doesn't show Win/Loss but just MMR does
I think it feels kind of bad for some of our players to see the win/loss be 2 wins 20 losses. It'd be better if it just showed the MMR
hmm yea that is fair
i dont think i can fully remove it, but could make a new panel for JUST mmr
That would be really nice, yeah
In team games it probably doesn't matter as much but in a 2D fighter I think it's discouraging to see 2-26 on the leaderboard next to your name
But just seeing a low ELO number doesn't have the same effect
Is it possible to dissable it? Our players are dumb And dont understand this
actually i think a command under /leaderboardconfig would work fine
Yeah whichever. If it gets added ping me to let me know!
<@145305657237700608> Is it possible to check if anyone used a command?
you can use /logs
I already set the auto roles for certain mmr, but I want to cahnge the mmr for those roles
If i just do the basic cmd should that work? or will it mix with the current autorole configuration
Howdy, my server is using NeatQueue right now for match making
and the bot deleted one of the bot made voice channels?
Anyone had this issue before?
?  did u setup the bot with temporary channels?
I don't believe so, this hasn't happened before
Im pretty sure these are temporary channels
they look like them
They should last the duration of the match though..?
Until a winner is selected
first theres the join queue vc which all players must join
once they all join then *that* vc deletes and teams get seperated into 2 diff VCs (team 1 & team 2)
once players finish the game and vote, it should automatically delete those team 1&2 channels
Correct
But mid match it deleted Team 2
Team 1 is still up, and all the players are still in VC
Some players reported this happened to them earlier in my server as well
They had to just use a different vc for their game
That's what they are doing right now, was just wondering if others had this problem or if it was my own mess up
Thank you <3
Yeah np, seems like a new bug but it only happened once to us
If you have an in game role you could set up a temp channel that only in game players can see, that way they always have a safe VC if something were to happen
is there a way to see history on points and mmr ?
cuz you can change it and itll say youve changed it to whatever but not by how much
yea a few people have reported voice channels being deleted accidentally, will have to investigate
could u explain more
like so i just got banned on a server for tamper with leader boards when i went all in with around 1700 points and ended up with 3100 points or so and i changed my mmr and points but there isnt any history of that happening basically and i didnt put that in logs ig but there should be history though wouldnt there
there isn‚Äôt a way to view history of points
besides command usage in /logs
do you have to manually log your cammands ?
commands
`/logs` will show the commands used
Thats just automatic, like all logs
i know that but it doesnt show what it was before i changed it
it will only show the exact commands used
that‚Äôs the best you can get
damn ok
So im assuming Team 2 - #21 is the channel that should not have been deleted
could you give me your server name or ID?
I can check the reason why it was deleted (for some reason, Discord doesn't show deletion reasons in the audit log)
Outlaws Esports
Correct
any idea how long the channel existed before being deleted?
a minute, 15 minutes, etc
About 15-18 minutes ish
It moved them at 8:09 to the VCs, then deleted it at 8:26
ok thanks
I already set the auto roles for certain mmr, but I want to cahnge the mmr for those roles 
If i just do the basic cmd should that work? or will it mix with the current autorole configuration
<@145305657237700608>
you can just use the same command and it will overwrite the config
like with /autoroles mmr set
how do i make it so that it doesnt private message a person?
could anybody help me with setting up a custom 8s queue for call of duty please? i have next to no clue what im doing with bots lmao
`/matchstart dmplayers `
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
quick question: how to use /ratinginname format
The $ indicates the mmr
If u do [$] it will be [1342]
Suffix is after nickname, preffix is beforr nickname
so how can i set the default mmr to 0
so ppls should grind from 0
Hello ?
`/startingmmr set mmr:0` then `/managestats resetall`
Stop pinging
You need to do that with a running queue
everytime ?!
how can i set it to default 0 mmr when joined the server
and player can reach 5 points when won the game
and lose 10 points when lose the game
Just once when u create the queue, u config it
i always do /startfromvc <vc name>
but i have to run this command everyitme ? when i create a queue ?
If you use that command youll need to run it everytime
how can i create permant queue from text and in 1 channel ?
./queuestart?
Just create the queue
how to set how many mmr you get per win and per lose?
`/mmr change set `
huh ?
it show statsic and loser?
so if i do /startqueue , it will be permant?
is this still working, whats wrong?
nvm its working now
weird
Can neatqueu change a person name? I want players to have a custom icon in their name once they reached a certain mmr
would there be a way to make a captain banned permission or something?
also would i be able to give my hosts specific commands like /sub so they dont have powers to use /add mmr
you can set up a /staffrole and add specific command permissions to it
`/staffrole command allow`
would i be able to have 2 different tiers of it?
regular hosts can sub the others can use mmr stuff
Is it possible to have an unranked queue so that I can set up a system that blocks people from playing unless they have 5 unranked wins
You could setup 2 queues, Unranked and Ranked. In the unranked queue you can set an autorole when someone has 5 wins, and for the ranked queue only allow players with the 5 win role to queue. I think /roles is what you'd use for that. I'm pretty sure I've seen a way to disable or at least hide mmr, but you'd have to look at docs for that
that sounds good
if you have experience doing that please could you dm me
My server doesn't have an unranked queue, but it shouldnt be that hard to setup. Reading the docs will help you https://www.neatqueue.com/
We have automatic roles set up, but they don't seem to be working. Is there anything that I can check for this?
new setup or existing?
It was first noticed 2-3 days ago. It's kind of hard to catch, so it may have been going on longer than that
is there a captain banned type permission ?
when you say not working, is it sometimes roles don‚Äôt update?
wdym
Yes sir, that's correct
a role that people cant vote for captain
in my community there are a lot of dumb players who get picked captain because of trolls or others who dont like picking people
You could give select people the captain role, then make it random so it only picks from that pool of pre-selected captains
yea there isn‚Äôt any banned captain role currently
is it for everyone, or specific people you noticed?
wait wait theres a captain role where it selects those with the role?
yes /captains role
I haven't noticed. I'll make our team aware and try to keep a log or something to narrow that down
appreciate it, also note you can run /autoroles refresh which will manually rerun all the calculations
if that doesn‚Äôt fix anything, then it‚Äôs some other issue
Is there a way to make the temp channels that appear for matches visible to everyone instead of private for just the players involved?
channels just break out of nowhere all the time
disappear
team 1 consistently just disappears
again
for the 4th time tonight
out of how many games?
When the queue is created, anyone can see the queue text channel.
Can we make only certain role to be able to see the queue text channel?
Looks related to category settings, or maybe u disabled channel restrictions
But you can do that via category settings
would there be a way to make it where the people with the captain roles are the only ones that can be voted?
thats the current behavior
as long as there are enough players with the captains role
ohhh
bc i only had 3
it made it random?
i see
THANK YOU
@neatz 10 out of 15-20 even the first one just now we are not being pulled into lobbies and have to manually move in
let me restart
How do I remove test mode from infront of the queue name, i typed / test again and it said test is finished  but its still sayign Test mode at the top
just type something to refresh the msg
its disabled
i tried that, and it popped back up with same thing
apologies, tried it again and it works. thanks
<@145305657237700608> just happened in the first series right now. the VC just broke and disappeared
what did
<@145305657237700608> vc disappeared
been happening for days but ridiculous now
what was the channel name
<@145305657237700608> https://discord.com/channels/1140190171191582752/1179913683086884964 this is the lobby
and it sets into eagle and cobra teams
this time was cobra
but it changes
one or another
what channel was deleted though
the name of it
should be in the audit log as well
Cobra - #1301
it says it was deleted since it was empty
im assuming it wasn't
probably related issue to when the bot accidentally bans people who are actually in the VC, its seeing outdated info
ill just disable that deletion \
The servers are overloaded, so it doesn't move people?
Hey if i enabled balance by mmr, it still uses the pick option..
Its set matchmaking
Config: TXJJE
you want `/teamselection`
lmk if you see any more issues
hopefully its fixed
How do i upgrade to premium to allow more than 3 queues?
How do you set so more than one person has to set which team won? also can you do it by map or is it always just who won the series?
<@857633321064595466> premium
> ### How to get premium
> 1) Login at https://www.neatqueue.com
> 2) Click the Dashboard tab
> 3) Select your server
> 4) Purchase credits and/or select a plan
<@145305657237700608> will do
it‚Äôs always the series
but by default it‚Äôs a majority vote unless you are in test mode
Is this why this happens? I've been scratching my head on it
yes, it‚Äôs not an issue with your config or anything
hopefully i solved it
@neatz is there a way to change a name of the queue without losing stats to it?
i just had someone move from 31 to 20
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
^ this is how u can control the queue stats
option 1 or 2 is what u want
i might need a walkthrough
im afraid
unless you run /managestats reset, there‚Äôs no risk to losing anything üôÇ
im breathing heavily lmfao
use option 2, select the old queue name from the list, and refresh the leaderboard
you should see the same stats, then u can freely change the queue name
so i already changed the name
so we should still be good
ok ill try
<@145305657237700608> anyway i can pay you to help me reset the ranks
i have 5 divisions now and want  to situate it accordingly
but it might take forever
alone
unfortunately i‚Äôm busy rest of the day so can‚Äôt help out
like for example, i have ranks scaling to 75 in each area but want to make 1 overall rank
anyway to make this happen easily?
like u wanna remove the ranks?
if there are 5 different queues with their own names
? and also do you have time this week?
i want to re orient ranks
for example, div 1,2,3,4,5
have 0-75 in each of them
so in each thing itll be 0-75 in after somones name
but i want to scale it to where ut is 0-250 server wide
and each queue can only be joined if they hit a certain level
50/100/150/200/250
Just adjust that with mmr requirement
Or role too
Role would be better for that case
right but roles are set to many of the members already
i have to redo every single role
I have roles on members so they could start "higher" in the discord
or at least in line with their csr in actual ranked
to a degree
so they arent stomping players for 50 games
is there a way to remove the roles and again just reset everyone to flow all the queues together
What are trying to do
Reset everything?
I think i might have to :/
i need help
bc ive built this from months of trial and error
but the ranks and roles were situated to what i didnt know what it would become
so now i need to make a new divsiion and i want to splice/combine all the queues together with their own names that you earn your way into
Well, if u have the roles made with autoroles, you can just reset the autoroles mmr, for every role and it will remove them from the user
i persoannly would give roles w/ other admins to ensure consistency and honesty
statring mmr set is what i used
<@648635725964902411> how do i make it where we connect all the queues?
In wich sense?
like <@648635725964902411>
0-10 can play in DIV 1
10-20 DIV 2
20-30 DIV 3
30-40 DIV 4
40-50 DIV 5
And as they increase in rank they can move in or out of each division
automatically, while also gaining roles asnd losing them as they win and lose thier rank (gives them a picture next to their name)
`/autoroles` r for that
But you basically want them to share mmr aswell
right
every division "shares mmr"
as it fluidly changes from one rank to the next
If youre planning to do a reset of everything you could just name every queue the same, it will automatically reset stats aswell
But not sure if u want to reset?
wdym
and i dont mind resetting
"you could just name every queue the same"
<@648635725964902411> wdym
like make a new queue?
and name them the old name?

NeatZ send this aswell, the first one works as naming all the queues the same, meaning it will share stats
So what i get of all, is that you want, 5 queues that will share stats, each queue will have its mmr range to play right?
but named different <@648635725964902411>
Yep, first command will allow you to name them differently but share stats at the same time
https://tenor.com/view/don%E2%80%99t-make-me-beg-gif-18284150441593567102
can you talk <@648635725964902411>
for like 3 min
I cant really right now
Ok ok
I understand
I can tomorrow maybe, but shouldnt be difficult to set up
if all the queus have difff roles that give different starting mmr sets do i need to delete them all
Whatever time i will make it happen if possible
If youre going to use the same roles you just can change the starting mmrs
right
So rn, you have 5 queues?
<@648635725964902411> just added a new one
so its not associated atm
need to though
what do i do to get that done, could i just do another queue named the exact same as a previuous and then rename it
Just do startqueue and name it the same
what if i want to keep almost all of the edits ive made to a previous queue?
or do i need to manually do that for this one
<@648635725964902411>
Save the config and load it
gotcha
then i reload it?
`/config save` `/config load`
rename *
If u load it, it will load with the name of the queue
That was saved
ahh. can i rename it after now
`/queuename `
got it
now i do what to server blend mmr? and should i do something prior to that?
<@648635725964902411> will everything change as soon as i share stat it?
<@145305657237700608> ? ^
Idk what to do haha
Your queues are brand new, idk what do you mean
You still have the first 5?
ahhhh see thats where i was confused
ok ill make multiple queuss
<@648635725964902411> yes i have the original 5
i have to make new ones then? <@648635725964902411>
or can i keep them just edit??
Bro i cant figure what u trynna do
If u dont mind resetting stats just make it server wide
And then reset stats
<@648635725964902411> it didnt reset stats
it did for some people but do i have to go queue to queue?
what command did you use
managestats reset mmr
and i actually looked at it now it looks like it only does one at a time?
is it bugged?
Hi there! I'm getting this error when our match is full:
The bot has the manage channels permission enabled in the channel and category it is in
I'm sure I'm just missing something simple but can't figure it out
wdym one at a time
did you specify a queue name?
Yes I did but I wanted to reset all stats server wide <@145305657237700608>
then you shouldnt specify a queue name lol
if you specify a queue name, it will only reset stats for that queue
It's doesn't let me
It shakes the screen
It forces me to specify a queue
oh gotcha, yea thats messed up then
Ok update me when it's fixed üîß?
Unless you can do it from your end for me
i can update in a bit
you could just reset each queue name, its the same thing
Even if they're all connected?
(server-wide)
when you do `/managestats reset mmr queue_name:`, all the names that pop up are the unique names where stats are stored
Right but now I want to connect them
and reset all stats?
It should be fine right?
Connect them as in the mmr from now on
huh?
So when I reset them all and have mmr server wide
The mmr won't be separated after another reset
Any idea on this one <@145305657237700608>

I managed to find a work around for that, but I am not having the winner vote pop up when the queue pops
Do I need to enable that somewhere? Or set the channel that it gets sent in?
that is related mostly to the bot not being able to send embed links or messages
anyone know a fix?
Its just restarting globally...
Ok, is there an ETA
When it says online
Does it take a few minutes or like an hour?
Its up :]
it usually takes like 15 seconds
hi, i buyed 5 credits and i add the bot on my server, but when i try buy the premium say me "
Please invite NeatQueue to your Server"
how do i reset leaderboard in my server
`/managestats reset all` To reset leadearboard you need to reset the stats
Here it says, hello, you just bought US$ 4.51 at WWW.NEATQUEUE.COM. The purchase was made using international credit, with final card 0487
whats the server name
Golden Knights
can you help me?

you purchased credits without the bot in the server i guess
ooh, okay, thanks for the suport! have a good night!
np, thanks for alerting me of this issue
the queue was just gone
and idk why
i started it again now with the command but why could it delete itself
<@145305657237700608> can u help me, the queue got deleted for nothing, i put it again now, now it has 1 voice channel and banning people from the queue, how do i disable this.
its not the teamchannels
does anyone know how to run a test and go through each step of the process individually without the need of various other people to start the queue
<@648635725964902411> got a min?
sorry for the ping
`/test`
Just dont ping when u need help
It wont make me read it
That looks something i cant really investigate about
Maybe someone deleted the queue message
The autoban sometimes bugs out
but yk how to disable voice channels?
and that its banning people from queue if they dont join the vc
i got it
ready up mode
I voted for the TopGG thing but i still cant access the leaderboard
alr everything got reseted
i need to setup everything again

got it working, thank you!! i'm sure this was answered a lot of times but how do we have the "join queue" and "leave queue" buttons?
That should appear by default
Any changes you have made?
Could be related to permissions aswell not being able to display those buttons
im tryinf to do normal queue, this is all i see! if it's perms related i can definitely change something!
Oh yeah, thats related to permissions
Check out embed links or messages perms
embed links was it! thank you so much!
<:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
is there a way to log who votes who
people do troll votes
and we get trash captains and it ruins the game
This is an issue that is still happening for us. People in the VC are randomly getting queue banned. Most of the time, it's all 22 people. Is there anything on our end that I can do?
hmm no, i would just disable auto bans
Dang. We will just deal with it then. When we disable it, too many people would leave the queue because they didn't like the people they queued up with, so we would rather still punish who dodge and just unban everyone when this happens.
Actually, could there be a bug? It's done it 3-4 times now in the last 20 minutes
yes its a bug, i just dont know why
It does it for every queue atm. It's not recognizing that anyone has joined VC, so it ends it. We aren't able to do anything because of it
y has next q been so ass for the past 2 days
it says its about to restart
been doing this for awhile
hmm it is taking a while
Status says server is up and healthy however we are getting these errors in our server. Any known fixes?
its back now
ty ‚ù§Ô∏è
IT'S WORKING. YOU'RE THE MAN
oh itll break again, restarting the bot fixes it, who knows for how long though
Do you think using the Ready Up button instead will fix it?
theres a good chance since it wouldn't rely on receiving voice state updates from discord
Thanks. I'll try it for now

bro, i destroyed my whole server with trying something, i just started anothere queue with same name, i think all ranks and all stats for everyone are gone, can i get my old things back? any way?
im not sure whats going on
i could be wrong
If u didnt reset something, a new queue with the same name should have the stats the old queue have
im not sure what i did, but everyones mmr is reset
i didnt use the reset commnd
only start queue
If u changed the name it would work as a reset, but setting the old name of the queue should work
i changed it
just 1 to 2
no way thats it

Hello, I'm new and I'm interested in esye bot to do a great project. If someone would be so kind as to explain to me how to do it, someone who speaks Spanish can explain it to me by DM
Weird question, I have lobbies/queues separated for regions, however, so as to not crowd the server (for mod POV), I'm wondering if there is a way to combine ex. EU and NA into one lobby/queue, but still have them join separate matches. So a match wouldn't start until 12 NA players joined, even if there were 12 members in queue (x amount EU).
where is the differense between Snake (1-2-2-2) and Straight (1-1-1-1), i dont rlly know what that means
<@857633321064595466> snake
That command does not exist!
if you have two teams, the pick order for snake would be

Team 1, Team 2, Team 2, Team 1, Team 1, Team 2, Team 2, etc
straight would be 

Team 1, Team 2, Team 1, Team 2, etc
what pick order, picking a team before starting the match?
or is it only for teams over 1 person?
Those picking orders belong to captains mode
A captain will draft, based on the type u set, before starting the match
does 'gamenum' mean 7877?
and is possible to sub a player after a queue has ended?
before the match winner is picked, yes
not after that
damn
why not
it doesnt really make sense to sub someone after a match is completed
but the better reason is i never implemented it
we voted the winner team too fast and I hadn't time to sub during the game
you can manually adjust the stats to fix it
yeye that's what i'm doing
<@819744133240324096>
Is it possible to change the server  icon if someone is in the Que? That way people can see if there‚Äôs people looking for games without always being on the server!
interesting idea, but no not possible
i imagine that its not even possible to update the server icon very often
Dang, that‚Äôs unfortunate. Would be cool if it was possible
there is a similar feature with `/channel name`
but its not great cuz it cant update very fast
What does that do?
Nvm, I already have that set up on my server! 

‚ùå have this when empty
‚úÖ this when someone is looking
Is it possible to setup role priority by any chance? any help would be appreciated
role priority in what sense?
as in, players queue; and when the queue is ended the bot will attempt to fill players for the highest role first, if the match is still not full then the second highest and so on till the game is full
are you using the matchmaking queue type?
No, but if thats the easiest to set it up in I'm willing to use it
I believe I have PUGs set up rn
just trying to setup a valorant inhouse system on my server
if its PUGs, then priority won't matter, it will always start when enough players are in queue
Ohhh truee; and if its matchmaking? how would I be able to do it there?
in matchmaking people with priority goto the front of the queue so they get a higher chance at being in the match
`/requeue priorityrole add role:`
OHH! Thank you so much, I appreciate the help :)
oh btw is there a way for me to delete my old config?
you can end a queue, but cant actually delete a config
they live forever
ah what a shame
welp once again, thank you for your time and help, I appreciate it
is there a way to make 10 captains
if you do 10 teams sure
How do you make 10 teams
`/numberofteams`
How do you hide names whenever someone joins a team?

And team 2 . Whenever someone joins Que I see their name. How do I make it so their name is hidden but it shows someone is in the Que?
./anonymousqueue
is it possible to have different leaderboards for different roles? for example lets say i wanted to have an S rank and and A rank, is it possible to have seperate leaderboards for  both?
if all your stats are shared, you could make two different queues with `/rolerequirement`s
the leaderboard will only show players with the role requirement

Hello there! Thank you for your amazing bot ! ‚ù§Ô∏è
We're using it to play overwatch and I didn't find how people can select several roles (tank/DPS/support) ? They click to enter the queue and then they have to select one but can't say that they are available for several roles?

Also, is it possible to have MMR by queue role?
Thanks again and sorry if question has already been asked
there is currently no way to select multiple roles or get stats per role
Alright, thanks for very quick response!
Is the functionality planned? :/
I would pay for this üòÖ

~~Is it possible to not require people to join voice channels for the queue to continue~~ (i have figured this out now)
is the lobby channel a voice channel or text channel or both
voice channel
you can manually modify the `/tempchannels permissions`
How do I setup the text queue channel
`/tempchannels toggle`
fix the queue looking full when its not
also fix the vote menu not dissapearing
when the match is already finished
huh?
also voicechannels not deleting after match is finished
sometimes says that a team has a player in queue
when there is no player in that queue
and people get confused
when does it say that
Thanks
How do I give my moderators access to be able to cancel games?

i need help, please
how do i split roles in queue. i want to do gk 0/1 def 0/2 cm 0/2 forward 0/2 like here
`/roles`
`/ping`
You can give them a staff role `/staffrole add` which gets perms to use all commands
how do i add few roles in 1 queue and select how much ppl can join to 1 role
you can just specify the role multiple times
`/roles Field,Field,Field,GK` would be 3 field, 1 GK per team

"/clearqueue" removes everyone
"/player remove" removes a specific person

is there a way to log who votes who because people troll

No not really

<@145305657237700608>
The problem is the bot created probably 50 channels all day not 1500
did it go away?
or is it still happening
I won't know until folks start playing again around 20 CET
My server is experiencing the same issues
It hit the rate limit yesterday
I tried creating a channel myself and it‚Äôs fine, just an issue with the bot
rate limits are per user, not per server
I see, I believe the total that‚Äôs being created daily on my server is around 70-100
Today there‚Äôs still no new channels able to be created
The issue started around 9h ago
try `/tempchannels type type:Threads`
It seems like that‚Äôs working now
Any idea why threads can be created but not text channels?
the channel limit doesn't apply to threads for some reason
since threads aren't normal channels
i voted but it doesnt want me to show the leaderboard what can i do can smn help?
I see did discord change their maximum limit or something? I don‚Äôt really know why my server would hit the limits since it‚Äôs not hitting 1000
What does it say
that smn has to vote at least once
And I did
im not sure, ill investigate, but its not well documented
Appreciate the speedy reply and fix thank you
How do i let moderators see the privat queue channels so they can manage them easier?
Please still respond if its not possible.
you should give them a /staffrole
this is enough to see the channels?
since they have the default access of "User Commands", they won't get special perms to see the channels
you would have to give them full access, or use `/tempchannels permissions`
thx it worked fine
What is command to setup the vote thing in the queue so once they 1v1 they each can submit a vote who won
thats just how it works by default
unless you changed the `/message winnermessage results value:`
<@145305657237700608> 

I have the queue set up for 1v1, once you both join it takes you to a private text channel then you have to click the ready up button and then your both good to go but a vote message never pops up for us to vote who Won. What am I missing here
whats ur `/config save`
Havnt set that what name I need to put
U can name whatever u want it, or just press enter and it will generate a random name
But that doesn‚Äôt add a way for us to vote who won the 1v1 so it can update it to the leaderboard
i want the config so i can see what  you are missing lmao
This?
just use the command
`/config save`
That‚Äôs all it does idk what you wanting
literally just that
it has the configuration code, which i can see your config with
its a single team of 2, so theres no winners or losers
do `/teamsize 1`
`/numberofteams 2`
What I need is when we both ready up it opens another queue with this
Have the same problem
whats the problem?
What command do I type to make that response happen when we both ready up
bro i already told you the commands, did you run them?
works fine for me now
will only change new matches
Got it working now just need one more thing
<@145305657237700608>
Removing the team selection as a option
`/teamselection`
and just pick balanced
i should just update it to default to balanced if its a 1v1
Perfect fixed
Also how to edit this box to add a custom message
`/lobbydetails`
so to have different queues going at the same time, can you just have the same queue be in multiple channels?
if you have `/tempchannels toggle` Enabled, you can have multiple matches start from the same queue
so this is how i want it, we want to have queues seperate from each other but use the same config queue. we are seperating the queues based on their role so for example tier 1 players could only see the tier 1 queues and then tier 2 and tier 3 have a seperate queue that is only for them and we dont want the tier 2/3 players see the tier 1 queues if that makes sense
gotcha, then sure you can just have multiple queue channels
ok bet
Can I give a role to those who've made/are in parties?
I'd like to make my team creation system as automated as possible. The last bit I've been stuck on is getting teams sorted; an easy way for new members to create and add teammates to their party. 
What I had in my head, was a channel to show them how to '/party create', and whoever they invite (plus the creator), receives a "team" role, which will remove the creation channel from their view, and open up a scrim channel for teams to queue into.
Any chance something close is possible, or is this just out of reach for the bot
currently not possible, theres no autoroles which checks parties
how to do automatic voice channels?
Please someone can help

how to config register in Bot ?
my command /register not work
help me pls
says its loading the image
U CAN HELP ME ?
<@145305657237700608>
whats wrong
idk config register in my server
the command Register show this: ¬°No se encontr√≥ la cola! 
 Si desea una cola en este canal, ejecute /startqueue o /setup! 
 Si desea controlar una cola espec√≠fica desde este canal, use /link!
What I need to do ? Do I need to link registration in my game? Configure something I haven't done yet?
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
This didn't help me at all, the explanations are very superficial...

They say, enter the /register command, I enter it and it gives this message
nobody said to use the /register command
For example, before playing, I want whoever enters the server to register understands
thats only if you want to set your MMR using your game's account, like your valorant rank, rocketleague rank, etc
So in this case, I don't think I need this... however, I would like the user to register on the server so that I can use his nickname and add the points he earns, but for that I have to link the registration with my game?
<@145305657237700608> help me
maybe dont ping him lol
i would like to know how this challone stuff is working cause i didnt rlly undersand it, what can i do with it?
you dont need to register anything
people get their starting MMR when they queue
you link your account, then all  the tournament setup is done on challonge, and NeatQueue hosts the individual games
it will update on chanllonge if someone wins a game with neatqueue while tournaments? if they linked ofc
its all automated
How do I link the maps added to the list?
well this a bit confusing, i think its cause there is only 1 player
how would i fix the fact that everyone can see the options after a queue is full
yea 1 player tournament probably wont work
yup, i see it broke lol
says error
`/map add`
wdym
if you join the tournament, the button on the embed, will it put you in the challonge tournament too?
once enough people queue up, it asks to press the setting buttons, but everyone in the server can see it
maybe after it started?
is there a command to make a seperate channel everytime someone succesfully queues
you can only join a tournament in the registration phase
and only have them see it? Im trying to setup a 1v1 ladder where multiple games can go on at once
it will auto start when filled
will it show a bracket?
at start or before?
oh alr
I'm confused... Is the score added for users who win matches?
how do i let people join 2 queues at the same time
`/requeue condition`
the players vote for the winner
What commands should I use to create the list that only starts when the 6 players are logged in, and that shows the maps they want to play or not after the list is ready, then, is there a command for me to configure the voting? Or is everything automatic?
everything is automatic
if i have 2 queues going in one channel how do i get rid of the oldest queue when people are in it rn
but its not going to be used
if i delete it does it bug out for the people that are already in queue?
<@145305657237700608>
Is not possible you are running 2 queues in the same channel
like this
can i delete the one above
i did the config thing while people were in the other queue already
What happens if u hit join in the above one?
it just put me in the queue in the new one so i just deleted the old one
we good now
The maps are not appearing when people enter the lobby to vote on which ones they want, what could it be?
<@145305657237700608>
The match didnt even start, how is it supossed to show map voting?
How do I get the game to start?
All players need to be on queue voice channel by default
When do the maps appear to be chosen? and I noticed that after a few minutes the lobby was being closed without the game even ending...
maps are chosen after teams are picked
for some reason, the teams are assembled but they already jumped straight to choosing who won without showing the maps
how many maps did you add
the map option does not appear
use `/info` and check page 4
verify the maps are there
not have
i need add again ?
yes you must add them
Can I add them to any channel and it will be valid for all matches or do I have to do it manually every time?
once you add them to the queue they are there forever
How did I just leave the option to choose random teams?
is that so ? Is this where I decide who won?
`/teamselection`
How do I stop them from playing on a list without having enough points?
How do I make players' points appear alongside their nickname on the server?
u can help ?
Heyyoh I added the bot to a new Discord and its not showing up in the command list as a bot help me pwease
i want this <@145305657237700608>
Stop pinging him
`/ratinginname format ` & `/ratinginname toggle`
`/mmr requirement`
what's this parameters ? how to use ?
format and location
Parameters have descriptions
And suffix & preffix, is if you want the mmr to be displayed before the username or after the username
How do I allow only captains to choose maps?
with /map voting
Unable to create channels due to discord speed limit. Please try it again later!
what happened ?
This is happening when the lobby is going to be created
try using /tempchannels type Threads
i might have to update the channel creation to reuse channels more often
nice
now the lists fill up, they create the match topic but it's empty, without menus or anything, just with people in the room
guess it can‚Äôt create the voice channels either
due to the rate limit
like this?
what is this limit ?
discord blocks bots from making too many channels
How do we correct or fix this?
Is there any command or something I can do? Because I have an audience that plays daily, a lot of people, several rooms created daily, you know!

If this is the case, then this bot has been blocked and we cannot create matches?
seems like it
you can disable voice channels and just create them yourself
until it‚Äôs unblocked
with /lobbychannel toggle
And how does this happen? Will I lose mine? The dots ? the options will no longer appear?
Or whenever a match is created, will I have to set the command saying what the lobby channel will be?
it will just skip that step in the setup
you can use /readyup mode Buttons instead
Okay, but what about the buttons? they don't appear, even though I tell them to enter the manually created voice channel
i use:
did u disable lobbychannels
They are disabled, now what?
try again
nice
Hi, we are using the tempchannel, but the message that should go to the channel created for the winner voting is going to the queue channel, and players cannot use the buttons for voting how can I fix this?
hey my queue just disapeared
in the channel and people cant join now the image is gone, to pick team
how do i get it back
type in channel
Someone prob deleted the msg
or use /clearqueue
wdym?
Here there is a limit of 50 matches per day, when are they released again?
here is our queue channel with no typing permission everytime someone win, winner messages comes up to queue channel like this how to i remove
i fixed voting issue but couldn't this one
i tried winnermessage pin disabled and sticky disabled as well
this one is just fine
in tempchannel
noon eastern time, when bot posts in <#935731235790139422>
change the /resultschannel
to change where the results pop up
there is a result channel already
this one only for staffs
Thats a staff channel
You probably disabled the winner voting to just staffs
i want to make them vote in their temporary queue channels with 4 vote
`/message winnermessage results`
Change it back to default
i fixed it now they can vote for their own game
issue is
i don't want to let it shows on queue channel
Where do I add premium to the bot? Does it pay off? What are the advantages? how is the payment done ?
<@857633321064595466> premium
> ### How to get premium
> 1) Login at https://www.neatqueue.com
> 2) Click the Dashboard tab
> 3) Select your server
> 4) Purchase credits and/or select a plan
would you like to come our server and take a look briefly ?
What do you mean?
that‚Äôs /resultschannel
change it to something else
not the queue channel
i will try it thank you for your help guys
Anyway to make it where it doesn't automatically take them out of the queue when they leave the VC?
disable VC as a /queueentry method
it‚Äôs not a default setting
I couldn't manage it somehow, could you come to the server and help for 2 minutes?
I know but i want to let them stay in and queue in both ways
ah so you are saying join via VC, but not leave?
it‚Äôs just that one command
How do I display the maps like this before the queue starts?
Look how mine is
I wanted to be beautiful like this
that‚Äôs a different bot
aahhh
you can try setting details in the /message queuemessage footer
Do these messages appear before the queue starts?
it‚Äôs the queue message itself
Some people are trying to play but receive the message that they are already in a game when they are not
Yes, be able to join the VC, which would put you into the queue but when they leave the VC they don‚Äôt get thrown out of the queue. Some people go to talk to other people in a call or to another discord for a second things like that while they‚Äôre waiting.
Maybe make it a toggle function
Because it inherently forces people to stay in the VC, unless they know that they can press the button again which we can tell them but if an admin or somebody that knows, isn‚Äôt there then that can be a problem
I don‚Äôt wanna make it auto throw them out, essentially
what happened ?
How do I make the player able to join the queue when he receives the message that he is already in a match when he is not?
Everyone who is logging in to play, when trying to play again receives this:
not sure what that says
yea that would be a good idea to have an option for only join
The bot doesn't let anyone who has already played play again! He says the person is leaving
i‚Äôm not sure what config you have set up
and without the english translation, i‚Äôm not sure what the error is
it‚Äôs an expected error, so something with your config
How do I remove players from a match and/or end everyone's matches by command?
you can‚Äôt, you need the match winner to be selected
I set the premium, after that, everyone who played the last game and new players who only play 1 game receive a warning that they are in a game, what is it?
if they are in a game, they can‚Äôt enter another game, until the first game finishes
Yes, however, all the games are over, the points have been received, but they are prevented from entering, you know?
Hi, sorry to butt in but I also moderate that discord, just to put you in context, what happens is that everyone has already finished their game, but for some reason when they want to enter the list, the bot prevents them from the common error is "You cannot join a new queue while you are in a game".
I have already tried to clean the queue but the same error still appears
For captains who do not make picks within the given time, can we create a command like autoban instead of autopick, considering it as if they dodged because they were AFK? This is because autopick sometimes creates unbalanced teams, and it would be more appropriate for the AFK player to receive a direct ban but I don't know if there is another possible or applicable situation
can u swap to english and give me the exact error
Okay
not currently
but i think everytime if captain autopicks picks highest point player right ?
<@145305657237700608>
so it thinks a match is still being setup, does it make matches in new channels?
The error is the same if you enter other channels.
yes, but every new match is in a new channel, right?
do those channels still exist?
No, because when we award points the channels are automatically deleted.
I fixed it, I just cancelled the last games, I think it bugged the bot, thanks for your help.
How do I remove the rematch button?
/mvp toggle /rematches
I use this sequence of buttons to create a queue, but for some reason people, after playing a single game, can no longer play, and receive the warning that they are in a game and cannot join... Even though I delete the channel and recreate it the queues are no use...
I removed the bot from the server, deleted everything, channels, matches, etc., put the bot back in, and the error of not being able to join the match persists!

This is probably a bug that makes it impossible for everyone to play, not to mention that we have its premium and we went through it
You are not supossed to end queue after every game
I want to reshuffle the maps, but is there a way to limit this? Like random maps comes out and if they dont want to play they can shuffle for once. Players are abusing it when its unlimited shuffle clicking until they get the map they want
how do i make it so the team vc is restricted to team members
No theres no option to rimit reshuffles
Thats by default, unless you added a staff role, or spectator role or changed category perms, or changed channel restrictions
i have changed the category perms
so do i just undo all the category perms?
It will depend on what you changed
Mostly connect to vc perms
of the things you mentioned
i only changed the category perms
and some perms for the individual channels
like the queue channel, results channel etc
It will just affect tempchannel the category perms one
So check out them
Does anyone know the solution to the problem I mentioned?

that of players not being able to enter the match because it is said that they are already in one even though they are not?
Have they voted the match yet?
Even when the match is done, basically tempchannels and results done?
yes, it was voted, channels closed and points delivered
Hmm, i dont really can think of any case for that to happen
Can you guys pls sponsor my league?
You have <#1116094649048760442> if thats what you mean
Wow, we even paid to have a better experience with the Bot but it seems that now we are having the worst experience possible
Sorry but i dont really see whats wrong, the bot has a guide, if u followed it you shouldnt have any problems, the commands you sent are normal, so i dont know what exactly youre doing internally
So, how can I remove the bot, stop all channels and queues, and create the queue using just the /startqueu command and trying to enter the message that I am already in a match appears?

I already tested using a single command to start the queue, in order to see if it was a wrong command that I entered, but the error continues...
Can you invite to the server to see what it could be
if you guys don‚Äôt figure it out, share the config code and i‚Äôll give it a shot
come in my server
help me :v
Lmk when you change the code I'll pay to expedite lol
Had people asking üò≠bc we tried the current version
help bro neatz :v
have you tried deleting the queue channel
and trying a new one
ye we did
ok invite me
come
again
the error
rip bot
what happened
Same error as before...

look at the channel
hey guys for some reason the bot is not auto dragging ppl to the vc is something wrong with it? is there a command too fix it?
<@145305657237700608> could u help rq i need it rn
rip bot
is urs messing up as well whats wrong with urs?
In mine, anyone who played 1 game can't play any more...

The bot keeps saying that the person is in the game when they are not
oh lol
I don't know what to do, everyone is disappointed here
someone help ?
no way no one is helping
i can‚Äôt help out rn
rly ? wtf
yes sorry i have a life to attend to sometimes, my bad
If not even you who made the Bot can and/or want to help, then we are all lost :v[
<@145305657237700608>
do you not have any clue of what caused it?
you have /lobbychannel pullall enabled?
what‚Äôs ur config
do /config save
it fixed
also how do I let other people join the locked teams channel
like staff for example
<@145305657237700608>
`/tempchannels permissions set `
What did u do?
could i make a auto role for the person with the most mmr? if not this should be a <#911057745204105237>
`/autoroles topplayers set`
If a player leaves the server and rejoins later, will the leaderboard remember their stats?
Awesome, that is great!
well nvm
i smh fked up my temp channel permissions, is there a way to reset them?
like set default for all roles
hello?
<@648635725964902411> can you help me a sec i got a problem rn, my temp channels arent privat anymore
What commands did u use?
Added a staff role or spectator role?
the ``/temp channel permission`` stuff
i did something wrong, when i realised it, i did set default permissions for the everyone role (view channel perm). That maybe made it worse.
If i deny the permission, the people in queue have no acces to their own privat channel.
Just reverse the command u did
i messed up a few hours ago, i dont remember whats wrong
could you tell me what default does?
Do /logs, itll show the commands u used
k 1 sec
what means,  value: 0
or value 1 & 2
i need to know which numbers means  ``deny`` , ``allow`` , ``default``
Its on the values when u do `tempchannel perms`
which is 0? the lowest?
option
Deny = 0, allow = 1, default = 2
the first thing i did was denying some stuff so no one can see the temp channels, then i allowed it so everyone could see the temp channels, the default command neither does fix it
would can i do?
Uh, that should work on next queue
sure? what do i do with my auto role?
everyone has it, just default too?
so if i set everything to default it will make privat channels again?
If u do that command again but change it to default it should fix it
let me try
im waiting now for the queue to open
it didnt work
still random people and roles in there
did you saw my message Don?
<@648635725964902411> bro
Ok dont ping, please.
I tested by myself and it works just how i told you, so you must be doing it in some different queue or i don't know.
sorry, i gotta go in about 20 mins, and i got 5 dms alredy about that error
wdym a different queue?
i only have 1
Then i dont really know, i used `/tempchannels permissions set role:@everyone permission:View Channel value:Default` and it worked for me
couldnt it be something else? like there is no privat symbol on channels
anything?
the things that effect perms for the temp channels are:
`/channel restrictions`
`/staffrole`
`/tempchannels permissions`
ill try
youll have to check the channel perms and see what is granting access
If u used some diff commands before then that could be, but from what you told me is how i said it
wait could it be something with the categorie permission!?
and could i fix something with /channel restrictions ?
does it make the temp channels privat?
Guys
my only staff role is @moderator,  and i dont know what ``/channel restrictions`` rlly does
i think its cause of the command, maybe another permission, not the view channel permission?
could i invite one of you guys to the server or thats not allowed? maybe that could help somh
im rlly confused by this bot .-.
shouldn the bot normally create automatically privat channels? and not block any roles?
this could be something else not? im not sure
By default, yes.
I changed the options and then joined the queue, but it doesn't show my nick. I tested several times and other people were testing, the nicks don't appear anywhere, except in one place (second screen). How to fix this?
Nicks are supossed to just appear there, or in captain selection
its default, ill just search in my logs any commands then. Maybe i found something, hopefully.
Second problem I have is that when both players have 1000 MMR and it says like on the screen above (+50) next to their nicks before the game starts. But after the game the winning player gets +66 and the losing player -66. I disabled all multipliers.
`/channel restrictions` restricts channel viewing, so only the people in that queue can see, maybe u changed that? Category perms aswell can override, just check everyone role
``/channel restrictions`` should be enabled right?
make sure you start a new match after changing any settings
my categorie permissions only disable typing and adding reactions for @everyone, it shouldnt be that
Ok looks like it was the placement multiplier, now it works, thank you for the help.
ITS FIXED TYSM SUPPORT RAARARAHAHAHA
another question (ik im annoying), how can i change all the temp channel names to for examply: queue-200 -> match-200
`/tempchannels name name_format:match-$`
Is there a plan to add head to head to /compare?
To show the all time score between two specific players
`/compare`
When I use compare, I'd like to show how many times those two players had faced each other and what their all time head to head score is
so "/compare Nathan Don Soap" would show we've played 7 times and I've won 3, Do has won 4
voted but cant do /stats or /leaderboard
also way to create role requirement  to queue?
`/rolerequirement add`
I voted on the top.gg website and it still says I have to vote
very strange
<#919709100114346076> !
In a queue with roles, let's say I have 2 slots for some role. But I see that I can go over the limit (at least in the Test mode) and add myself as that role more than 2 times. So I can add 3 times and it is now displayed like this: Role Name 2/2 +1
What is the purpose of these additional players over the limit in a queue that can only start when a certain amount of players add to it? Can I disable this to avoid people being added to the wrong role by accident over the limit, only to find that they will not play? Or maybe it only works in the /test mode?
its not a test mode thing, but if someone only wants to play a specific role, then it ensures they are next up in queue for that role automatically
In case someone will leave the queue?
hey, currently 3 of my queues are linked, and the global leaderboard is actively updating. However, I would like to create a queue that doesn't impact statistics such as MMR, losses, and wins‚Äîperhaps a fun queue. How can I set up a queue like that?
yes, or for the next match
they will goto the front of the queue automatically
do you have serverwide stats enabled?
there is a 3 of queue which is working for 3 different ranks and for same game
those are all 3v3 queue and i want to make 1v1 queue which doesn't effect others
Is there a way to disable this?
no there is not
its a bit complicated, plz open a forum post and ill help you there
its the "connect" permission
Wdym?
Do you want anyone to join?
specific people to join the locked
team 1 and team 2 vcs
u said yes to a 'anyone' question, then u say only specific people can connect, then whats the question?
the command i said, has connect permission
SORRY BROTHER
A specific role to join the locked ones
The command i said then just specify a role
when I use the command for people with "MOD" role the VCs are still locked
you want /voicechannels permissions
confusing, tempchannels is the text channel
Okay
Hold up I think we got it
What should i put for the m to see the channel
like "Queue-93" for example
the text channel
should be view channel
or just view, it‚Äôll pop up though
<@145305657237700608> am I tripping or there was something I could do to prevent someone to queue in multiple queues at the same time and now I can't anymore? Or maybe I didn't see the command but pretty sure there isn't a way anymore to prevent that..
you cant
but when one queue starts a match, they will automatically be removed from other queues
How can i do space here to rewrite a message with the right form ?
ineed it like this 
`Lobby pass
No sho ?
Developed by`
<@145305657237700608>
Oh okay, that's fair.

But in the past, there was a command to prevent people from queuing into two different queue, am I right?
Using "\n", pretty sure its on the docs
Basically
 ```
Hey\n Hey2
# This Would be
Hey
Hey2
```
yea you are not tripping
it was removed a long time ago though
Yeah I didn't mess with the bot for a while lmao, thanks for easing my mind üòÖ
i would like to receive notifications in the #bans channel when players are banned, so that the banned individual and other players can see who is banned for what duration and which reason. However, I couldn't customize this, so I created a command, but I couldn't give permission to members (non-staff) for it. Is there a way to do this?
When a player moves up from the bronze queue to the silver queue, for example, I was able to allow him to play on a lower queue, however, I was unable to make victories in an inner queue add points to him
Is there a command for this?
Anyone have a Free for all Queue for 8 people?

Always thank you in advance by the way
you can set the /numberofteams to 8, and /teamsize 1
not currently
100% just wondering if somebody had one that‚Äôs premade but Thank you.
Ok is there anyway I can help? Also, if you‚Äôre looking for more programmers, I know a guy or two.
help
you will have to create a /staffrole which has the default user permissions
then add the banlist command via /staffrole command allow
thank you and how to turn off dm notifications when we reach another rank etc
./autoroles notify
Is there a command to mute all players when captains are picking
Because when some1 pings a captain and the captain replies to his message that player gets picked
how can i fix this?

that‚Äôs a good point
no there isn‚Äôt a way to stop that
but it shouldn‚Äôt work like that, i‚Äôll think about changing it
okey ty
Ight
I found that command /captains automute tho
But it didn't work
What's the command to force highest MMR players to be captain?
it mutes in voice, not sending messages
that‚Äôs the command
Thanks, I'm dumb. I thought it was going to populate but it's actually a drop down after you type that command
How do I link the points of one channel to be shown in the statics of another?

I just wanted a single channel showing the statistics for all queues
if the stats are separate, you can't combine them into 1 display
Can IGN be set using API post request?
not currently, but can be added
i would appreciate that very much
I‚Äôm trying to build a bot that does something similar to /register for my use case
hey i voted and it still says i dont have access to using stats feature
I have many configs in my list how to remove it ?
I need to remove all configs from my bot
<@145305657237700608>
Sorry for mention ‚òπÔ∏è but i need any solve bec my program being stolen i made it from a to z
configs are not deletable
<#919709100114346076>
so what can i do to remove my configs from another bot in another server ?
it's my config and anyone can get it so i need to delete it
configs arent public, how are they getting it then?
I have been loaded my config to another server and the owner of this server took my config and start sharing it
So i need to delete this config from his server
What can i do
you cant
the server is using the config, you don't "own" it
Iknow but i need to end the queue so he cannot start this config again
U know what am talking about
if you are not staff in the server, there is nothing i can help with
Iam staff already
I have administrator on the server so what u can help me with ?
you can use any commands you want if you are staff
Yes but i need to delete the latest config from the list
you cant delete them
technically it only shows the 15 most recent ones
So i can add 15 config to hide the latest right
technically, yes
Thanks man üôå
I had a few queues on various channels for test, after deleting the channels (without using /endqueue before the deletion), I still see the queues at the bottom of the: /serverstats info
Even after resetting all stats, the queues are there.
Can I remove them somehow from there? Maybe I should recreate the queues with the same names and then /enqueue them or reset the stats? Is there any other better solution?
I have ~~betting~~ predictions set up, and I thought it was going well until I noticed an issue today.

Even if someone doesn't bet on a match, their points go up whether they win or lose their match. I just did a test-run. Nobody bet on the match, and I checked the stats of two players on separate teams pre and post match. Both players went up in points, even though one lost and one won.

Is this intentional? I thought a player was only supposed to have their points affected if they won or lost.

Also, only the player on the left has the role allowed to bet. The one on the right does not, and never has, according to him.
by default, every players gets 100 points for each match they play
`/points change`
If I set this to 0, they will only gain/lose if they place a bet. Am I understanding correctly?
yup!
but they will have no way to gain points
"initial points"
Great. Thanks!

I have everyone set to start with 100. Maybe I'll raise it.
could you screenshot it and show?
Another question. If the temporary channel is created as thread and the parent queue channel doesn't give rights to players to use bot commands, will they be able to use commands on the temporary threads that is attached to this parent queue channel?
Does /substitute need to be used on the temporary channel or can it be used to any other channel? If on any channel, does the channel need to be linked to the queue channel by the /link command?
since there are matches played, it will stay there
Ok thank you for the answer.
I would appreciate if you could also answer my other two questions. Thank you.
threads inherit the same perms as the channel iirc
must be used in the match channel
Thank you for the answers. That's a problem. I would like people to not use commands on the queue channel, yet I would like the temporary channels to be threads. I guess there is nothing that can be done in this case.
it needs to be in the match channel, otherwise it won't know which match you are  trying to substitute in
I understand
Isn‚Äôt it that a player can only play one match at the same time on the server? I think it is, and if yes, then the bot should be able to figure this out maybe. Bot probably knows who used a command and he also maybe would be able to find the match by the username.
by default,  yes
but not in all configs
What would I need to set to allow a player be in two matches at the same time?
`/requeue condition`
by default,  you can be in 2 matches if you vote for the winner
or 3 matches, no limit
Hmm, I thought that voting for winner is equal to the fact that the game ended, unless someone would want to cheat and vote before the end.
after enough votes, the match will end
I know but it may be assumed that since this person voted, he claims that the match ended, so he would not want to do a substitution for a match that he already voted for.
in this specific case, sure
So currently it is possible to vote for the winner and then use the substitute command for this match? That sounds like something that should not be allowed.
i can see it being useful in certain scenarios
I see
Maybe I could use some additional bot that would read messages and if someone would write .substitute @name on the match thread that other bot would handle the substitution.
bots cant use commands
why not just let them use commands?
I would like the queue channel to be clean, just with the queue (even though I know that is sticks to the bottom), I created separated channel for commands.
I will just use a normal match channel then or enable the commands.
Hey just wanted to ask if there was a way to force matchmaking queue to start only when force started, I have tried to use /match start when forcestarted yet it always pops a match regardless of this condition when 10 people have joined the queue
I have a queue with roles and I would like players to stick to the roles they pick, so how to prevent people from using the /role command to set their role on the match channel after the game is about to start?
yeah for some reason whenever we have captains mode with players picking captains we only have 6/8
hey, when I want to use the /leaderboard command it tells me to vote on the top.gg site but even after voting it still does not work, what should I do? From what I can tell there is also no way for me to get access to the leaderboards from the website.
<#919709100114346076>
ok, thank you
hmm i guess matchmaking doesn't work with force start
setting a /role won't impact anything if you are in queue
itll update for the next time you queue
<@145305657237700608> Yo, is it possible to setup so the random captains pick are set to like, so they have a minimum of 15 20 games or whatever?
is there a way to disable the dm from when you join queue through a vc or is that not yet implemented as a toggle
which DM is that?
not currently
i looked around in the documentation but couldnt find anything
its only when you join via the vc, clicking the queue button sends no dm
no way to toggle that
its the only way to provide feedback to the user
yeah that makes sense
thank you
if the user doesn't want the feedback, would it be sensible to allow them to tell the bot not to dm them as a preferential option?
More of a trivial question really, users can mute client-side and not have to deal with the ping
hmm yea there is /autoroles notify, but a user command which disables DMs entirely could be a good idea
its problematic for certain features which rely on DMs though
like for joining queue via VC, if you need to select a role, that happens in DMs
seems like there could be different categories for dm related features
which can be opted out of by a user
i.e. dms that notify, dms involved in matchmaking process (can't be opted out of), etc etc
I just don't know how big or proportionate these categories would be
ah thats unfortunate, thanks anyway
i voted alredy
do it in your server
I use monthly leaderboards and I was doing testing in February, then I reset the stats but the Feb 2024 tab is still in the leaderboard (both on discord and also on the web version). It will be always empty, so is there a method to delete it?
i can change it, whats the channel ID?
Thank you, the queue channel ID: 1211029260488282143
I would like to have an anonymous queue with 4 slots. When full the bot would automatically create 2 1v1 games with players picked by MMR? Is this possible to achieve this and how?
done
yes, set the /numberoflobbies to 2
What should the queuetype be?
PUGs
Ok thank you
if you want to start immediately at 4 players
One last question. Will I get any notification anywhere about my premium coming to an end to remember to renew it?
...no, but would be good to add
same with auto-renew with available credits
Why are some usernames numbers? Any way to change this?
discord bug
Maybe an option to show ign there would work
Maybe I have false memories, but I remember that I have somewhere seen most active rankings that are using this bot, is this possible to see such ranking?
<#935731235790139422> is the only place that data is public, if you meant that
That's it, I was unable to spot it on the channel list
<@145305657237700608> I made a queue channels where players can not use commands and because of this they can not also use commands on match channels, how to let them use commands on match channels?
`/tempchannels permissions`
Thank you
It works thx. But out of curiosity: if on the queue channel in the discord settings I would set send messages permission to disallowed but application commands to allowed, would the new channels automatically copy the application command permission setting from the queue channel to the match channel?
Will players be flagged by avoiding voting for winners many times? Looks like no, but that could be useful. At least in 1v1 this could work, I see that it may be problematic in normal voting because not everyone needs to vote, but in 1v1 where it is the most needed it could be useful.
If players will use /ping on the match channel, will it work?
If 1 players voted only in the voting for winner and the matchcleanup time hit, is it a TIE or the team he voted for wins?
Is there a way to set a cooldown to the autoping feature? I'm quite certain my playerbase would find it very funny to spam leave and rejoin the queue at the threshold to spam ping and I can't find anything about a cooldown.

Bot not dragging anyone
Bot stopped giving roles when players get to a certain mmr (ranks)
Also adding that the leaderboard is not working
Just keeps loading. We voted, reset it, tried the command again. Nothing is helping. I also tried <#919709100114346076>
seconded
oops i forgot to turn ping off mb
nope, glad to know someone else is experiencing the same issues
Is any1 elses bot not dragging people around anymore?
same problem, leaderboard doesn't work
Is there a way for the stats from a previous month to be saved, as like a Season 1 type thing, or once reset the stats disapper from the previous leaderboard?
its sending my queue into a different channel completley
ive checkd info already
<@145305657237700608>
wdym
im queueing in open queue and it moves to ladys lobby lol
is bot restarting? how low will it take?
Usually 20
I wish it wouldn't restart at 8pm est on a Friday
20 minutes?
so 20 from now?
<@648635725964902411>
Do you know how long this will last
just maybe an ETA
How long is this gonna be down for?
Cuz it‚Äôs happening in my server too
neatqueu is about to restar
other bug ?
fixed for me
the queue gives the win after time to the person with the most votes, how do i disable this?
`/timer matchcleanup`
I asked several questions like 30 messages above, would appreciate an answer, thank you.
Isn‚Äôt pulling  people into lobbies
Leaderboard is still broken
seems fine for me
Ok it works now
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> tournament team size makes the number of teams not number of participants
i‚Äôm pretty sure it works fine?
<@145305657237700608> Any ideas why is my leaderboard not working? https://www.neatqueue.com/lb/5v5
i dont see that URL anywhere
It redirects to it after clicking the title,  I now generated new /leaderboard to make sure and clicked the title, this is the url, I have not changed it. But I have set url for my other queue and maybe this somehow broke the first one. I may try to set new url, but this looks like a bug.
I created new url to fix
Question: If only 1 players voted in the voting for winner and the matchcleanup time runs out, is it a TIE or the team he voted for wins?
whoever has more votes gets the win
only a tie if the votes are tied
<@145305657237700608> Is there any way to see the daily amount of ranking games and players of my server?

How do you count the "Up to 1000 players" in the Basic Plan? Is this total (from the start of the rankings) or per month?
you can check `/serverstats info` which has some data
the player count is total players who have queued
i am planning on reworking the premium pricing model so the player limits are monthly though, total players is a bit unfair imo
<@145305657237700608> /leaderboard not working despite voting for the bot
not sure how to resolve it
<#919709100114346076>
thank you
hi. Is it possible to have more than the maximum # of player for the lobby join the queue? For example, I host brawlhalla custom games, the max number of players for 1 game is 8. Usually more than 8 people want want to play in the custom games. How can I get a "waiting queue" that shows the order of the queue list?
usually the queue immediately empties when a match starts, if you have temp text channels enabled
cool that works TY üòÑ
maybe someone in here can help me. i have the bot set up to my liking just looking to place the results where i want them to go. It is supposed to go to a private staff channel so noone can see it but im not positive if im doing it correctly.
i used /resultschannel and also /staffchannel neither of those commands are it i believe... its the screen for the staff to decide who won or wether it was a tie. if someone has the command line lmk im just confused im sure
`/staffchannel` would be that staff only results you want
make sure the bot has perms to send messages  there
ok bet
thanks
i set it up how you said and it still delievers this to the wrong channel
use `/staffchannel remove`, then add it back
maybe you did
`/staffchannel set channel:... serverwide:False`
appreciate the help ill try that now
Im so surprised challonge and neat queue can not run 4v4 brackets on their site haha
4 teams?
it can definitely do a 4v4 tournament (2 teams of 4)
I tried challonge and it does not
<@145305657237700608> try it please and if you do get it record it
what didnt work? ive tried a bunch of tournaments
It was so hard this past weekend because it had worked somewhat before and it was hell this past weekend. It required everyone to make a party and all the specifics were a lot to get across I made teams of 4 but they had to be invited to the team, why can't individuals just join it by clicking the button. Also challonge has no explanation in making teams of 4
I had two people look at it including myself and it was crazy
yes you need to create a party to join the tournament
if its 4v4, then you need a group of 4 players to be your team
this is not relevant to challonge at all, challonge just shows teams, not actual players
How exactly do you use the /register command? do you add in the [Account] field your Valorant username#hash or do you need to pair NeatQ with the aimlabs bot?
the documentation just says account: (Required) Account details.
so honestly no idea what that means
`/register` will fetch your in game rating using your account
different games require different inputs, so yea its confusing
valorant would be like you said, user#tag
Is it possible to put like 8 maps and the 2 captains keep banning them untill there is only 1 map to be played?
I've tried to do this with just my own user#tag and it keeps returning as error 'wrong formatting'
yes, `/map add` all the maps, then set `/map bans`
what are you trying? i can check
/register Sajai#iron1
since its my val tag
what region?
APAC
seems like its only doing na and eu
so thats why
oh thats unfortunate, it still works tho bc we have primarily eu and na players
would you be able to fix this tho?
yes, ill add apac tomorrow
this is where i pull valorant MMR from:
https://api.kyroskoh.xyz/valorant/v1/mmr/apac/Sajai/iron1?show=eloonly&display=0
doesn't seem to work for you?
nvm im dumb:
https://api.kyroskoh.xyz/valorant/v1/mmr/ap/Sajai/iron1?show=eloonly&display=0
sorry just saw this msg, lemme take a look
uhhh still getting error fetching mmr, also I'm not sure how val mmr works backend wise so I wouldn't know if that number displayed is the same as my current visable rank of Plat 1
that API seems to work fine, i would assume thats your internal rating
Matches cant start
hmm interesting, either way /register cant seem to pull it for some reason
i didn‚Äôt update yet
tomorrow
Now this
it can‚Äôt create the voice channel
so yea it‚Äôs just blocked on making channels entirely which is unfortunate
I assume I should just wait and let you do your thing?
i can‚Äôt really do anything
it seems to just kinda happen
ah ok gotcha, tyvm
<@145305657237700608> 
Using command `staffchannel set` doesn‚Äôt set the Staff Results Channel in `info`
make sure the bot has perms to send messages
uh i need help w this thing
i have no idea how it queues after 6 players have joined
i cant make it work on my own server
pls help
could you explain more
Is there any way I can buy a license so I don't need to have anyone upvoting every 12 hours, it's incredibly annoying.
you only have to vote once a month
but yes, premium does not require that
<@145305657237700608> why make a party when people could just go into a lobby and maybe just get a confirmation message? creatingm then joining a specific party by using commands seems more than needed. Also start.gg is 10x better
it‚Äôs meant to be team vs team, where you make your team and try to win the tournament
basically, i want the bot to start a queue after 6 players have entered the queuing system
It works inside their server apparently, why can't it work in mine?
you need the team size to be 6
based on your /roles, it‚Äôs 8 players per team
Same thing happening
how do i do that?
<@145305657237700608>
what do we do
do you have too much games going on?
theres none on rn
oh shet it went down
cool
you can try to set the type channels to threads to see how it goes
`/tempchannels type`
whats the command for that
oh bet
Maybe neatZ can give u a better solution of why that happens
how many games did u have today
curious
i mean maybe like 5-10 in the past 24 hrs
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> i tried the threads but the ready thing isnt popping up
uhh weird
Did that happen just out of nowhere or sum
yeah
this whole thing
bots broken for us
if you have a lobby voice channel it would get stuck on that
i‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs becoming more and more common
what‚Äôs your server ID
can someone translate this and try to help me
Hii All,
new to this, i want to setup cod 8's lobby for me and my friends. how is the best way to set it up, with random team matchmaking (max 8 players) and random maps choosing from the bot
i want to make a hardpoint only channel and a serie channel (hardpoint, search and destroy, controll) and want to make them all best out of 5
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
how do i set up the match to be best of 3
How can we remove this random button that is now starting to appear for bans, we dont want this for our map selection.
`/bestof `
is there any way to change the drafts from snake to regular? (1 pick at a time?)
when adding these details do you put all of em in one go? or you keep adding three a sentence>
Just specify, bestof 3 or 4 or a number
`/bestof number:4`
`/captains drafttype`
could i remove the ability to text chat in the que channel?
thanks
You can change the category perms where the channel will be created
i am trying to test my que but its not showing up
<@648635725964902411>
Your message lays too many options
Make sure the bot has perms to send messages in category and channels
<@648635725964902411> it has all the perms in discord. the actual que works but im trying to run a test.
Ah, so you meant the game doesnt start, use `/test`
I got it im trying to now have the captains be the ones who select the maps
`/map voting`
how can i set up a current leaderboard by MMR?
Also adding on how can I set up different ques based on role/skill level?
leaderboard sorts by MMR by default
give different queues a `/rolerequirement`, and use `/autoroles` to assign roles automatically
<@145305657237700608> can we set that only captains ban maps after it's enabled with /map ban
Does the API token generated through `/webhook generatetoken` have expiration date?
cool thanks
I probably accidentally overwrote it then
Wdym overwrote?
When u run the command u get an api key
And if u run it again it will just give another one, not overwrite the last one
nah itll overwrite and kill the old key
Oh it works like that
Didnt know
how do i remove the / roles?
<@145305657237700608>
Now my que only says two instead of 8
with just `/roles`
What are the channels called or what, no one can do things trough neatqueue
Did u let someone invite the bot
did you even check the audit logs to see who did it?
thats not my bot lmao
`NeatQueue#0850`
is the official bot
alright well thats not my fault lmao
dont be slandering my bot
<@857633321064595466> has a verified bot tag as well
idk if you are trolling or not
you're definitely trolling
So if someone scams u acting as a Steam for example, is Steam's inc fault?
Cool
u think i can just call up Discord and get a bot banned?
feel free
if you are inviting unverified bots from random places, thats on you
well that was a first
idk wether to believe that or not
Imagine getting outplayed like that üò≠
Roblox scams are still working for a reason
really said he was gonna use elo by andy, at least use inhousequeue smh
idk if i want someone like that using it
true
"my phone got stolen, why are you letting this happen to me?"
ok bro
<@145305657237700608> Bot is always trying to create teams to have MMR as equal as possible. This works great in theory and numbers, but may not be the [optimal/most fair/most fun for players] way to form teams. Let me write an example:

Team A (AVG MMR: 1333):
Player 1: 2000 MMR
Player 2: 1000 MMR (min possible)
Player 3: 1000 MMR (min possible)

Team B (AVG MMR: 1333):
Player 1: 1333 MMR
Player 2: 1333 MMR
Player 3: 1333 MMR

In many team games (especially hardcore games that are easy to play hard to master), the difference between 1000 and 1333 may be big. On top of that when 1000 is the minimum, the player can be really bad, but he can not go below this value.

Not only that, but in many team games, the team may be as good as its worse player, so one high MMR player will not be able to do too much when having 2 bad players next to him.
This is the case in my real time soccer game.

The solution that would probably work for me, would be to add an option so the bot would pick the players like this:
- First sort the players by MMR from highest to lowest. We will have a list of 6 players sorted by MMR.
- Now pick the players from the list like this:
Team 1: 1, 3, 5
Team 2: 2, 4, 6

Will still be pretty close in terms of MMR, but the MMR will be more evenly distributed between teams.

Would be great to have such option.
yea that makes sense, might be a bit difficult to add a command for something like that
like, how would you specify how this breaks down
I am not sure what you mean. This would work the same every time. Just a command to switch the type of team creation between the current one and the new one.
oh i guess i was thinking as a user, you would be able to set how the balancing works yourself
in case someone wants it to be 1,2,4,5 vs 3,6,7,8 etc
cuz gotta remember,  you can do any number of teams, any team size, etc
I see for me it would be enough to just add the most obvious matching 1 - 2, 3 - 4, 5 - 6 etc. (having the eventual roles in mind in role queue as I use it).
Just adding a new type to
/balanceby type

would work
ok yea makes sense
I got complains from players about exactly the situation I described (1 good player with 2 bad ones) and I realized that this will be only worse with time and will just make no sense and be a source of frustration.
yea you might need to switch to random selection or captains for now
I know, I will probably have to.

So any chance that you would add such thing? And if yes more or less when?
I also have another question that I already asked some days ago but I think without answer:

Will players be flagged by avoiding voting for winners many times? Looks like no, but that could be useful. At least in 1v1 this could work, I see that it may be problematic in normal voting because not everyone needs to vote, but in 1v1 where it is the most needed it could be useful.
throw it in <#911057745204105237> first and can think about it a bit more üòÑ
the anticheat flag is only for incorrectly voting, not for not voting at all
Is it possible to mix role queue and teams picked by captains? Will they need to pick players according to roles?
yes, it will only allow them to pick players who fit on the team
the lobby isnt being pulled
even when i put the pul all comman
new config, or its no longer working
<@145305657237700608> to me?
wdym>
Is there a way to remove the 60minute requeue or make it longer?
what are you talking about exactly
yea like new issue, or just issue with that config
When 10 stacking the bot will requeue or cancel queue every 60 minutes
oh `/timer queuereset`
defaults to 1 hour
empties queue if no interactions for 1 hour
Is there a way to remove that or make it longer?
yea just use that command
One more thing, I invited the bot to my disc, gave it all roles but I type /setup or /startqueue and nothing
must be missing perms to send messages
How do I reset the MMR of my Neat Queue?
I want to do monthly Seasons for my Customs
Does the ```/crosschat join``` functionality work? I am not sure I understand it. I ran the join command in my two servers and then started typing messages but nothing appeared in either chat
yes it works, just tried
Okay maybe my permissions are incorrect in my first server.
the bot needs perms to create webhooks in both channels
it would send an error if it failed though
did it say `Successfully joined the crosschat!`
I just verified all the permissions in both.
To verify, don't I simply send a message in one chat, then check that it was received in the other server?
Am I understanding that correctly?
yep thats right
did you make a specific room, or just join the default
I made a room with a unique name
can you DM it to me
Question! How can I get the queues to start whenever does a "!q" option instead of a button to press
thats not supported, only button clicks or joining a voice channel
I have seen this in other servers? Is it no longer supported or never was?
I know this bot is used in RL 6mans which is where most people use the option
nope never was an option, probably a different bot
Can I pay for neatqueue admin and he set up the bot in my server ?
Thank You, is there any way I save the old data month to month?
you probably want `/leaderboardconfig monthly`
automatic monthly stats
Oh thank You!!!
If I set it to rolling, will it keep the stats month over month as well as show that current months stats?
Rolling won't reset stats at all, but it will show "snapshots" of the stats for each month
like if you were 1200 MMR in February, 1350 MMR in March, etc
but you won't reset any stats
hey is there a way to link mmr between 3 different queues to one leaderboard?
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
I cant use the command /leaderboard
Even though I voted
It keeps on sending this
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/919709100114346076/1211514376608153632
oh sry
thx:)
Also i wanna ask
How can I reset only the number of game played?
Should I just create another queue
I dont want to reset mmr or other stats
I know this is probably highly unlikely, but is there a way to limit a certain role in the queue?

For instance, we sometimes have 6 goalkeepers join, and that's honestly not good lol. So if we could limit it to, idk, 3, that would be awesome.
Hey, I have a player who left the discord and i need to edit him off the leaderboard but it cant find player so it wont allow me to remove his points
how to a delete him
<@648635725964902411> what is the / to set up MMR Leaderboard>
`/leaderboard`
yes but how do we sync it with a text channel?
<@648635725964902411>
are you talking about when it shows `+4` for the role for example
the leaderboard is always linked to the queue
easy fix would be to add `/rolerequirement add role:@everyone`
so you must be in the server to be on the leaderboard
or you can reset their stats via `/managestats reset player`
and mention them using their ID: `<@123456>` = <@123456>
No. We have 22 people queue up, but if there was a way to limit a role from queueing up, so only 3-4 people with the GK role can be included in that 22.
I don't think I can describe it very well.
are you using `/roles` ?
so how do i fix my queue if it isnt pulling everyone <@145305657237700608>
or do i just completely redo it?
<@648635725964902411>
Do i just redo the whole queue
idk, looks like an issue, some people have said that too
so no fix currently?
what‚Äôs the config
I am wondering how to get neat queue premium, I was trying to make a queue message footer and it says its a premium feature, when I click the link to log in and possibly buy or see what a premium server is I get a blank webpage
when I login  in i am taken to the home screen of the website
are you staff in the server?
admin privillages
goto the dashboard and try clicking the server through there
oh thank you, thats fixed it, something must've been wrong with the dashboard link sent by the bot
We aren't. We just have it set where the channel isn't viewable by people without a certain role.
if each team has a set number of roles, try that out
Broken Open
is what its called
<@145305657237700608> ^
I need a system like a 7v7 and 3v3 mode
how can I setup
<@145305657237700608>
hello, is there a way to import stats from a neatqueue queue to a google spreadsheet?
Check the basic guide on channel's topic
I dont think u can directly, but using the API yeah
ty ty
I cant join with pwrty
party
how can I fix it
Any help with this config?
yes ill check it today
Thank you
having a hard time finding something about this in the documentation, how do i set up a queue to JUST split players into teams and remove extra voting like random/captains, teams valid?, etc.
just change /teamselection
and set it to balance or random if u want, and untoggle /reshuffle
hey i have 3 channels with a different que in each, i want to make a channel where all 3 queues go to one leaderboard and mmr syncs between all, ik about the server stats sync but idk what to do past that, can someone help
i know about leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide toggle:Enabled
<@145305657237700608> any luck
Hello, is there any way to post an overall leaderboard stats? Thank you!
Hello, the /leaderboard command displays an empty leaderboard for our queue.
- We've played several games in that queue and /stats shows the stats correctly.
- I've also voted on TopGG for the server.
Any ideas as to what could be the problem? Is there a way to confirm that the stats are properly saved for the queue? I tried copying it to a new queue but the leaderboard for that queue was also empty.
<@648635725964902411>
Can I ask something
<@145305657237700608>
Have u changed amything related to the leadearboard, like games required or sum
how can I close voice channels
and How can I setup a role for who can jpin queue
Wdym close
bot opens team 1 and team 2 voice channels
I dont want it
<@648635725964902411>
`/voicechannels teamchannels toggle:Disabled`
<@160832426405396480> I know youre having issues, just a quick question. How do you get ‚ÄúValorant MMR Leaderboard‚Äù to display/post. Are you only able to post that when a queue is open?
You can do `/leadearboard` when you have a running queue
it still opens voice channels
So the results once a queue is done will display like this?
You dont want any temp channels? `/tempchannels toggle`
That is just the staff channel
Gotcha, so in order to display ‚Äúthis‚Äù all I have to do is run /leaderboard while a queue is active? Any settings I need to change? Thanks again for your help
If u have already a queue just do /leadearboard
If you want it in another channel you have to link that channel with the queue with /link
<@923026081013977118> sorry just got a chance to check it out
since the lobby channel isnt required to join, it won't forcefully pull people into the channel
thats just how it works currently
how can I set field to be 20 GK to be 2
<@145305657237700608> Can I get your help I need to finish this asap
`/teamsize: 11`, `/roles: GK, Field, Field, Field, Field, Field, Field, Field, Field, Field, Field`
can you join the discord and do it because it doesnt work
thats just the representation of the command
run /teamsize and set it to 11
then the /roles
okay
That's what it says
you are supossed to put arguments in there as my previous message
/roles roles: GK, Field, Field, Field, Field, Field, Field, Field, Field, Field, Field
just copy and run that then
yeah it worked
thanks
need help enabling monthly queues:

so i have a couple leaderboards and a queue each that goes along with them for ranked 1v1 and 2v2 rocket league, but I want to enable monthly leaderboards. How does this work? Will I not know until the 1st of the month? Does it reset the current stats, records, mmr?
Should i start from scratch?
<@648635725964902411>
how can I make a role requirement for queue
I have played around with it a little bit, but the required games was never more than 1
And it never showed before I changed anything for it either
`/rolerequirement add role:` be sure to delete first @ everyone role from the requirement
`/rolerequirement remove role:`
I closed voice channels but it still says this
or something
wdym ‚Äúclosed voice channels‚Äù
Is there a difference between the stats in /setstats and /leaderboard
Leadearboard just displays the info of every player
how can I close captain selection
and balanced selections
votes
<@648635725964902411>
You dont need to ping someone everytime u ask something
`/teamselection set`
I have 2 queue, one 8v8 and the other 6v6. How do I make the table of the 2 queue the same?

that was it! thank you!
my players are complaining about having to vote for winning team after every map, does turning this off just require turning off the MMR system?
Wdym after every map? Do you have a best of?
how can I close captain selections
No, currently this is the loop:
1. queue is 4v4
2. 8 players join
3. they are pushed into their VCs
4. winning team vote starts <-- i want to get rid of step 4.
Don soap I want to make always random teams
how can I setup
he answered that for me earlier
And I dont want captain selections
I just answered u
/teamselection set
which one?
So you basically dont want players to vote for the winner, or am i misunderstanding
press enter on the option and then choose random from the dropdown
Yes, I want to remove the voting step to pick winning team. I imagine this is because MMR tracking is on.
<@648635725964902411>
Which one I need select
sorry but
I need to ask
type `/teamselection set` and press Enter for the dropdown menu, then select Random.
How can I close winner selection
that's what I'm trying to figure out too
I think the surefire way is to redo the queue setup and avoid the MMR questions
but maybe there is a way to turn off MMR in existing queue
You can disable it via `/message winnermessage results`
keep in mind these matches will last the time u set in `/timer matchcleanup`
<@648635725964902411>
Read the message above
bro My brain
I need theese
Team selection random
not captain
Winner selection
Bro are u reading what are we all saying? I already answered all of the questions and needs, if u dont understand then you can go to the [Docs](https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=introduction) or [Basic Guide](https://www.neatqueue.com/guide)
I didn't read this and was wondering how do I tell bot that match ended lol, you nailed the conditionals. Thank you again big dawg.
I'm assuming after the timer, it throws users back to lobby VC?
Ye it ends the match, you cant actually end it or cancel it since theres no output, so u might want change it to `Only staff` rather than `Disabled`
Understood. Everything working as intended now. Big thanks Don ü´°
Is there a way to track the record of captains, separate from their record as players?
Hey, i'm having trouble creating a leaderboard any easy explanation?
Whats confusing?
can u join a call with me and ill explain?
<@648635725964902411>
Call is not really needed, leadearboard just explains itself
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=leaderboard
is there a way to setup a leaderboard that shows everyone in the discord and not just a queue. everytime i try it says "no one in queue"
<@648635725964902411>
Wdym "No one in queue" Leaderboard command does not display that message
or "no queue found"
Makes sense, where are you running this command? If you have a queue, and you use `/leaderboard` outside the queue channel, you will need to `/link` the channel to the queue, then you can execute `/leaderboard`
well my question is can you have a leaderboard that will show even if there is no games queued. I just want it to show everyone in the discord
You need a running **queue**, not a running **match** to display the leaderboard of a certain queue
<@648635725964902411> i got the leaderboard up, now new question is how many channels can u link it to, and how do you change the name of the leaderboard that it displays
I would say you can link  channels to the queue one as much as you want, and the leaderboard name, will be the queue's name
<@145305657237700608> how to do you set a timer for people sitting in a queue
like someone is afk in a 2v2 of mine and wont leave for other to play
Why I get banned ?
`/timer afk`
No need to ping btw
How do I reset the points in a specific queue?
<@145305657237700608> anything?
With the queue?
The broken one I have
<@145305657237700608> it works in every other lobby though?
I don‚Äôt have to be even in the same lobby channel for it to pull me into the new voice channels
that queue config starts automatically
there is no waiting period
I don‚Äôt understand?
Will the bug with the auto role be fixed?
since players are not required to join the lobby channel VC, it doesnt auto drag them
but i have multiple VCs that do not require and they stil auto drag
<@145305657237700608>
it will only drag players to the lobby channel if your /readyup mode is "Join Lobby Voice  Channel"
let me see if i can replicate
<@145305657237700608> it pulls even if it isnt though
in other queues
what config?
what config is what?
broken?
<@145305657237700608> Shouldn't the transcripts show the situation on the match channel to the very end? (https://www.neatqueue.com/transcript/266243131853373440/375)
I don't see all votes on this (and others) transcripts.

Also I see that there are 50 last messages. Why not more? Maybe as a premium feature if not possible for free?
Also would be nice to always see the team summary since the match info that contains the link sometimes show the bugged @2523253463545345 username
Also when flagging the user for voting, would be nice to be able to see in which game (number) he voted wrongly (also here the problem of bugged username exists, knowing the game number would help to know the real name of the player)
i arbitrarily chose 50, it takes time for all the messages to be fetched and save so it just stalls out how long the channel exists for
i can take a look at making it larger though
The messages are not as important to me as to see the not bugged @ usernames and most importantly the final results of the vote. Could you maybe fix this somehow to make sure that the channel is not closed till the final votes are fetched?
I am now investigating a case where players voted wrongly on purpose and that would be very helpful.
currently it doesn't update for the last vote since the message will be deleted, ill change it to always show the final vote update
ok, ill remove the 50 message limit if  `/tempchannels` are enabled, that should be fine
I want to set roles per rank and im getting confused with setting mmr and points, what would be the easiest method to implement this ?
<@145305657237700608> Queue configuration saved as: broken queue
`/autoroles mmr set` You will for example say `Role @Gold` from 100 MMR to 200 MMR then next rank would be `Role @Diamond` from 200 MMR to 300 MMR and like that
perfect thank you
Is there a way to remove a specific persons mmr from the leaderboard, I figured out how to add mmr but I can‚Äôt find the command to subtract it
I set the outcome as a tie but it still gave some players mmr
Nvm I fix it
quick question, everytime someone joins a match it is making a "netqueue reserved channel" for some reason
how do i stop that
these channels keep being made
how do i make them stop
cant stop it, its the only way to allow new matches to be played, since bots can only create a certain number of channels per day in each server
I looked trough a bunch of stuff including here, but is there a way to disable the whole voice channel thing? Just que up, when the que is full, DM the people that it started and just start a new que, no temporary voice channels or requirement to join one.
`/readyup`
Thanks, now need to find the command to disable voice chat creation if it exists
`/voicechannels teamchannels toggle:`
Hm it's still spawning them, maybe it's something else
oh that one is `/lobbychannel toggle`
Thanks, it worked perfectly üëç
how Can I kick someone from queue
`/player remove `
<@648635725964902411> and how can I start a queue without full players
sorry for ping
forcestart
I've set 30 as MMR change. Why does one gain +30.4 and the other two 25.4 / 26.4 ?
if you want it to always be 30, use /mmr change set 30 static:true
and disable /mmr multipliers
I just want it to be the same for all the players
around 30
well those are around 30 already
you can change the /mmr change mode
and make it the same per team
I really need a way to wipe the stats of players who are no longer in the server. Maybe by index on the leaderboard would be possible? People high up on the leaderboard leave the server and take up a space
you can do `/rolerequirement add role:@everyone`
only people with that role will show on the leaderboard, so only people in the server
Oh perfect that works. Thank you
or you can do `/managestats reset player`
if you have their ID
`<@11111>` = <@11111>
Is it possible to have teams with different size in the same queue or multiple queues in the same channel? The game I play has teams with 6 roles, teams with 3 roles and teams with 2 roles
all teams have the same size
how do i give some1 neat Q perms
<@145305657237700608>
like a staff
Is it possible to add multiple queue in the same channel?
`/staffrole`
each channel can only have 1 queue configuration at a time
whats the cmd to delete/cancel the entire queue so it doesnt work anymore
Endqueue
statserver ingame seems broken, I know that it doesn't refresh too frequently due to the discord limitations, but it shows more players than really plays. It shows 36 for my server and the maximum I had in the last 24 hours that really played at the same moment was 20.
Is there a way to change the "Join" button team names to the custom team names?
is this the "Select Team On Join" queue type?
hmm it should be correctly counting all the players in a match
hows it looking right now
Yes.
oh, that would be a bug, ill fix it
it should match the team name
ok will be fixed in tomorrow's update
Thanks you all are the best
done
Why doesn't the bot have the duo option? <@145305657237700608>
for example, in the game league of legends is there the right duo? In some other bots there is also the option, but this one doesn't, is there any way to get it?
I don't know if you understand, but that's it
`/party`
its cuz its not just duos, its any number of people
Is there anyway to remove configs from the /config list?
Nope
Configs are global, not just by server, so they will stay

linked the <#911057745204105237> message to add in an edit where the bot enables the timer after a successful autoping, to prevent ppl from spam pinging ppl
Hello <a:kitty_wave_animated:1055396683275567205> I keep getting this error when the bot tries creating the Lobby VC even though NeatQueue has the Manage Channel permission in the Parent category
Does it have that permission globally? Or does it have another role that‚Äôs overriding its base permission
It does have that permission globally yep
No roles denying it either, but we have it so that it only has the View Channel perm for the Rocket League category

I did some quick searching but might have missed this. What are the free usage limits? Can I only have a certain number of queues active at a time?
nvm I just found it
Yes, free tier can only use 3 queues at once in the entire server, also, other limitations.
Oh I found this
```
Up to 1000 players, 10 different queues, and 250 daily matches. Includes extra customization to the queue message, as well as customizing all the bot's phrases.
```
For the basic plan. Does that need to be updated?
Or is basic above free?
ah 5 credits nvm
Basic is above free, free has limit to 500 players, 3 queues, and 50 daily matches <:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
Hi all, what is the code to see leaderboard of everyone with placing? <@648635725964902411>
leaderboard
how do i disable montly reset?
Just disable it with the same command
but it tells me, one person needs to vote for the server to see leaderboard. does that mean one person need to pay the 2.99?
no, https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/919709100114346076/1211514376608153632
huh, no, it‚Äôs just a vote which is free, doesn‚Äôt say anything about paying
probably bugging, i did the <@857633321064595466> "i vote"
make sure you type it exactly the same then try checking the leaderboard
yes, it works now
thanks
sorry for being annoying, but now it works but the picture stay black. Am i doing something wrong or is it bugged?
has anybody played in that queue
yess, or is it that because i just set it up , now it will start adding it to the leaderboard?

How can I make it so staff can cancel the games
`/staffrole add`
Or `/staffrole command allow`
The team channels permission is not set to the person in the teams
It‚Äôs set to everyone
What should category permissions be like
Or is it another problem
This is the category permissions btw
I accidentally used this cmd
instead of /autoroles mmr set
is there a way to remove my mistake from happening
idk what the default thing is
guys bot opening a queue channel how can I close it
I accidentally ended queue
settings resetted
<@648635725964902411>
what is your question exactly?
I accidentally used /autoroles *games* set, instead of /autoroles *mmr* set
I changed the values to 0, but how can I remove it, completely
just type `/autoroles games` it shows you all the relevant commands
i want cancel
+ auto move start match lobby voice
Is there a way to unlock team channels? Once the game starts it sends people to their respective channels but id prefer if i could unlock said channels so other can join and spectate as its not meant for competitive
`/channel restrictions`
thank you
<@648635725964902411>
Be more specific
I want when the game starts auto move all channel voice
And I want to remove this
`/teamselection`, and youll have to set a lobby channel
`/lobbychannel set` people will get pulled from that channel
okay
Is there a random password?
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobbydetails-set
<@145305657237700608>
the bot doesnt modify category perms
I just want to know what‚Äôs wrong, the newly created team Channels do not have the right permissions
have u touched any permissions or channel restrictions stuff
A few points:
1. Can I use points instead of MMR for ranks, including that rank-up/derank gauge in /stats? I want to use MMR for balancing, and points for number-go-up.
2. Can I configure the bot to ping a role when someone joins the queue while it's empty? (preferably on a cooldown to prevent spam)
3. There seems to be an issue with accessing pages 3 and 4 of /info on my test server (1075219408533868576, queue channel 1075220665361240136) Could someone look into that?
1) /autoroles points
2) /autoping
3) what happens
oh i see, seems its too much info to show, interesting
I know about /autoroles points, but /stats doesn't show a rank-up/derank gauge.
oh, no there is no way to show that currently
welp, off to <#911057745204105237> then...
im not sure how that would work, there are too many autoroles to be able to show them all off
I suppose you could have a command to set what criteria to use for the rank meter.
true
Hello i do /setup and nothing happens it just says starting queue setup
make sure  the bot has permission to send messages
just checking if this was implemented or in the backburner for now.
For some reason whenever we have captains mode with players picking captains we only have 6/8 and sometimes 7/8 for choice, why is this?
Channel restrictions yes, but not for newly created channels, I changed permissions for the queue, staff and results channel
ok so my goal is for the queue channel, results channel to be only visible for the role in `rolerequired` 
and then for team channels to be only visible for the persons on the teams

what should the category permission and channel permission in discord be set to
Channel permision should only be available for the role, you can set that in the channel's setting, thats all
do you mean channels setting in discord or in neatque
Discord
How can I make a channel for just leaderboard
`/link` then u can do `/leaderboard` in the linked channel
what channel I need to link?
queue channel?
Is there any way to rate-limit/implement a cooldown on /autoping? I have one configured for when the queue hits size 1 (i.e. to notify others that someone is looking for a game), and when I repeatedly go in and out of queue, it sends a ping every time. There's a lot of potential for spam without some sort of rate limit.
Is my best bet just to make calling for players manual in a slowmoded channel?

Anyway to stop a queue from auto kicking players after 60 mins of inactivity?
how do i get the Register command to work ?
how can I add mmr points to discord names like;
**selimbeys [1907]**
could you explain more
`/timer queuereset` and/or `/timer afk`
players use `/register` with their account name and it pulls their MMR for that game
`/ratinginname`
but whats format and location
we have our draft set to captains mode, with players voting for the captains, we have 8 people total in the queue, but for some reason when it starts, the choice of players randomly jumps between 6/8 or 7/8 also the 7/8 is not excluding myself
do you have a captains role configured
no, we want to be able to pick anyone in the queue for captain
as it changes constantly and we consistently get new players
coould i just set that to everyone?
the problem here is the choice of captains is only showing 6 or 7, randomly
what is your queue channel ID
the config?
ill grab it one sec
sure thats fine
HKDTV
yea, you have a captains role for the PUGGER role
i just set it to that
which means anyone with PUGGER will be eligible for captain
yeah i get that, but the problem is when we start a queue it's not showing 8 players
only showing either 6 or 7
it randomly shows either 7 or 6 choices
for what?
for the captains role, we have it set to players vote for the captain
probably means not everyone in the queue has that captains role
i just set it to pugger
that confuses me though, why is it picking between 6 or 7
it will only show people who are eligible to be captain
same with if people are in parties
how does it define that, does it have to be a role?
we dont use parties
only the party leader can be captain
its a simple 4v4
the captains role
thats weird because it was showing players without the role as the role was set to nothing
ill give you an update in about 24 hours
now that the role is set
sounds good

Is there any way to allow more than one queue per channel?

I tried seting the /timer afk to "disable" but still have people being removed from the queue for "inactivity". Any thoughts how to fixed it?
did they join queue before you turned the setting off?
it might still kick them
nope didn't fix it
8 players in the queue yet we're only seeing 6 choices
yes i have a role set up
well if it‚Äôs 8 people with 2 captains, it‚Äôs only 6 choices?
Is there a way to let players sub out and put someone in the queue in their place, like how </readyup replaceinactive mode:1197232348937339015> works when a player doesn't check in, instead of having them specify someone to take their place?
they can use `/substitute`
NeatZ
can u check dm please
sure
that requires the user to specify a sub. i mean that the player should just invoke the command, and the system finds a sub for them from the queue, like what happens when you don't check in. (click Ready Up, as in this screenshot)
gotcha gotcha
so players dont have to pick a sub, it can find one
https://tenor.com/view/ok-right-you-right-i-know-thats-right-yas-gurl-gif-15966600435256341061

To show your stats
but  message must be pinned
button falling behind
`/commandbutton create command:/stats` you can create one

how do i check how many people are in the system
for example: 500 people
like that thing
-d serverstats info
Besides the permissions NeatQueue sets up in the role, what other permissions are needed in a role restricted channel it has been added to, in order to work?
I have a category where the **HALO** and NeatQueue roles can view every channel in a category (whereas everyone cannot) and the NeatQueue bot doesn't return the embed messages from a simple **/setup** command.

I have verified that it has all the permissions assigned to the role after invite.
It only works when it has the Administrator permission on its role WHICH I do not want to do.
the problem is it's not letting us pick the other two in the queue, there is meant to be 8 choices, except it randomly sometimes gives us 6 choices and other times 7 choices
when we vote for captains there should be 8 choices
do you have any screenshots of that
the only reasons i can think of it happening are:
- you have a captains role set, and not everyone in the queue has that role
- people in the queue are in a party
<@145305657237700608>
match result not coming to result channel
how can I fix thwt
I have a queue setup but a few members names are randomly showing up as their discord ID. Anyway to prevent this and have it consistent show a member‚Äôs nickname?
Discord thing - nothing we can do
yep if the user is not in your discord client's cache, it will show up as numbers
ive seen it more often on mobile
I need a reminder on how to make sure the new queues have the same permissions as the main queue channel or category. I added a translation bot and gave it permission to see stuff and send messages in both the category and the main queue channel, but it doesn't appear to be getting allowed into the created queue channels.
can the bot be set up without creating channels and vc's? I want people to click the button to join the queue, and click a button to say they're ready. The created vc's cause problems for those on xbox
the text channels don‚Äôt inherit the category permissions directly
you can use /tempchannels permissions to manually change anything though
sure you can use /voicechannels teamchannels and /lobbychannel
toggle them all off
can  u change the amounts of player who need to vote on /cancel? cause its 6 plaeyrs queue and when its gets 4 votes its freezes( no one ele can vote), and game doesnt cancel
4 votes would be majority so makes sense it ends the vote
but yes, /requiredvotes
but it doesnt cancel the game
what did the votes look like
4 yes 0 no
screenshot?
dont have rn cause i enden uip canceling manually with outcome cancel
I appreciate it
`/outcome selectwinner` might be another option for you
that screenshot is showing i posted before is showing only 6 choices, i am positive everyone has the role, and we don't use parties
how can I do results like this
<@145305657237700608>

I have a queue with roles: Goalkeeper/Defense/Attack. I would like Goalkeepers to always be captains. Is this somehow possible? <@145305657237700608>
you can add a /captains role, but it‚Äôs by discord role
<@145305657237700608> I noticed that some games are not stored in the admin log of games. Should canceled games be there? I need to analyze a chat from one game and it is not in the log (no one deleted it, I checked). And I see this for more games.
Even if a game is canceled, I still need a log of it (to analyze banable behavior).
is there a way to add varying entry cost depending on your rank/role (you lose mmr when you join the queue, but if you win you get more mmr back so you end up in positive)?
?reshuffle
-d reshuffle
whats captain reshuffle

How do we make it look like this
When ours looks like this
As u can see, the commands are different

Is there a way to create an embed of the leaderboard to put on our own website?
<@145305657237700608>
the website leaderboard or the discord image one
Watcher isn't publishing alerts in <#992610856904957992>. They're being posted in the channel, but they aren't showing up in channels that follow <#992610856904957992>.
If there isn't an option to publish these alerts from within Watcher, maybe get Auto Publisher set up?
are you aware of any?
the captains role is set to everyone, there is no reason why it is only showing 6 or 7 other than it must be bugged
<@145305657237700608> The min limit of MMR in my queue is 1000, but 2 players were able to go below 1000, probably because I canceled a game and their points were removed from them. I think in such case the min MMR limit should still apply.
without any screenshots or anything i can‚Äôt help much
and the game number as well
why did they lose MMR from cancelling?
If they won a match and got points and then I canceled the match, I think the players who won lose points. Isn't this the case?
that is true yea
gotcha so maybe it was reverted after they had lost more MMR, so it reverted them even lower
<@145305657237700608> Is there any way to confirm that monthly leaderboards are enabled? I would like to make sure that I enabled this option.
will grab you it soon
bot broke
DDYVL is the config number, and here is the screenshot, this captain selection needs to include EVERYONE but it only has 6, sometimes it gives us 7, but usually 6 the captain role is set to @ everyone so everyone should be in there but they are not
and no we are not using parties at all
wait i think that's the wrong screenshot one second
ok it seems to be fixed, i didn't view it last night but it seems setting the role to @ everyone has fixed it, if i have anymore issues i'll come back
that ss was player selection not captains, oopsies
those have been toggled off, and this still wants us to join a vc
what‚Äôs ur config
is this what you need? `NNZVM`
yes i‚Äôll check
thank you
yes in /info
i believe
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to test the neatqueue bot alone without any other people, just to see if everything is set up correctly?
-d test
thanks
I am making a 60 player Q and after the 45th or so person in Q there is this weird spavin inbetween, thought I should let you know
yea each embed ‚Äúfield‚Äù as they are called has a max size
so it spans 2 fields to fit it all
I see, also is there a way to have the bot only create the text channel where you can ping all the players but not create the vc where everyone would need to join?
Is there a way to filter output from `/api/history` to only include matches played within a certain date range? With limited bandwidth, I really don't want to download the whole haystack to get the needle.
not currently
it does need some updates for sure
I know just where to go then.
needs to be updated to be paginated as well
Heya, looking for a specific set up and wanted to see if anyone already knew
I want to set up a queur to pop when 2 people with the [captain] role join the queue and when 8 people with the [draft] role join a queue. Basically a 0/2 slot for captain, and 0/8 slot for drafts
I was looking there and I am unable to see it there.
If I would set the monthly stats again to make sure it is set, is this not going to mess in any way with the existing MMR people have and the leaderboard?
you can check the leaderboard and see if there is a month selection option
to see if monthly is on
but enabling monthly mid-month will start a "new month" so the stats will be empty
you can use `/roles`
-d roles
this is perfect, thanks!!
Could it also be possible to force the match to set up two teams of 1/4 randomly? I was thinking of doing /captains role [captain] but then they would have to still pick 4 players
-d /teamselection
-d /teamselection set
Hmm yeah, captains will still work for sure, I was hoping I could have it be random but with 1 [leader] from the /roles above
Not a huge deal tho
if its random, then the captains are useless
I need help
For some reason my leaderboards arnt working and it‚Äôs telling me to vote and I vote so they can come back up and they just don‚Äôt show up even tho I voted
type `@NeatQueue#0850 i voted` in your server chat
THANK YOUUU
I CAN START MY 6 MANS UP AGAIN
APPRECIATE
https://www.neatqueue.com/lb/5v5_

I don't see it but probably because this is the first month?
When I was testing before the start of the rankings there was the month selection option
it would still show iirc
Could you maybe somehow check it on your site for me?
maybe not
check in discord
Ok thank you, I see March 2024 too
Hi i was making the bot work but everytime we choose to random and captain it keeps choosing captains regadless of the choice. it loops for 4 times and then chooses
> we choose to random and captain it keeps choosing captains regadless of the choice
could you explain what you mean
When we choose the team by captain and then random captains it kept repeating the option if the 2 captains were good but kept going 4 times until it went to player choice
yes, you pick if you want to get 2 new random captains or not
yes but even when we choose to keep them it takes 2 new ones
screenshot?
yea, exactly
you voted to randomize captains
6 yes, 0 no
ooooooh
lmaoo that makes so much more sense
thanks for that made a lot more sense now
can i use my own pictures or do i have to post them someowhere for the banners of the queue?
the queue message picture and thumbnail stuff
<@145305657237700608>
basically can i inject png or jpeg files in within linking them from a post or image online
You can use wathever u want
Just needs full url
right but i dont have url ? do I?
i mean if i took a picture of myself could i just put it in there? bc ive been usinng url from x posts ive made
You can upload it to `imgbb` and it generate a link for your image
or even discord i think
actually those links expire now nvm
NeatQueue: Invalid image URL! Make sure the URL is a direct link!
i tried every version
post it here
[url=https://ibb.co/Nnmp2k7][img]https://i.ibb.co/Nnmp2k7/Major.png[/img][/url]
ahhh
take off the front and back ends?
https://i.ibb.co/Xk3pxdV/Major.png
`https://i.ibb.co/Xk3pxdV/Major.png`
is what you want, the direct image link
wait what?
how did you get that
What did u copy from the website
says it doesnt exist
when i clikc it
Wdym
like where did you get tha link
i dont have that link
where did you get that link
You probably changed embed codes in the website
i didnt
idk how to lmao
That dropdown
yea you got the wrong link at first
but you can get the direct link by right clicking
how can i reset the system to not have 1000 players registered and only the people who join q?
When you join a queue you get registered, thats by default
A way to reset, is doing an overral reset
-d managestats reset all
-d roles
https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/March/29/624_Discord_07h-54m_317x310.png
Looks a bit weird when I use the direct role, is this the way it's supposed to be?
its not meant to be a discord role, just a name
its not linked to discord roles
<@145305657237700608> there is no way to disable "creata a vc" when Queue pops, or is there? I only know about toggle vc per team
i cannot display my mmr in the name like as example: Satoru (1000)

Could somebody help me with that one pls?
-d lobbychannel toggle
does it work for everyone else?
if you are the server owner, its not possible to nickname you
Yea. But for normal players it dont work either.
And i cannot make a -d test too rn.
did you enable it?
yes with -d ratingname toggle enabled

and as format i used this -d ratinginname format ($) prefix
commands are used with `/`
`/ratinginname`
yea ik did that on my server thought maybe i cannot write the commands with / here (But dont have perms so it was a logic issue on my side xd)
the command would still pop up
all the commands are visible
okay.
fixed it had a logic problem rn. Anyway thanks!
ah yes i forgor but now i get the team selection voting but also want to turn that off if possible, cant find a setting
-d teamselection set
Thank you so much
hello
How can I add role requirements for queue
how do i make where i can see who joined que
for matchmaking
`/rolerequirement add`
Disable /anonymous queue
thanks, also how do i get to where it sends the match overview to the admin chat where they void the match or change the winner
You need to set the /staffchannel
hey, anyone knows how i can allow anyone to make their own ques so it doesn't have to be admins only?
Do u create a queue and delete it after a match is done or wut
how do i move the leaderboard into a new channel
with all the settings i have
for a current leaderboard channel
or how do i know what settings i have for it atm
I broke my leaderboard i think, only the first page of the MMR leaderboard is broken, everyone else can see it but me;maybe because I‚Äôm on mobile discord
you might need to make sure its linked but you could also have a required amount of games
It works for everyone but me, it‚Äôs probably a visual glitch cause Page 2-6 still work and all the other category‚Äôs completely work it‚Äôs just the first page for MMR that‚Äôs bugged, I‚Äôve made several configs over the past couple months but this is the first time I‚Äôve had this glitch
anyone know how to delete commands ment to be scheduled for leaderboards??/
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>
Is there any way to change players names on the leaderboard?
oh yeah... i do end up deleting it after a match, which is something i shouldn't have done
i dont get the setup??
<@145305657237700608> sorry to bother you but is there a way to make a rank role that is tied to a certain number of mmr you get? so in order to get a certain rank role in the server, u can set up a command where the player has to reach that certain mmr to get it?
`/autoroles mmr set` & `/rolerequirement`
Check neatqueue perms to send messages and embed links
thank you so much man, is there anyway i can donate to you guys when the time comes?
Sure, here is
Not really
`/schedule delete` ?
W, when i get my money up, I will be donating
Also put this in feature requests
thanks it was the embed role that wasn't enabled by default
how would i get the neat queue bot to send the results from each game into a seperate channel from the leaderboard and join queue?
-d resultschannel
whats a good way to test if the  queue works and goes though?
-d test
We've been getting a bug where the queue fills up, but then clears the queue without making a match or anything like that. It's not every time, but it's happening enough that it's noticeable.
Hola tengo un problema con el bot. ¬øAlguien sabe c√≥mo eliminar The waiting lists are that it appears that I already have the 3 but I don't have any
<@145305657237700608> sorry to bother but just following up on this - just a response would be appreciated for now
no update atm sorry
hey do you know how i can limit the voting phase to only captains and auto teams
just to
auto teams?
i mean just to this
also do you know why this happens?
-d teamselection set
yes, the free tier only allows 3 different queue channels
i just invited the bot to the server
before i was doing some tests but i kicked him and invited  again
how can i delete those supposed three queues?
i need help
how can i delete those supposed three queues?
use /endqueue in the channels you started queues
Cant seem to load the leaderboard can you help <@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>
Just keep trying
any thoughts on adding the leaderboard underneath the queue? <@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> ?
just a link to the website?
yup would be clean and seamless and no one would have to do / leaderboard or make a channel for it <@145305657237700608>
they obviously could do it if they wanted but makes it super easy to access even for new people
yup i think its a good idea
Hey, is there any way to do a PUG style/Matchmaking style, highest MMR players automatically become captains within a player draft pick, where they choose their players from the pool of players signed up, **HOWEVER**, the player pool not being restricted to the max of players required in a game.

In other words, can you have an unlimited player pool and then select your 10 players (in a 5v5 setup)

*example*
17 players sign up, and then the host of the game decides to start the game, the bot chooses the two highest MMR players to become captain, and they then proceed to pick the remaining members for their teams.
not currently
a match is always created with at most the number of people in a game
so if its 5v5, it will always include only 10 people
this is mostly by design, to prevent people from constantly being not picked and unable to play
everything else you can do though, matchmaking, highest MMR players captains, etc
Thank you for the fast reply
Is it possible to reset the stats after a specified period and not only after 1 month?
no not automatically
you would have to manually run the reset command
Okay still thank you.
sis there a function to set up teams?
and like have team names and stuff
How do I set up a queue so when the maximum number of people join it randomly selects the people and create 2 new voice channels for the separate teams and automatically moves them to said channels?
An example would be max number of people 8. 
4 on each team 2 teams
`/setup`
for just random, change your
-d teamselection set
how do i see stats
<@145305657237700608> I have some urgent problem. The first month of rankings will end soon on my server (the timezone is ET I think), but people stopped getting points after the queues end (Queue#1038 and newer). Could you maybe check why?
There is no log chat too and all the buttons are active. Players also complain that they got no points.
It seems broken and it seems like it stopped working after 0:00 CET time, so some minutes ago
Match channels are closed and when I manually put the queue ID in the log link then I can see the chat and that the player voted, so the game ended properly but was not counted by the bot
And I now have many games like that and more will come
that match does not say it is complete
is there a function to set up teams?
and like have team names and stuff
https://www.neatqueue.com/transcript/266243131853373440/1038
The match channel is closed
Every game since then is like that
The problem is that the first month of rankings will end in a few hours and if this will be fixed after this, I am afraid that this may not be reflected in the final leaderboard of the month.
Also I have no way to do anything, you are the only hope
I manually put the ID to this chat transcript and it works, but the link is not visible in the admin log too.
The fact that transcript exists probably confirms that the match ended and the vote succeeded, but something went wrong after that.
Players in queue 1040 say they can't vote, so now it is some other problem
hmm i do see that node 1 went down unexpectedly 20 mins ago
Also I see this
But my timezone is ET, so the first month should not end yet
your timezone is set to Europe/Warsaw
I see, I don't remember changing it and I don't see any place where I can check it (I don't see this on /info)
yea looks like its not in /info
<@145305657237700608> It seems like the game 1040 was closed properly, but 1038 and 1039 remains unclosed. I am not sure what to do.
I can check the transcript and press the proper button to point who won, but if the leaderboard of the month is already over, will it add the points to the closed leaderboard?
it might not even work
im not quite sure, since it seems it broke mid-way through resolving the match
you can try, but yes it would go on the leaderboard of when it started
1038 would be for March
I tried, the error is "Could not find the match channel. Perhaps it was deleted?"
yea you will need to manually add stats if you want
Any way to manually add the points to the leaderboard of the March?
Could you point me how?
And will it count for March?
i guess if you change your timezone then use `/add mmr` and such, it should work
since it would see it is march again
but anyone that had stats roll over to april will get weird
cuz their april stats are already started
I will just add the points outside the leaderboard I guess
https://www.neatqueue.com/lb/5v5_
I don't see month tabs here, while already some games from new month were played and ended
hmm seems the leaderboard endpoint does not include the timezone adjustment
What does it mean in practice?
The games people play right now will count for the new month or for March?
the new month
its just the website thinks its still March
I see
cuz it doesnt check the server's timezone
Here in the discord preview the March is not able to load, April works properly
click the image and hit "Open Link"
Thank you for your help.

One last question. Was this a random situation or something like this may happen by the end of each month?
likely random, im not sure the cause of the outtage yet
is there a way to add a ref to the matchmaking
im trying to make it 4v4 with a ref
Have a question i tried now the autorole feature out and sometimes the bot dont remove the old role. Did i configurate something wrong?
When i give me more MMR to achieve the new role he removes the previous role.

Like as example:

Bronze 1000MMR -> 2001 Silver -> 3001 Gold -> 4001 Platinum -> 5001 Diamond

When i enter Silver he dont remove Bronze. But when i enter Gold after Silver he removes Bronze. So it seems he deletes the previous rank but only after the next rankup.
Still not working bud. It has been like that for a week
show your config in /info
leaderboard works, make sure there is a queue and the bot can send messages
How can i add mmr?
-d add mmr
But it doesnt Work when i write /add mmr @role
It still tells me to add one
Ouh okay
I understand now
Thank you
But what Types of mmr are there
mmr is matchmaking rating, or elo
Is there a way to have it set to **__GK 0/2__** with **__Util 0/20__** or similar, instead of me needing to have 10 different roles that are the same?
`/roles roles:GK,Util,Util,Util,Util...`
I could kiss you
Thank you!!
I've voted and am still getting this message
<#919709100114346076>
What should I show there? I did /info on my server now
Bot not showing stats saying 1 user needs to vote to unlock but everyone has and yet it's still not working.. saying the same thing
<@145305657237700608> help please if you not too busy

Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
is there a way to add a match win to some people so it comes up on the leaderboard?
`/add win`
and is there a way to disband all parties
does the mmr add depend on how much mmr you have?
yes it adds on top
When add scrim matchmaker?
inter server
matches
between teams
how do i disable testing mode?
-d test
just use it again and it will disable
i tried that it didn't work i had to to a config load to get rid of it
it works , you just have to interact with the queue again to see any difference
is there  way to get the messages to autodelete once the queue is done?
does mmr go to every queue or just the one you played in
Hello, I try to access the server leaderboard but it asks me to vote on top.gg, even though I've already done so. And is it possible to join the same voc when a 1v1 is created, for example?
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/919709100114346076/1211514376608153632
and how do you delete all parties
is there a way to have the queue history sent to a different channel to keep track of them?
Hi, lobbychannel timer in test mode is not currently set at 300s ? Because i'm everytime canceled after waiting 5 secondes and i receive a mp which indicates that i'm currently banned from queuing since 2 min, 3 min, etc.
yes, test mode has reduced timers
for the normal winner message, /resultschannel
for a staff specific version, /staffchannel
no, but if you use /tempchannels, the channel will be deleted
the specific queue you played in
Not giving roles when they get to the mmr dictated, did I do something wrong?
cause the leaderboard changes for all
Will neatqueue
ever add
inter server
matchmaking?
It already has
-d queuetype
i mean
look at my <#911057745204105237> ill write it there
not planned currently
are you thinking of adding it in future?
im in a 1000 player base community
for a football game
this would greatly help
scrims
honestly
even if you add it
as a premium access
im definitely buying it bro
not at the moment, no plans and not thinking about it
would be quite a bit of work and i don‚Äôt know how popular it would really be
Damn could you poll it?
at the moment i will have to say no, it would be cool, but it would be a massive undertaking for me
understandable
larger bots run across multiple machines where each machine manages different discord servers
so it would be complicated to get working honestly
hi do you know with what command users can get their elo on their discord tag
like this
`/ratinginname`
<@145305657237700608> Would be great if players banned from discord would not disappear from the leaderboards from previous months. I today banned a player and I noticed that he disappeared from the March leaderboard.
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>
uhh no clue why it is not working, should be fine i guess
Would there be any way to remove someone from the queue? for example, someone entered the queue in someone else's place, would it be possible to remove that person?
Yas, `/player remove`
thanks
Hello, back again with the weird queue, so despite having set the forcestartconfig to min:10 and auto_start:True, once the queue fills with 2 captains and 8 league players, the queue still does not start - I was wondering if this is due to the way the teams are set up? https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/April/02/650_Discord_19h-29m_350x322.png
Hello, is there a way to skip the que voice chat after we have selected teams, like as soon as we chose teams it puts us in our team voice chat? Thank you
hello
forcestart is not the normal way to start a match
by default it starts when the queue fills
that‚Äôs usually how it works, it creates the team channels after teams are made , what do you see
which perms do i need to grant to the bot, ive given it the manage channels permission yet it says it is missing manage channels permission
Yeah the queue isn't starting when it fills though so I have to force start it
same with me, but it says cant start coz doesnt have the perms, im pretty sure ive given it the perms
did you change any settings?
Not home right now to check but it's very possible, I'll remake the queue when I'm back to clean slate it
maybe you changed your
-d matchstart when
<@145305657237700608> Hi, how can we delete previous queues when i've deleted channels where my queues were before end them properly ? Now i'm limited at 3 queues at same time and can't load them. I've tried to remove/add NeatQueue bot but the issue still. I just need one queue btw for my actual server. Ty !
This is my actual configlist if it helps. Also before it happens, i wasn't able to link any queue on a leaderboard. It was saying none queue was found while i've one active queue..
configs are different from actual queues, it‚Äôs just the settings
if you do /serverstats info, it should show the queues active
so what can i do to delete those queues ?
what‚Äôs the issue exactly
i've deleted channels where my queues were before end them properly so I can't delete them anymore and now i'm limited at 3 queues at same time when i try to load. I've tried to remove/add NeatQueue bot but the issue still. Any ideas ?
if the channels were deleted it should have deleted the queues
Anyway if i'm trying to setup or load i have this message
It means that the previous queues aren't deleted ?
It creates a single voice channel first, and when everyone joins it then splits us up into 2 voice channels. I was hoping the moment we finish joining Team 1 and 2 that it automatically puts us in voice channels 1 and 2
And sometimes when we join the single voice channel, when it splits us up, someone doesn‚Äôt get put into thier team channel, it kicks them out. They usually join a random channel and I have to manually move them
you can disable the /lobbychannel
seems to be so yea
try now?
It works ty üòâ
What did you do ?
restarted, seems to be an issue with queues getting stuck when the channel is deleted
Is there a way to make a sample queue for new members in discord? Basically an intro/practice queue?
Wouldnt just that create a normal queue but its just separate stats or even just not mmr <:hmm:1172617247320195123>
Right. But I would like it to run through the whole shebang
Like as if there was a full team there
Hello, is there an option to reduce the time when making captains, it takes one minute by default, i would like to change it to 20 seconds
Another thing <@145305657237700608> when someone don't push the ready button after waiting the lobbychannel timer an error occur and the queue still like this :
yea i noticed that error come up
bug with the automatic requeue and tempchannels disabled
yo do u know how i can increase the mmr of certain players?
ok nvm I got an idea
`/add mmr`
noted
Hello, is there an option to reduce the time when making captains, it takes one minute by default, i would like to change it to 20 seconds ‚òùÔ∏è
Also, do you know how I can make the votes of who won the game be done by only one administrator?
`/timer votes`
`/message winnermessage results value:Staff Only`
thanks!
then how can i set the wins and lose
after this
Set a `/staffchannel` to control it easier or `/outcomeselect winner`, but i recommend setting a staff channel
yeah i see it
thanks
<@145305657237700608> What is in the Professional plan for 20 credits
We need it if we have over 1000 members in our server? or in the system?
Up to 5k players, unlimited queues, and 1k daily matches
players are different from members in your server
Is there a way to not create voice channels if we use the ready button instead ? And is there a way to put results in threads instead of channels ?
sorry to bother u but i have used the /add mmr command and then added the user i wanted to give mmr to and specified the role. but for some reason it keeps saying You must specify one of user and role
Hello, I have neat queue in my server, and currently I have 3 different queues based on ranks, that have rank requirements in order to join each queue, that said, I have had to activate shared stats, and was wondering if I could make a queue that would not impact these stats, within the same server.

more of a "casual" queue.
Is there a way to not create voice channels if we use the ready button instead ?
-d lobbychannel toggle
if you enabled serverwide stats, you will need to disable it, then configure the other queues to share stats again
You can just put the mmr ammount to add and the @ of the user, you must be filling the parameters wrong?
Thank you! How would I do so?
<@145305657237700608><@648635725964902411> how work **/register** , webhook ... ?
`/register` works if you have `/requireregister`
oke, how work ``/requireregister :mode (Custom URL) or (Manuall)`` idk how work, i would like to connect ``dota 2/steam/dotabuff/stratz`` , something between all this
you would need to set up your own server to respond to webhooks from bot
someone used /register, it sends a webhook to you, you respond with the starting MMR
i can set up dota2 if there is an API to check ratings
I'm not good at code, can you tell me exactly what you need? , there are APIs different from the site that delivers information about players, matches and so on, mmr or rank should also be there. This **https://docs.stratz.com/index.html**
Seems like that one is outdated, they now use graphql one
i can take a look this weekend
<@145305657237700608> anyway to check which members have a diff MMR than tehir nickname? I have a couple of inidviduals that show 24 for example next to their name but if they dont pkay for awhile and they decay to 20 it doesnt show up then they cant queue. The cant queue part is fine but the namechange is the problem
<@648635725964902411> do multipliers stack?
I have no clue, but my guess is no <:Shrug:1171270284670668830>
things like streak and placement multipliers stack yes
multiple role multipliers don‚Äôt stack, it‚Äôs whatever one is highest
My guess was out
does decaying not update nicknames?
<@145305657237700608>
i‚Äôll have to test
Is there a way to ping a different text channel automatically when a queue has started
having trouble directing traffic to the queue text channel
What format does `/api/history/$server_id` take for the `start_date` and `end_date` parameters? I tried giving it ISO 8601 in the Swagger UI, but it still returned every single match that was played in my testing server.
And, there is NO schema for what the endpoints are supposed to return. At all. It's all just strings. As a stickler for type safety, that's not very fun to deal with.
Hey I reset my leaderboards but it didn‚Äôt reset the names of everyone so everyone still has there old elo next to their names, how can I fix this?
it should be an ISO datetime
i‚Äôll try and improve the api docs some more overall
example: 2008-09-15T15:53:00+05:00
yo how do i reset everyones mmr, i have used the **/managestats reset mmr** command but I don't think it's the right one. how do i reset everyones mmr without having to use roles?
Thats the right command
then whats the right command to reset everyones mmr to a specifc number i want then?
-d set mmr
thank u
np, give it a role istead of user
I'm using these exact parameters, and I'm still getting the entire history.
hmm if it‚Äôs not erroring then it‚Äôs formed correctly, must be something else happening
i can check tomorrow
Hello, I've been setting up the bot for a couple of days now. I'm not sure what I changed to make it give out error codes now since I've done a few things and tried reverting back what I've done. The last error code I got was  OKOCG.
captain selection doesn‚Äôt work if you have only 1 player
Oh ok thank you!
how can I do 2 queues but 1 leaderboard
I just created one more queue
then this happened
<@648635725964902411>
Is it possible to create an ‚Äúachievement‚Äù based system based on total games played, wins, mvps, etc
I have an idea to create a role that triggers said achievement. But is there an option in the bot to auto role based on that criteria
<@145305657237700608>
Where are u running the command
You mean get a "role" based on MMR or Wins etc?
I need just connect 2 queue to 1 leaderboard
Are those the only two options currently? There not a total games played or total mvps?
Thats why i typed *etc*
`/autoroles` youll see the options
Youll need to share stats
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).

our main leaderboard 4v4
i will connect 7v7 mode too
Do I need to do
Sharedstats enabled ** name:**
4v4?
Hi <@145305657237700608> ! Is it possible to give points to players for a tied game ?
<@648635725964902411> hi sorry for ping
if a match is running
how can i end it
without punishments
just end it
`/outcome cancel` (Admin) or `/cancel` (Votes)
thanks
one more thing
`/add points`, but no i dont think so
How can I activate the option for captains to be re-elected?
`/captains reshuffle` This only works if the captains were selected randomly
do you know why the bot sometimes doesn't move the users into their vcs?
No clue, are these roles above the neatque role?
So when doing the winrate autorole, if the user has a 100% winrate it wont role them
how can i make the autorole work so that 100% also autoroles
cannot yet
Hmm could be related to perms not sure at all
constantly getting this but neatqueue has this role in the server
i‚Äôll have to fix, i forgot the upper bound is not included, and it‚Äôs not possible to set it to above 100%
yeah i was just like what the heck LOL
is that a quick fix or one ill have to wait for?
will just have to wait unfortunately
since there‚Äôs no way to include 100 atm
Another question, how does adding a webhook work? Ik how it does with other things, just unsure with how it works with NeatQueue <@145305657237700608>
like how it‚Äôs added, or what data it sends?
What it sends through the webhook vs what is sent through neatqueue bot
it sends events for when a player joins queue, leaves queue, a match starts, teams are created, and a match is finished
containing info like game numbers, channel ids, players, and teams
Where does the info send?
I created and added one but I see no info lol
it would send to whatever url you provided
Yeah idk if im doing this right, I copy the webhook url and nothing sends to it xD <@145305657237700608>
what are you testing with
<@145305657237700608> Yo, we have a problem on our end, people are getting kicked due to inactivity after just 50 seconds
When we always had it set to 60 min
And no1 changed it
what does it say
I think I got it tho, I changed the timer myself, but someone said they didnt change it
is there a way to check logs or smth?
-d logs
a discord webhook
and i just run a test queue
yea that won‚Äôt work
it‚Äôs not formatted specially for discord
Oh so what webhook do I need?
Like where can I output it to xD
Sorry to sound dumb I promise I'm not LOL
https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-a-webhook
something like https://webhook.site would be an easy way
So basically what I am asking is where can I use this
not sure what you mean
you would use it in your own application to do stuff when the bot sends a webhook
example: show the number of active players on your own website
if you aren‚Äôt developing something, they aren‚Äôt helpful to you
bingo
thats all i needed to hear ü§£
Hmm what does this message mean? I have premium for the bot, do I need some other kind of premium?
I would also like to report a bug, this person has more games in the stats than he should
This bot has nothing to do with neatqueue
Right my bad, the commands are the same, sorry for posting this.
When he checks (by clicking "show my stats") stats show 220 matches, when I check it shows 120
Is there a way to copy the bot settings to a other discord server ?
/config save and load
Thanks
How i can do this like this and if i win u gonna get more by the bot
ping me if i got repsond
`/ratinginname`
ty bro
seems like using the command does not show alltime stats
so thats a bit weird, one shows monthly one shows all time
format or what option?
i just get this
And how can i upload the save file to a different discord?
use the same config code
When u hit `/config save` it will drop out a code, or the desired name u set it to, then that code can be loaded from whichever discord server that has neatqueue with `/config load`
okay thanks
how the bot can auto give role when somebody gonna have like 100 mmr for the gold rank
`/autoroles mmr set `
how i can setup the leadboard for the mmr
<@648635725964902411>
<@145305657237700608>
Stop pinging
You have a basic guide in this channel's topic
Has anyone played yet
<@648635725964902411> mines doing the same and we played like 5 series
And it‚Äôs only 1 required game
website show the same?
how i can setup this? to toggle channel
-d tempchannels toggle
how i can when the queue gonna start the bot gonna give role
`/autoroles ingame`
still not working the voice channel still create
why its not workingj
voice channel is
-d lobbychannel toggle
yo NeatZ why somebody when join the server dont get in the nickname discord server an mmr rate
cuz they havent queued
nvm they get
btw how i can get mmr rate in my nickname
why that created
by default people usually want voice channels
these are part of the /setup
i dont see that
oh i remember
but i clicked no
or myabe in this setup
-d voicechannels
but how i can add mmr rate to my nickname
if you are the server owner you cant
i think i have lifehack
<@145305657237700608> what if im gonna give my crown to my alt acc and im gonna join back and im gonna get my crown back
its gonna work?
if you are the server owner, the bot cant change your name
im gonna just maybe give the crown to my alt acc and its gonna work
how i can do for the bot
the queue its always gonna be captain
2 captains
without choosing
The same 2 captains always?
no
wait no
when
u can choose unfair mode or maybe other
i wanna always captain mode
`/teamselection set `
Hey guys üôÇ - How often do MMR AUtoroles Sync ? I have e.g 800+ MMR but got the role from the range of 0-399 MMR üòÑ
That shouldnt happen
<@648635725964902411>  do you have access to configs ?
so you could check mine, I did doo it definitely right üòÑ
Do /info and go to the 8th page
those are all for games played lol
Looks like you set it to games and not for MMR <:sadcat:1179569615911800842>

it needs to be a direct url to the image
Already tried that too
same Issue <:PepeCry:1071821198763245630>
lemme see
yea that is strange
i guess try a different image host, maybe something is going on
I will try another one üôÇ Let me check
https://tenor.com/view/dj-khaled-another-one-gif-26093316
```https://imguploader.de/image/9luov``` does also not work - do you have any image host which will work for sure ?
or .gif
let me double check
Also not working üòÑ
Either the bot is trolling me or literally .gifs do not work, but they work in any other embeed but it could be limited by your DB settings or whatever that .gifs just are not allowed <@145305657237700608>
you are saying gifs work in other commands?
or they just dont work at all
Yo yo yo
We can do gifs in the QUEUE? (Nvm looks like that‚Äôs a no per the statements above^)
Blank leaderboard still
it was just the uploaders // I uploaded it on my website and then it worked fine
<@923026081013977118>  it works
But strangely on some common upload sites like imgur, ibb, etc. those links do not work.
why he dont get the role
i mean bronze role
Would anyone be around to answer some really basic / dumb questions about neatqueue? I'm trying to figure out if it fits the needs for the server its being used on...
Wondering...

* Is a "queue" a single match? Or is it a container for multiple matches?
* Is it possible to have multiple queues / matches forming simultaneously in the same text channel?
Really we're looking for a bot where a user can say "start a game" and then other people can click "join" to create an easy list, but ideally with the option of having multiple matches able to form concurrently, etc.
- container for multiple matches is a good way to put it. You create a queue, which will continuously create matches when the queue is filled
- you can have 1 queue configured per channel, but there is no limit to how many matches can run at the same time
Can you have multiple matches *forming* at the same time in the same queue?
like

Match A: 3/4 players

Match B: 5/6 players

etc.
no, only 1 match being formed at a time
you would need multiple queue channels for that
hmm ok
thanks
maybe they are a higher role than the bot
Hi <@145305657237700608> I was wondering if it was actually possible to display points instead of mmr in resultschannel at the end of a game ?
no thats not possible
Ok ty ! And it will not be planned too ?
probably not, basically everything revolves around MMR, that would just be 1 small place
Ok ty for the answer üòâ
is there a way to add ranks for mmr
-d autoroles mmr set
what command is it to set it
its right there
he just showed u
i was bein dumb sorry
it's calm but u might not wanna behave dumb as it can annoy the dev and mod
Anything I can do here?
Really hard to tell, since you will need to check all the perms
<@857633321064595466> perms
> ### Why am I getting a permissions error?
> There is various reasons that can raise this error, please make sure to check the following points to solve it:
> - The bot has the necessary permissions.
>   - The bot can send messages and manage channels.
> - If you assign a role to the bot, ensure it doesn't overwrite the bot's permissions.
> - Category and channel permissions do not override the bot's permissions.
>   - If the category or channel is private, add the bot to it through the settings.
> **Fast fix:** Give the bot administrator permissions.
<@648635725964902411> everytime we win a match and vote for the winner, they not gaining mmr, the score keeps staying at 0.0
i didnt mean too sorry
btw why is my leaderboard working on the website but it is showing a poo icon on discord
<@145305657237700608>
what config have you changed?
/ mmr change set  amount:44.7 loser_mmr:29.5 static: true
any1 know?
do u know the solution?
share your config code
`/config save`
Would you guys please send me the link to the translations? polish is still not looking good and i need to check smth
i don't think i have a code
<@145305657237700608> so sorry i was being dumb. here: 2mans queue
2nd Config code: 4mans queue
worked fine for me
https://crowdin.com/project/neatqueue
i see, alr thanks for the clarification, i dunno why it was doing 0.0 for the wins, maybe its cuz i had it on different settings in 2 diffferent queue channels
Can you send me an example!??
<@145305657237700608> all of the leaderboards show a poo emoji on discord but work on the website (only for mmr leaderboard) do you know why
if you click the image, can you "Open Link"

<@145305657237700608>
how someone can join queue

its broke game
im not understading whats wrong

Thank you!
Is there a way 2 teams to vote? Bc rn only 1 team can vote (My settings are teams random so no captain)
Vote what
Is their a way to pull my server stats for number of games played, # of players, to a csv file?
also my queues seem to have frozen, and wont let me join or leave, or its not updating as such. is there was to refresh
mine also, I was trying to fix it
but everything I tried didn't work, and I might have made the situation worse
but the bot seems to not post any new message (like the message with the join/leave button), and when I activated the join by voice channel, it did send me an MP, but with an error message
Okay so might be overloaded or something
is it possible to increase the timer for Ready-up from 5min?
Pretty sure it is attached to lobby timers
`/lobbychannel timer`
so you mean 2 votes for a win ?
for the map votes
oh sorry
<@460432631117643786>
-d /requiredvotes winner
its that one actually
aaaah perfect thanks and with that 2 teams can vote for maps not only one right?
that controls the number of votes for the winner of the actual match
there isnt any special control for just map votes
it would use whatever the
-d requiredvotes default
Hi <@145305657237700608> ! Schedule time command can be weekly, monthly or only dayly actually ?
Do you need NeatZ especially, if not just post the question, maybe someone else could help you out too üôÇ
currently its every day :/ i didnt implement it with per-day in mind which was dumb
Thanks for the answer anyway üòâ
Is their a way to pull my server stats for number of games played, # of players, to a csv file?
-d serverstats info
bad description, but that has player counts and game counts
is there a more detailed description on /mmr change variance ?
-d mmr change variance
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=mmr-change-variance has a calculator
I know this question's really vague, but leaderboard for one of my queues stopped working for whatever reason. /stats works fine, but leaderboard won't show anything for that specific queue.
Hi, remaches are infinite or limited at 1 for each player ? I didnt try yet
you can rematch over and over
And if a match is tied, is the streak value down to 0 for each player or it stays the same ?
streak is not modified for a tie
How does the /balanceby type mode:MMR work?
thats how it works by default
Balanced team selection will balance by MMR
yeah but in which range can players play with each other?
My highest rank is 5001 the lowest would start with 1000
depends on the queue type
if its PUGs, there is no max range
Its matchmaking rn
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=matchmaking
default range is 300
which is the initial range
Aaah okay thank you i see rn that i can change that. Thanks
Can't close a specific game even when i tried with /outcome selectwinner still didn't work and gave me the same message
I can close other queues but not a specific 1
<@145305657237700608>
Hi, how can i check the priority roles and their value for certain queue? in /info i see only spect roles.. but somehow i kick peeps with priority
Info should show everything, theres no really priority i guess, just diff perms
these are only roles different than everyone
or any way i can check perms?
You mean the roles of which thing, I see there u set some and those have their perms showing
Otherwise u set some different perms in the server settings
That wont be related to the bot
these are spectatoor roles
i guess i havent changed anything specific besides priority role (with value 0)
and the perm for using the certain commands
Or maybe other way, what perms or anything have an incluence on Priority in queue? As im joinning as a third person (to the role which has 2 slots) and iam kicking one person to +1
How i can start queue when its 6/10
/forcestart
whats the best way to test API response to see how i need to format and handle the responses?
e.g. i wanna pull current maps and gamemodes for a que, unsure how to stage a test environment for the calls except for only testing while a real que is active and underway
you can use /test to test queues
but yea, the API docs dont have any example responses
right on, i could add it to a test server so i dont test in the real server
thank ya
is it possible to pull map and gamemodes for a que?  looks like one of the many "get" commands should procure the info, but so far not finding a way to query this info
like what has been configured, not for a specific match?
yea for a specific match
which ever channel/serverid i specify, i'd suspect
tryin to reduce sophisitication, like if a single api call could grab the data, that would be sick, but if i need to pipe the response of one query into another query to 
get channelid
get maps for channelid
that would work too
thank you vm for your support
hmm i dont think there is a way to fetch that data for a specific match
there is the `/matches` endpoint, but it doesnt have that data
i can either add it there, or add an endpoint to fetch a specific match's data
when i start a q i have to type in the 5 letters right but when i end the Q it gives me 5 dif letters is their a way to keep it to one simple name or number
you shouldnt be ending the queue
but also, no
that would be stellar
wum if i start the q and edit it do i just leave it like that and not end q i just del the msgs]
and how do i make everyones elo public im going thru all the commands but cant find any related commands
Deletting the messages doesnt do anything
You dont need to end the queue
I explained to you before
Is there a way I can make it where people are not automatically kicked out after a certain amount of time when they select a team?
From the lobbychannel ?
oh no its not that.
one challenge im facing, is when neatque decides on the maps/modes for a series, we'd like to follow the standards for the game where a bo5 is always in this order [objective] - [slayer] - [objective] - [objective] - [slayer].. is there any way to define these sorts of requirements/limits to the quebot?
Kicked out of the queue?
Am i tripping or do i get more commands from my phone than on my laptop??
Yea as in when a team is selected like 13mins later or so it kicks the person out of queue due to inactivity is there a way for me to make it where they can stay in queue?
you are tripping
Hi, I have a doubt. Can the time of the ready button be changed?
I mean when you are enough to start a game and you need to press the ready button, I need to increase the time since people are a bit slow to press the button, ty
You probably have the timer really low
`/timer afk`
Or `/timer queuereset`
You can increase the waiting time with `/lobbychannel timer`
i tried those 3 cmmand and nothing
What those 3 commands i just sent u one
And thats the one it should be
lobbychanel , timer afk and timerqueureset
I wasnt answering to you in the first one
You should just use the lobbychannel timer command
I used it, I set it to 60 seconds and in 5 seconds it banned me üò¶
Are u sure youre not in test mode
Yes, I was testing in trial mode, but is it different from normal?
I wanted to test myself how the queue was going
Test mode reduces timers
oki bro ty, my bad
To back go to normal run `/test`
alright thank you I'll try those out
/test does not work for me it says .this application did not respond
wait the queue time cant go past an hour?
Hello !
1) Is there a command to cancel timer ban if the player didn't press the Ready button ?
2) How many games can we do daily ?
3) It is possible to gift a role to the top 1 player in leaderboard after reseting stats monthly ? And can it be weekly ?
it can, you have to change the timer
1) /dodge autoban
2) 50 with the free tier
3) /autoroles topplayers, it won‚Äôt be weekly or monthly but in real-time
For the last one, i was wondering if it was possible to add an autoroles topplayers command but for the leaderboardconfig monthly command ? And maybe btw add a leaderboardconfig weekly command ?
you can just manually give out a role once a month
autoroles are meant to update immediately on any change
any ways to address the gametype requirement structure?
`/gamemode selection gamemode_choice:Ordered`
<@145305657237700608> i tried it but is there a way to make specific options random and others static!
our goal is to follow the basic logic below

Guides:
> Game 2 and Game 5 are always Slayer
> map setlist should never have a an option for players to choose a re-occurring game mode

Setlist potential:
> Game 1: [Strongholds, KOTH, Oddball or CTF] 
> Game 2: [Slayer] 
> Game 3: [Strongholds, KOTH, Oddball or CTF] 
> Game 4: [Strongholds, KOTH, Oddball or CTF] 
> Game 5: [Slayer]

Example of how choices affect presented options:
> If Game 1 is chosen to be CTF, options for Game 3 would be [Strongholds, KOTH, or Oddball]
> Then, if Game 3 is Strongholds, options for Game 4 would be [KOTH or Oddball]
> Meanwhile, our goal is to make it so Game 2 and Game 5 don't provide gamemode choices, since they're statically slayer and only allow map to be chosen.
currently not possible yea
i need to update it to be more dynamic
i can formalize these feature requests by submitting a request and logging this if that would help
i also have other feedback for api response json formatting, if you'd be receptive
sure
probably should be pretty easy for the gamemode updates i guess, currently you select 1 gamemode from the dropdown, can just swap to selecting any number + randomly picking them
do you guys also experience the bug with showig only ppls ids?
Thats just discord, nothing that you can change
How do I add a map image when voting?
-d map add
Anyone or anyway to make sure everyone in my discord server has an MMR?
I upgraded to premium last night bc only 1000/2200 individuals have mmr
to get them on the leaderboard? or give a rating in name?
Rating
Because they have to purposefully and individually queue right?
-d ratinginname queuenames
if you set the queuename through this command, every person in the server should get renamed
although now that im thinking about it, it might not apply to every existing member
ill have to modify it
but the issue currently is that it would register every member in the server as a player, using up a player slot
i am planning to modify the premium system, one such change would be that only players who have played a game would count as a slot
maybe make a specific way to a) turn that off/on and b) im sure i could take the player role away, even now?
i have a question: is lobby rooms (text-based) are substituted with voice rooms in an update?
or does that thing still exists?
new text channels per match are supported yes
i got a little bit confused because in the documentation it only says voice lobbies are created
where does it say that?
basically everything about the bot is configurable
over 300 commands
i assume moving players to lobbies means this function contains voice channels only
because in text channels there is no user-placement, they just get a permission to a temporary channel
correct, the lobby channel command is referencing a voice channel
where players go before teams are made
text channels would be
-d tempchannels toggle
oh okay, thank you - maybe it did run under a different name last time because this seems like a new separate command, sorry
yea many commands have been renamed over time
<@145305657237700608> are there any specific examples of the bot you like people to see the ultimate level of the bot?
like the best versions / use of it
uhhhhh not really
i mean there are so many features its impossible to use them all
i dont even use the bot myself lmao, if i ran a server im sure the config would go crazy though
damn
Im asking bc seeing it would make it easier to know what could be done
Im at a great point but idk what else i can do
try out the latest update
with paying to join queues
win and get the prize
also was wondering if there are certain users in here that have made it profitable and how
i just need guidance bc im running off my guesses and others guesses
and WTH
HOW?
i would also be interested to know if anyone is able to profit off of it
im not sure

Hi guys, when the queue is canceled due to one player missing in voice channel, when the players go back tu queue, the ppl who were waiting foe second match are cleared
they should be temporarily cleared since the players requeued get priority, but they should get put back in
i believe theyre not, but ill look into that and make sure about it üòõ
Is there a way to make a cancel button for them Neatz? Available while waiting?
In the voice channel lobby
hmm not currently
they have to use the command
an automatic cancel button could be cool, i worry people would immediately hit it everytime though
Neatz probably not as often as youd think but I'd say make it configurable
And require votes like before
Sometimes i have guys waiting 4-7 min for one dude bc he went afk and forgot and even if i tell them all the time that they can / cancel they NEVER remember
Also the paying is in points haha i thought it was money üòÇ
yup built in points
but you can make points worth real money
if you remove the automatic points per match, and make them be purchased for example
using discord shop
*this might be against TOS, im not quite sure
What do the points do? So we have MMR atm and would points add anything to it? Specifically if it isn't worth money?
currently only used for predictions and are shown in /stats
can be attached to autoroles
might be cool if i made a sort of item-shop using points
Is there a reason my queue wont move to the bottom of the message
Leaderboard is under it but the queue wont move to the bottom
<@145305657237700608>
good evening sir, how do i unlink a leaderboard from certain channels, and how do I form new leaderboards
for different queues?

it depends on how your queues are linked currently
you will have to decouple them
<@145305657237700608> hey is there ranks role for certain ELO?
-d autoroles mmr set
Tysm
Also can I make Voice Queues and not text channels queues
It's like when 10 player join a Queue the game starts and players pick their teams, using game id. They can submit their score and staff adds ELO depending on the Screenshot of the final score.
if you dont have a new text channel per match, it would get very very messy
Alright, when players finish off their game, how can they submit their score so staff can add or remove their ELO
Im actually setting up a "Matchmaking category", is there separated documentation for that on the website?
players vote for the winner themselves, requiring no staff intervention
at least by default
why does the bot give unequal MMR to winners upon testing
Shouldn't it give a constant value (ex: 50) for winners and losers lose a specific amount
not by default, you can if you want
it depends on a few factors, its not random at all though
pretty much every game gives rating per player
not a flat rate
what factors
Opponent's mmr
And mmr variance
And if theres a multiplier aswell
noted
hello friends. I need a little help here. I'm trying to use "/queuename" and it will only let me change it to "player_stats"?
You can change your queue name to whatever u want to, the things that pop up are just other queues
is that the correct command? it certainly wont let me name it anything except "player_stats" for some reason
yea just type whatever u want
ok, when i type in the name i want
well it did work that time. your bot's out here making me look ignorant. lol
thanks
If u type and works = good, if u type and error = no good
I have 2 different queues and when I change a player's mmr they both change at the same time. How can I fix this?

i disabled /leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide but still same
if you do /info and check page 3, you can see where the queue is saving stats to
Everything looks as it should for me, but when I manually change the MMR of one player, the other queue also changes.
the queues show different shared stats?
the leaderboard shows different stats as i want
But there are roles that players earn according to their MMR points and these are different for 2 separate queues.
like this
and i want to change a player mmr for only 1 queue for example he should be plat for [1v1]
not 4v4
ok i solved it somehow
dostƒ±m √ß√∂zdƒün sanƒ±rƒ±m √ß√∂zemediysen
leaderboard share
hallettƒ±m kanka
Keep chat in english please
no mames
We actually have NeatQueue to create ten mans, as well as trying to get FaceIt Hub going too.
I really need help figuring out why my leaderboard never loads
even though /stats works
I don't want to nuke the queue just to make leaderboard work again
what does it look like
it‚Äôs just blank as if there‚Äôs no stats even on the website
whats the channel ID
1156274733210415185
could u invite me
done
its cuz you had `/mmr change hidden` enabled
thinking about it now, im not sure why i made it hide the leaderboard
I thought I tried troubleshooting by setting that false
let me try it rn while we have active queue
when i do /simulate for one game it's giving the winner 200 mmr instead of 20 which is what i selected? im new w this sorry if this is smth super easy to fix
Did u specify the players?
yeah it was the amount for 1 queue
idk if thats what im supposed to put
how many games did you simulate
it shows in the image
yea that is strange then
Hey, we had a person vote for the server but the /leaderboard command still continues responding that we need a person to vote to unlock the leaderboards.
<#919709100114346076>
is there a way to add MMR to multiple specific people at once?
-d add mmr
how can i support?
does anyone know how to put the match results in another channel?
`/resultschannel`
how can i reset queue numbers ? Like we want to start fresh season but games are still looking with 4 digit numbers ex: #3062
Is there a way to have roles be random after a queue is filled? I know I can set this up where people have to pick a role in advance, but we want to set up a random one where it will automatically choose your role after the teams are randomly made.
`/managestats reset all queue_name:`
its not actually possible to reset queue numbers
they are used internally for uniquly identifying each game
no not currently
<@145305657237700608> In this game (https://www.neatqueue.com/transcript/266243131853373440/1646) players didn't see the voting buttons after the end for some reason and were unable to continue playing next ranking games (because they could not vote). Could you maybe check this? Looks like a bug.
Ah i didnt see numbers thing i thought he was referring to mmr üòî
The winner message didnt even pop up to vote?
did u have to manually resolve the winner
Yes, one of the admins did
It looks so from what players reported and from the transcript
Here I have another problem. This transcript was working fine, but it is not visible anymore (https://www.neatqueue.com/transcript/266243131853373440/1091).
how old is it
15 days
yea they arent saved that long
14 days is the limit?
Hi, is the bot bugged or did I mess up some setting? It doesnt delete old queue messages, never happened before.
think its 7 days
Is there a way to increase this? Maybe for premium users. It is certainly too short for my needs and the way we handle tickets. I sometimes need to wait for other admin to translate the transcript etc. 14 days would work.
hmm, yea i think i can increase it quite a bit
Thank you
As a thank you gift, another report of a potential bug:
This players said that he was somehow added to 2 queues at the same time. 

His explanation: "at the 3rd minute of the first match, i received a notification for the second match and something like this happened.
after this happened, i explained to the people in the lobby and we canceled the second match."
i made it 3 months, that should be good
as for the bug, that is strange
I want to set the lowest MMR score at 800. What is the way to do this?
-d mmr minimum
is it effect all queues if serverwide option open
Configs are unique for the specific queue
still happening?
yea üò¶
idk this is so annoying people reshuffling maps forever
and there is nothing to prevent that
turn it off
-d map reshuffle
i don't wanna turn it off its very useful but it would be nice if we can limit this
a limit could be cool
is it possible to add it soon from you?
Hello guys any possibility to add ppls roles when were picking captains?
could you explain more
this week sure
I mean when we are voting for who should be captain
And the ppl roles (the ones when they enter the queue)could be seen near their nickname
Also is it possible to assign the role which prevents from being chosen as captain for (f.e.) 5 games and then the role is removed?
they should already be shown, no?
not currently
Its captain voting so theyre not visible
ah voting for captain
sure ill add it there
Thank you!!!!!!!!!
if i want to restart the mmr and score, not just one queue but the whole thing. what command could i do it with? I tried several and nothing
Wdym score
You reset stats with `/managestats reset all`
Did you not forget?
i took a look, would need some more help on what data i would care about
can someone help how i remove the dm the bot sends out
when a queue pops i dont want us to get pinged in the server and in dms
-d matchstart dmplayers
thank you and how do i force it to be captains mode always?
i do the setup and everything
sorry for being a noob w this
-d teamselection set
i choose captains on teamselect set and disabled the dmplayers
but when i start the queue
it still takes me to the voting process
when you end queue, you lose all the config
make a queue, and leave it
i see
i actually got it finally wow
and to change the queue size
nvm got it
Hey! Is there anyway for a higher up role to be able to see the private threads that get created by NeatQueue for match setup or do i need to make the tempchannels to actual text channels for this to be a thing?
i would preferably like to keep them as threads, but would like to be able to see the threads when they are opened - currently the threads are only visible to the 6 people that have queued
Change perms for that role via server settings
is there a way to make it so there cant be a draw?
ties are disabled by default
-d ties
Is there a way to allow a player in a set queue to join the opposing team's Voice Channel?  Or is that a feature only available for discord admins?
Yes ty , the command works for me for the queue. But I'm looking to delete stats all the time üò¶
someone knows?
that‚Äôs the command to delete stats
Yes, but it doesn't erase the all-time statistics, only deletes the ones in the current queue
i have a couple autorole mmr set up but people dont change roles going up but they do going down
that is not true
-d managestats reset all
queue name is optional
I guess my question was too dumb to answer...
You can change the channel restrictions, or just let everyone join any voice channel via server settings
Gotcha.  Thank you
i have a couple autorole mmr set up but people dont change roles going up but they do going down
How did u set up
/autoroles mmr set role:
Yes but the ratings
tyty i realized im just not discord literate and was able to see it the whole time just had to press on threads haha
how do i make one queue have different stats + lb from the other

im so confused üò≠
can someonme explain this to me
more basic
is it possible to have a first place, second place, third place?
Not a thing
<@145305657237700608>
How do we disable Q's in like the Queue channels
Like for example
Queue#454
How can you customize the 1v1 leaderboard blue text to your own message
wdym
the title?
is there a way to make it so a role can see and talk in the text channel so they can ref
-d spectatorrole add
My queues aren‚Äôt sticking to the bottom of my channels
I have the /message queuemessage sticky toggle set to true
when only one person joins the vc both of them get a queue ban is there a way to turn it off?
Is there a way to vote for a game mode after players join the queue? If so, how can I add the different game modes to the list?
Ideally Gamemode vote -> map vote
-d map add
will do a gamemode vote then map vote
sort of a bug which happens occasionally :/
how do you change who has permission to edit the results
<@145305657237700608> a discord I used neatqueue in was nuked, any chance you have backups of the database so we dont have to start over
the discord was pretty popular and hit leaderboard for daily stats in <#935731235790139422> fairly often
would be cool if you could
sure i can restore it to a new server
id of 1224801652003967008
can you do it
its not a "new" server
its the same server that ws nuked but idk why thaatd be a hinnderince
hi is there a way to remove like the voting of captains when i choose random as like the preset? example it says are MXKX & LALALA ok as captains and we vote yes or no. ( i would rather it just picks 2 and there is no say in it )
`/captains reshuffle`
if its the same server, what am i doing exactly
basically
the person deleted the queue somehow
like when they nuked
because when we ran /leaderboard after the nuke
it says no queue found
you should be able to use
-d config list
and then just find the most recent config and use `/config load`
it just says "config" with an empty embed <@145305657237700608>
<#1230292348274217041>
is that channel gone
nope
i think the list is empty cuz we never saved the config
if the channel is still there, the queue isnt gone
just use `/clearqueue`
it is
cuz i remade it
all the channels got deleted
i remade it
does this channel exist
yes but its bcuz i remade it
the queue is gone now
you ended the queue
no bro
i remade a temproary one
but i deleted it cuz u said u could bring the old old one back
gotcha
apparently deleting the channel won't save a config code, so itll be a bit harder to grab, need some time
aight
how long
not long
how long ago was it nuked
so i know what day to look at the queue in the backups
today
queue name was "Season 1 Ranked Draft" ?
correctamundo
use `/config load RBMRH`
worked like a charm
thanks brother
Past two matches we had to reconnect to the VC because the bot didn‚Äôt auto move people over from lobby channel for some reason? Is it broken?
<@145305657237700608>

thanks
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> are the lobby channel pull actions fixed?
its sorta just a bug that randomly happens
so probably
hi is there a way to make 2 teams winner in captains mode?
cuz the finals have a weird system where top 2 quals
Nope
damn aight
Hi <@145305657237700608> something seems weird about my leaderboard. It displays nothing anymore after a managereset stats. I've already voted for the bot. I've linked it to the actual queue too. Any ideas ?
Also when i click on the button show my stats, it displays correctly my stats
Maybe a bug ?
if you reset stats, there is nothing to show
yeah but after reset i've played some games but the leaderbord still displaying nothing
mb i didn't precised it lol
on my stats i can see that i'm in second place actually
even on site there is nothing on the leaderboard lol
did you enable hiding mmr?
yea, for some reason i made that hide the leaderboard
ill probably change that
it doesnt make much sense
but why this command hide the other stats too ?
because all stats are hidden on the leaderboard with this command
not only mmr
wdym
games, wins, losses, points, mmr, winrate, peak mmr
i confirm mmr change hidden command hide all stats on leaderbord, not only mmr
good point
I am having an issue where I can't view my leaderboard, it just tells me I need to vote top.gg, so I do, and then re run the command and it just says I still need to vote
<#919709100114346076>
hi again, now leaderboard doesn't display anything again and "Points" on leaderbord disappeared
and on website its ok btw
Sorry just saw this! Where do I say it? In my server or this one?
in yours
Awesome thank you sm!
<@145305657237700608> my leaderboards still dont populate ccording to theri queueu
theyre blank
Did u enable hidden mmr by any chance
<@648635725964902411> I'll check then change it if need be
Same here
And i‚Äôve disabled hidden mmr
But my leaderboard still blank
plz share links
wdym by links ?
config load ?
it seems to be good now weird.. Maybe because i've putted the /leaderboardconfig monthly toggle on true + reset instead of rolling. I think that reseted all stats immediatly. But yesterday night i'm sure that was not displaying nothing even after doing some games.. The reset doesn't works like at first of each month ?
and it is normal to not have the possibility to show Points on leaderbord anymore ?
when you enable monthly it starts tracking as if its a new month
since by default, stats arent per-month
if you are looking at a monthly leaderboard it wont show points
since points arent monthly
Ok mb ! Ty
Is there a way I can make a duplicate of the same queue but have it just go to another leaderboard within the same server?
disable queue bans?
`/dodge autoban` 0
Hey, random question, you may or may not be able to help, I have an API I use to pull a URI protocol used for a game, and return this in the HTTP Get call, is there any sort of capability for NeatQueue to recieve the URI, or possibly include the URI in one of the QUEUE messages it sends? Or is there something in the API where I could have a program send a message through the neatqueue bot whenever a new match is created? I'm not sure if I'm articulating my question well or not
i think i understand, but no you cant send messages through the bot specifically
you can set up a webhook which listens for when a match starts, and send your message then
from your own bot/webhook
i took a look, would need some more help on what data i would care about
