<@145305657237700608> my leaderboards still dont populate ccording to theri queueu
theyre blank
Did u enable hidden mmr by any chance
<@648635725964902411> I'll check then change it if need be
Same here
And i‚Äôve disabled hidden mmr
But my leaderboard still blank
plz share links
wdym by links ?
config load ?
it seems to be good now weird.. Maybe because i've putted the /leaderboardconfig monthly toggle on true + reset instead of rolling. I think that reseted all stats immediatly. But yesterday night i'm sure that was not displaying nothing even after doing some games.. The reset doesn't works like at first of each month ?
and it is normal to not have the possibility to show Points on leaderbord anymore ?
when you enable monthly it starts tracking as if its a new month
since by default, stats arent per-month
if you are looking at a monthly leaderboard it wont show points
since points arent monthly
Ok mb ! Ty
Is there a way I can make a duplicate of the same queue but have it just go to another leaderboard within the same server?
disable queue bans?

Hey, random question, you may or may not be able to help, I have an API I use to pull a URI protocol used for a game, and return this in the HTTP Get call, is there any sort of capability for NeatQueue to recieve the URI, or possibly include the URI in one of the QUEUE messages it sends? Or is there something in the API where I could have a program send a message through the neatqueue bot whenever a new match is created? I'm not sure if I'm articulating my question well or not
i think i understand, but no you cant send messages through the bot specifically
you can set up a webhook which listens for when a match starts, and send your message then
from your own bot/webhook
Hey guys i wanted to as a few things. 

I am hosting a Fifa tournament on discord
Can the bot start the game with out players joining the VC channel ( preferably it doesn't show up at all)?
Can the bot do its own bracket system ( Tournament mode maybe single elim mode)?
Can i add multiple players to the queue with out them doing it?
Can i see the bracket as a image or on the website?
Is there a way to cancel the queue channel (thread) from autoclosing if there is a dispute ?
This would help out a lot.
Yes to all as far as I know.
1. Yes you can disable VC channels.
2. Bracket Mode is supported with the Website Challonge.
3. You can add people to the queue with a Command ( idk it currently, but its easy to check in the documentation)
4. Bracket images can be provided by Challonge Website which can be connected to the bot. üòâ
wdym?
I set queue channels to autoclose after 40 minutes.
but would be great to stop that timer in case of any discussions / disputes.
just for a single thread / channel
nah you would have to disable it
cant pause it per match
Is there a possibility to maybe add that <a:thinkRoll:585724848823599105>  ‚ù§Ô∏è *please*
somewhere is the mvp of the game?
can i make mmr in names work for two queues at once
like
[500] userrname [1000]
<@145305657237700608>
Why does it say unknown-user?
for some pple when they join
can i enable mmr names for only 1 q?
you can do this if you use
-d ratinginname queuenames
and if the format contains two $s
except you can‚Äôt do both a prefix and suffix
Oh thats interesting
is there a way to search for games that 2 specific players were together in <#915813502558556181>
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>
Not really
I mean, i guess you can with the already discord search in a channel option, but trough the bot i dont think so
yeah ive tried that but i don't find anything
even if i don't use mentions: and just type the user i still find nothing
Person is saying this <@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608>
anyone know how to fix
How many games u get, discord rate limit the creation of channels to the bot
How do i make the bot priortise who joined the queue first rather than mmr? ( chose pubs setting )
our highest elo player for example keeps getting skipped if i dont force start it at 6 people
Whats ur config
whats the fix?
how do i check?
please i got like 20 people trying to play and they spam dming lmao
<:sadcat:1179569615911800842>
all my queues share the same mmr leaderboard except the 3 new ones (vip) i just made. why is this
i want them all to share
and also is there a way to remove a single players stats
Theres no fix at all, do /serverstats info and tell me how many games appear
/config
qtyp1
okay but why when there is 10 people in queue it doesnt make channels
what does server stats have anything to do with that
Everything, discord rate limit the creation of channels if you pass some number in x time, not sure what it is, but as i can see is not your case, only 40 daily games shouldnt be a problem, neatZ could investigate further of whats the cause
any luck on the solution?
damn alr
youll have to investigate more
thats not enough info really for me to do anything
this is discord updating - this used to be the persons discord id (123453245234523), now it just says unknown users instead
good to know, thx
i dont know if that is better or worse tbh
when we tried to cancel games in temp queue channels it says no match found but there is already
is it possible to make the leaderboard the same for a private queue as a public one <@145305657237700608>

help
did  the match actually start?
or did it give an error at some point
its saying there is no match to cancel
<@145305657237700608> remember when u backed up our server cuz it got nuked
well now when a new player tries to queue iot doesnnt work
only ppl who were in the dtabase before nuke can
what happens
theyre unnable to join queue
yea but what happens
why cant they
im guessing because of the database reboot or wtv
it just saays iunteraction failed
only thing i did was give you a queue config
nothing with stats
can you force a vote if people arent voting
force a winner
-d outcome selectwinner
-d map reshuffle
when will the map reshuffle limit feature be added
everyone is really looking forward to it
i have that enabled but it doesnt share for my vip queue
<@145305657237700608>
if you do /info and goto the MMR page, it says the stats system being used in the top left
which you can compare between the queues
<@145305657237700608>
How can i make it so that mmr doesnt go into negatives
-d mmr minimum
also
<@145305657237700608> How do I make it so that mmr displays on name
like a server im in
Has like
NameExample - (100)
To display MMR in your name, you can use the command `/ratinginname toggle` to enable showing player MMR in your nickname. Additionally, you can set the format for ratings in nicknames using the command `Show MMR in Name`.
how can i do that?
close enough
<@145305657237700608> final question sorry
how can i reset EVERYTHING
like every players wins
losse
loses
and everything
when i used reset cmd i think it only effected mmr
-d managestats reset all
tysm
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to be able to customize my temporary channels when setting up queues to make it so specific roles can talk etc
<@857633321064595466> the bot is acting up right now.  Not moving players, kicking them from voice channels
<@145305657237700608> Hi brother, I have a question, is there any way to increase the number of people who can enter the voice channels created by the bot? I need to add that (not manually) so that viewers can enter.
you can either give out a spectator role, or remove channel restrictions
Is that viewer role you say a role that can be granted with the bot or is it literal to create a discord role and give it the necessary permissions?
Sorry if it's a stupid question, I'm starting to really get into the bot and there are some things I don't completely know.
its discord role but through the bot
spectators can join any team vc
-d spectatorrole add
I didn't know that existed, thank you very much.
ill do it later today
I have another question, why can't players type /cancel and the other question is, why can't they type /leaderboard or /stats, sorry for the inconvenience
Wdym they cant type?
You prob have disabled the use of commands for them
I mean when they are playing and want to cancel the game, they can't do it because they don't "have permissions", but as an admin it doesn't let me either because it says I'm not part of the queue.
what would that command be?
As you being admin you should use `/outcome cancel`, its to force the cancel
Thats just discord settings, not related to the bot
If I activate the option to "use application commands" other "admin" options are activated that I do not want them to have, such as resetting the auto roles given by the bot, etc.
okey
they both say the exact same
idk why all others worked but as soon as i add a role requirment it doesnt
and can someone send a video of how the tournaments work
wdym?, you need to have them activated otherwise all the commands wont be available, you can limit wich commands they use
altough the important commands are admin use only
is that to give you a little context, I want the players to be able to write /leaderboard or /stats in the specific channel, but I have to enable the option that I told you so they can do it, but if I do it I get options that I don't want let them come out
what options?
as i said before you can limit that
example
How can you limit or choose which ones you can place and which ones you can't?
thats admin only
and sorry if I ask something obvious or stupid
Admin only, meaning no one can unless they are admins, and to limit you do it via server integrations
ooooo thank you very much
hello
i would appreciate help setting up the bot
i get this notification all the time and i tried everything to fix it but its not working

<@145305657237700608>
does one have monthly stats enabled?
both off
i did a test the leaderboard was the same until i added the role requirements
idk why <@145305657237700608> you
if you have a role requirement, only people with that role show up on the leaderboard
i want to make it so people who pay $2 get to play in the vip queue for double mmr on a win. Wiill it still update for the normal leaderboard?
but the leaderboard obeys the role requirement
they will show on the main leaderboard though
are you able to kick someone from a queue without just banning them?
-d player remove
wow that shouldve been easy

<@145305657237700608> Unable to create channels due to Discord rate limit. Please try again later! 

The queue has been acting up all day and a few hours ago thew this one
whats ur server id?
932047989189541959
Hello! How can i disable the following menu when the match is found? My queue team size is 1, and there is only 2 teams, which dosent require such things to be voted, especially the MMR.
-d teamselection set
I already used this command, and didnt really change anything.
I make another test, but seems like it bugged out.
thats the command to customize that menu
Seems like the problem is solved by selecting the "unfair" option
However, by selecting "random" it dosent seem like it does anything for the first time
Thank you for the help, also i do want to ask something about the free planning which are mentioned in the <#910981294937210930> channel. Is the daily 25 game restriction comes per player or overall queue?
its a server restriction
Ouch. Any plan (Basic, Enterprise) elevating that restriction?
yes the basic one goes up to 150 per day
That is the maximum limit that can be reached via subscription?
no thats the next tier up
it says what each gives in <#910981294937210930>
maybe confusing, but those are the changes
ill update it to be more clear
<@145305657237700608> i ran all the cmds for setting up nicknames on ppl names but its not working
i ran like 8 queues today
and no one got their name changed wit the mmr
Its only a suggestion to think out something else regarding to the game restrictions.

By the way, I'm very sorry for this current situation, because it looks like it's became completely useless for many people unless they pay for the biggest package.
If, let's say, I have 50 players, then each person can play a maximum of 1 match per day with the system, which is already not worth it to anyone. 
If in this case there are 50 players again and there is a limit of 25, then approximately if 4-5 players out of 50 actively play 5-6 games in a row, which may take less than 10 minutes, the application will be unusable within half hour.
This only includes 1v1 servers, of course, although they also have the most potential user base.

As a temporary solution, I would perhaps put a limit of 15 matches per player on the one-man teams, because otherwise this cuts out a lot of possibilities already.
thats a fair assessment, i think the same issue applies to the current system which has a 50 game limit
maybe another type of calculation should be used
which addresses number of players and the number of matches
In addition, the limitation could perhaps be introduced in such a way that it could increase the popularity of the application. Obviously, if you can play 10-15 games a day on "ranked" then you can't wait for the 24 hours to pass that can form a good foundation for a competitive experience, and also pervent players from excessive addiction.
This is only a thought about how this could be improved, but i dont look behind the scenes that technically how effective this is in terms of the application resources.
thats also an important piece, hosting a 10v10 match vs a 1v1 is basically the exact same from the bot's pov
how do i make the timer till the voting menu works 5 minutes
thank you im waiting üôè
Is there a way to remove some of these queue names? They were made while trying to test stuff, and we really don't need most of them
they should disappear if you reset stats for those queue names
Thanks!
When creating a tournament, you have to join as a party. We don't really like that, as we want it to be a draft tournament.

However, when we have the queue set up to 6 teams of 11, it caps the queue off at 66. We also don't want that, because we want a player pool larger than 66.

So... Is there a way around either one of these issues? Either creating a tournament with a player pool instead of parties, or creating a queue with an uncapped size?
in the current state, tournaments cant automatically create teams, so people would need to register with their team
as for the cap, you can set it to whatever you want, it just wont automatically start
if you have a 200 team cap, then start it when it has 50 team, it will create a 50 team bracket
I appreciate it
how do i make the timer till the voting menu works 5 minutes <@145305657237700608>
and also is there a way for people in queues with afk others to get new teammates
which timer?
Ahhahahaha what are u Doing here
does the bot have perms to nickname people?
make sure it's role is higher than everyone elses
the timer from when everyone readys up and you can vote thehe winner
The*
<@145305657237700608> still happening btw
new p[pl cnt play
thats not a bug, that means there is not valid starting mmr for them
-d startingmmr set
i guess maybe since the config was reloaded manually it didn't copy the starting mmr setting
is there a way to extend the timer for a game to autocancel
but just for one game specifically
if someone needs like 10 minutes
como me uno :"v
join where
not really
a un sv de lan o como es esto, me perdi
i speak spanish, i can get what u mean but keep chat in english so its better lol, if u need an explanation you can dm me, but basically this is the support server for the neatqueue bot that is for creating customizable queues for your own server
<@145305657237700608>
Does monthly queues reset all stats (games, wins, loses, winrate....) or just MMR?
everything, but not points or MVPs
ai was almost right
<@145305657237700608> hello sorry to bother you but can you help me out with an issue
Is there a way to change the queue to prio whoever joined first rather than elo based?
keep having this issue where people get skipped
despite waiting 40min for a game
you can change the queue type to PUGs
so it auto starts when filled up
yea thats what i have rn
i did the default settings and all w pubs, choose to create temp seperate vcs
if it‚Äôs set to pugs it would just start a match when filled
well idk what to tell you but we keep having people getting skipped
we have 6 people ingame who just finished 4 in queue already waiting for new lobby
aand 3 of the people in queue got skipped for example just 5min ago
only thing i can think of is if the previous match cancelled cuz it didn‚Äôt get enough people ready
which would put them back in queue at the front
nope game was finished nornamlly and we voted for winnner etc
i remade the setup aswell just to double check
but same issue ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
i make sure its pubs w mmr
take a video if you can plz
will try to get a clip for you when it happends again
no way for u to like check out or config or something?
I could have setup it wrong but i have double checked honestly
sure do /config save
and ill try it
soloq2222
could you also take a look at why the bot has stopped auto move us to the team channel we get?
instead of just kicking us out and we have to manually join our team channel
I've asked the IA if you can reduce cd from stats check, but i would like to know if maybe buying the premium version of the bot reduces the cooldown.
not currently
this is a matchmaking queue, not pugs
what
i have chosen pubs...
u sure its just not the name that was given to this queue?
yes, it has the matchmaking format
alright thanks.

how to automove ?
From where to where
from start q to pick room
hello guys, are there any plans for statistics commands? f.e. what are the days when the most games are played, which heros, maps are most freqently picked, what is the winratio, etc/
i believ these are easy to make
Start where? Voice channel where u join queue? The name called queue?
Yes i think
just start room
The channel called queue you have to manually join, if u have a lobby channel, people can be moved from and to that channel every game
I think you could implement the hero and maps with the new survey command
Yes, but it isnt move automatic
Wdym? It is, you join the lobby channel then u will be moved from there to the queue channel, where you pick
Yes, but it isnt automatic
What do you mean by automatic
it isnt moving me
From where to where
my english is so bad sorry
lobby to pick room
Did u join the lobby channel, and set the lobby channel for the queue you queued?
It wont work if u join any other queue
Isnt global
It is working now thx
i just didnt do that lobby channel
<:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
Is there a way to make a certain map played more than it is atm? I have the setup where players choose the modes but not the maps. There is one map+game mode that is RARE to get and it so happens people love that map and mode. Is there a wasy to make that specific map and mode more prevalent? I have tried adding it multiple times to the map list but it does not help.
Theres an option in `/map selection` that is least frequent, altough this is a still method, so it probably doesnt fit at all, since the map probably would get played too many times cause of that
You mean something that can vary?
Right, i feel like the bot never chooses that map haha
Well anyway im not using heroes and maps within my discord <:pepeOk:1179576926613020772> ü§£
Others things could be implemented via the API, but if youre not familiar with coding i guess thats not on your plans
Well Im learning but ive got very skilled teachers.. üôÇ
Ill take a Look on that
is there a way to display my servers leaderboard for everyone in it to see permanently? just started using the bot yesterday
Just do /leaderboard
It wont get deleted
it just tells me there isn‚Äôt an active queue
Go to the channel where u want the lb, do `/link` then refer to the queue channel
Could someone make a server with the bot and specific settings? I pay
You have a basic guide in channel's topic, if youre struggling youre free to ask whatever u want here about the bot
How do I set it to always generate queues?
because every time I do a /setup and test the queue, it disappears and stops generating
The queue is only onetime setup, it will serve as join point to generate games, you do not need to end the queue everytime a game is done or reset it, it will start when the teamsize is reached
Wdym by that? The queue message dissapears?
If you can help me, I would be grateful as I don't speak this language.
yeah
Hmm thats weird
It should show the queue message, dont see any problem
or if you could give me a config where there are 2 teams with 8 players, which the captains with the highest mmr choose in 1-1-1-1 with an average mmr of 25, starting with 500, I would really appreciate it
Or if you want I can put you on the server to help

How do I change the channel that's shown at the bottom
Just use need again
I need to change it
There's another channel
I want to set it to a new one
Use the command u used, again...
You don't get it
When I use the command it shows that channel
/need
But I wanna change the channel shown
So when I type `/need` it shows the channel I changed
Bro, just put the channel u want to show in the need parameter
I don't want to do that
Queue-archived is an old channel
No one can see it
I want to put a new channel
I dont get what u trynna achieve tbh
Ok so
When you type `/need`
It shows #queue-archived
I want to change that
Theres the need command, if theres no args, it will show the channel that your queue is, if u put the paramater you can see the channels, select one and it will change it
Wait
What's the command name
`/need`

how does the bot know its linked to the challonge tournament
im really confused on how the tournaments work
ive read everything on the website with commands
and im still confused
you have to use `/tournament create`
How long dose it take for thread tempchannal to delete it self?
it should be deleted after the match
Ahhh it was my bad <:KEKW:913224623074730015> bot didnt have perm to manage threads
that explains a lot <:sadcat:1179569615911800842>
üëÄ i dont think that perm is requested by default
probably should add it
that can be a good thing
nah im gonna add it
if people want to use threads it shouldnt requiring messing with perms
<a:BE_Nod:662221368833605652>
how will the bot know it the tournament is linked to challonge
im really confused
it will create the tournament
you dont have to do anything on the challonge website
how does the bracket work then?
how do i connect it to challonge for users to sign up?
you dont, people join the tournament in discord
by joining the tournament queue
when the queue fills, it starts the tournament and creates the matches
oh wow thats cool
if its a 3v3 tournament but someone has to go half way through the tournament can they get others on there team?
will it be the party that has to be the same
or the players
each party is the same players
if someone leaves the party can you get a new person
to replace them?
in tournaments not currently
<@145305657237700608>  
because when configuring a queue, it interferes with another that was already configured ?
Can u be more specific
<@145305657237700608> when i create and join a tournament it makes my opponent play no one
how many people joined?
me a mod and two others
only 1 game was created
and theu all were 1 player in the queue
but only 1 let them vote
team size was 1
can you link me the bracket
i do see errors
all i did was /tournament create
if you click the queue message title it should link to challonge
i ended the tournament is there a way to get it back
nvm i found it
ok i do see somehow a team was empty
https://challonge.com/Yeeps_Competitive_Server_Tournament_516968c03a994e38baaebcb3aeb84525
bracket is fine though
ill look into it
and it made 2 matches with 1 team matches
k thanks
found the issue, will be updating shortly
give it a shot
i will soon
when someone first queues with "x" role and say it gives them a "30" rating with said role. IF i gave them another role a week later that if they had first queued with that it would have given them a"40" rating would that supercede or override the original starting mmr? Im guessing no but i would much more like to make sure
nope it won't overwrite
since they would already have a starting MMR
That doesnt really make sense
Also keep chat in english as said <:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
I said this bc, you must be enabled something or youre doing some config in wrong channel or idk, but configs are per queue, so it doesnt really make sense
<@145305657237700608> is the bot down
its not dragging
is it slow sometimes?
we paid 20 bucks and it doesnt work
no it‚Äôs not down
seems like it‚Äôs missing dragging sometimes though
should be good now
is there any command that let bot say whatever I want once the queue start?
like queue stared and ppl in the waiting vc
and I wanna make bot say something to indicate the players
any command? <@145305657237700608>
I dont think theres a command for that
Maybe a way to go around that is enabling the match start dm players, and with the /language override, change the dm message
Another way is doing a custom webhook that will run when a game is created
whoa
alright
ty <@648635725964902411>
Theres something maybe like that, like /lobbydetails, but those will just execute when teams are created
yea lobby details or language override would be the easy ways
language overrides let you customize anything the bot says
in a tournament is there a way to make the match cancel if both teams are disqualified
so then the team who would play the winner would automatically go to the next round
it cant have both DQ, someone needs to advance
Hey <@145305657237700608> I'm having an issue with the voice chat in one of the servers I work with. We cannot get a limit on the voice channel & it's creating problems with players joining the other teams
What commands have u ran
restricted channels, no spectator, can't find anything else that seems to fit
do you have a staff role?
Eirher that or you changed category perms or someone
im admin from same server...if I view as one of the base roles, it shows I can join the queue...but in another server I have set it up in previously it shows created vcs as a locked channel and only people in queue can join...as well as showing 4/4 allowed
<:majwhatda:1209555777564581961>
I've checked category perms as well as role perms and its the same as it would be anywhere else
the lock depends on if you have spectator roles, staff roles, or channel restrictions disabled
theres no spectator roles, theres 2 staff roles that only a few have and channel restrictions are enabled
I think the staff role is the cause
Prob
<:majwhatda:1209555777564581961>
so if i take off le staff roles itll fix?
although it shouldn‚Äôt be breaking anything
the channel limit is gone, but the permissions still apply
the channel limit is removed to let staff join
oki, we just need it so that no one from outside of the queue can join and haven't been able to figure it out to save our lives
As long as our actual staff can join like the casters, it should be fine to remove the staff role <@924457308656922675>
that would have to be something with your permissions
the team voice channels created deny everyone joining, but explicitly allow the team to join
Thank you thank you thank you <:PeepoHeart:1171269076971180042>
excuse me, i can get 4 queue in the same server?
different queue channels? or 4 matches at the same time
different queue
you can have 3 different queue channels for free
you need premium for more
where buy the premiun and what is the price?
<@857633321064595466> premium
> ### How to get premium
> 1) Login at https://www.neatqueue.com
> 2) Click the Dashboard tab
> 3) Select your server
> 4) Purchase credits and/or select a plan
re: this, I didn't see a response but wanted to know if that was already the case? wanting to set up a "ban 4 maps, play leftover/select 3 maps" queue
you can set up map bans with
-d map bans
if there is 1 map left after bans it is automatically picked
yeah I get the map bans part, I was more hoping that I could set the channel to a /bestof 3, have them ban 4 maps, and them pick the last 3 in order so I could get it to log
but the map bans are good enough
i‚Äôm not quite sure i‚Äôm following
so you have a best of 3 with 7 maps, the players ban 4 maps, then they pick the order of the last 3 maps?
the same idea would be applied to a bo5 for example, ban 2, select 5
this is the case already with a bo1 obviously, just how it naturally works as you stated above:

ban 6, auto selects last map
that should work out fine then
Does the best of setup make them pick maps? I have never used it
-d bestof
sort of unrelated to best of, but yes by default if you have multiple maps it will open a vote
-d map selection
Rather, so if I had map1, map2, map3 left after map bans and it was a best of 3, they would pick map3 for example, and the next team would pick from map1 and map2?
Great, the functionality is as needed already blessed
I think the only thing I would ask is for map bans, is it currently set to swap between each team per ban, if set to per_team? So ban 1, ban 1, ban 1, etc
yes once per team
Great, thanks for the help
is there no way to force pick captains?
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to make it so a certain role gets double mmr on a win in any queue?
and also is there a way to ban people from giving free mmr
they did it 50+ times
-d teamselection
We have the enterprise plan, but we're being told we don't have it.
I just realized the issue. Is there a way to make it automatically extend?
Nope
i do keep meaning to add an auto extend option
You could set an anticheat streak
could you do a 2 day tournament
Right now our server is concerned that we will be unable to use NeatQueue for a tournament for all teams in a timely fashion. Since we are running all matches at the same time, if we required all teams to use a tournament-queue for example in this tournament coming up next Friday, it would have to pop 10 times in order to form the lobbies for just the first round of Swiss. Every round of Swiss, we would need that to happen as well in a fast fashion to stay on schedule. 

We've previously had issues with nq handling making vcs, but usually that coincides with the bot being down. I'm wondering if there is a better solution like making multiple queues [?], or something of the sort. 

Context we are on Enterprise if that makes a difference.
it should pop each match pretty quickly
what part of the timing worries you? is it the voice channels?
sure, you can disable new rounds starting automatically
so you can control when to kick off the next round of matches
how long can a tournament start for
wdym?
Worrying about rate limiting, server has 130k people and tons of interaction with a bunch of channels, so we're wondering if we should be concerned it being able to generate 10 vcs at the same time effectively
its hard to say, i would hope it is fine though
the bot has been used in servers where it needs many thousands of channels over the day and usually it is fine
will a tournament ever delete if it isnt played for a certain amount of time?
and also is there a way to make it so a certain role gets double mmr in all queues?
-d mmr multipliers set
great thanks
well, all the normal queue config exists, so individual matches will get cancelled sure
wdym
will the bot tell me when i need to pay premium again
will the command do it for all queues
Youll have to set it for each queue
it hasnt worked
i keep testing it but its giving me the same every time
it says that <@145305657237700608>
Wdym
i tested it with and without the role and it didnt give me the mmr
do you have static MMR enabled
how do i see
<@145305657237700608>
its not making 2 separate teams vc now my config: JJACD
in  /info on the MMR page
in the top right it shows the MMR change
looks like its because `/message winnermessage results value:` is disabled
although seems like a bug, it should still make the VCs
okay ill try enabling it and then retesting ill lyk if it works
sounds good, ill add a fix later though
tyy it worked
can u reply to my msg when u get it fixed?
oh also i configed the bot in my test server and i got it so that no one can type in the queue#__ text channel but i cant replicate it for my server 
it gives the people in queue perms and i dont want people in the server being able to type in the generated channels. (i already have @/everyone view channel and send messages off)
Is that the temp channel?
the temp text channel
the vcs are fine
i think
You need to change it in category perms instead, changing it in the generated channel wont do anything
i did
Text channels will inherit the category perms
im saying it individually gives the people in queue the perms
to text in chat
thats  correct
is there a way to remove that
you dont want to give players permissions to chat?
i did it in my test server but i cant replicate it
not in the temp chat
so nobody can chat?
i cant always moderate that channel
so its better if its off
in the voting and map picking channel
-d tempchannels permissions set
you should be able to customize it via this cmd
and do whatever perms you want
i did do this with @/everyone
but again it adds the members in queue individually and gives them perms
^ as u can see in this image mumushi3 has view and send msg perms
while @/everyone does not
and the category permissions are off for sending messages
already
Do they have any special role
disable
-d channel restrictions
and it will stop giving them explicit access
the bot will stop putting special perms on the new channels
except for those custom perms
looks fine
so i did that and now it works but they can now message in the vc- text chat
-d voicechannels permissions set
deny the send message perms
Hmm, is there a way to stuff 8 different lobbies into one queue, or do I have to make 8 copies of a single queue?
wdym "stuff" them into 1 queue
a single queue can make any number of matches
Well, it's more like:
I need to organize specific team v team matches, and if one team queues the lobby, then we need to wait for the other specific team to queue and form the match before any other team can start theirs
So my first thought was just to make "queue1", "queue2", .... "queue8" and tell those teams to join queue[#]
otherwise speed starts to be a concern, waiting for 16 teams to wait their turn to join a lobby in the correct order
yea different queues would be the easiest way
Gotcha, just wanted to know if it was a feature or not rather than the method I thought, ty
it doesnt seem to work
Hmm, looking up your tournament feature developed and that would seem to be a way to pre-make team v team setups with the ready up system, would need to look up more but it looks promising instead of making 8 queues
you probably could yea
if you can customize the matches on challonge it will pick up the changes
Actually, I wonder how to assign /party's to a premade bracket, still reading but I feel like i'm missing it
Or it's more I have to let NQ create the bracket, let parties join, and then edit the bracket afterwards
this
bracket is created after the tournament starts
you can disable automatic match creation, modify the bracket, then start the first round
I see, is the tournament integrated into the /party system, or is it on an individual? I see there's a "team_size", but also that "maximum_participants" mentions "parties"

For example, I have 5 parties to set up in a swiss style tournament

```/tournament create maximum_participants:5 tournament_type:swiss team_size:5 name:Test Tournament```
if the team size is 1 then people can join without needing to make a party
you must have a full team sized party to join the tournament
I see, I'm more confused on the maximum_participants then, so each captain would join to fill up each slot, with a team size of 5 in the command above?
that‚Äôs the total number of parties that can join
so for a 64 team bracket, the maximum_participants is 64
<@145305657237700608>  Unable to create channels due to Discord rate limit. Please try again later! any idea?
is  there a simpler way than parties for tournaments
Discord rate limits channel creation if it exceeds some number in x time
You can try to have the channels in threads mode, since these dont count as proper channels
ty bro
I'm not finding anything easily but is there a way to make sure stats show in only one designated channel? Server owner wants it used somewhere else to help keep the queue channel less cluttered
you can disable the application commands permission in other channels
And it won't affect players using the queue? I suggested this but we wanted to make sure
well it will disable using any commands
but usually players don‚Äôt need commands
<@145305657237700608> also touching back on the issue we had with VCs not locking to a specific number, we have staff members that can't see the channels created for queues along with the VCs. Is there any kind of fix to where we can just give them staff role in the bot without it messing with the vc limits?
do they have staff roles already?
Within the server itself, yes.
I had to take away staff via the bot because it was indeed causing issues.
so the staff role lets the bot know who needs extra perms
if you don‚Äôt want to use that you can manually set up the permissions with
-d tempchannels permissions set
-d voicechannels permissions set
Great, thank you. And I‚Äôd much rather be able to give the staff role via the bot but it just messes with the vc limits and we need that. CoD kids love to troll üò≠üò≠
the limits shouldn‚Äôt really matter
it‚Äôs more of the permissions
if you rely on just the limits and the perms are messed up, someone might leave the channel and someone steals their spot
Perms are set the way he wants them which is why we have to keep vcs locked (we have staff to dc people if they decide to be weird & join and take a spot in the vcs.)  But yeah, I'll try those commands
for some reason anyone can join the vcs now like the teams. i want the players to be able to join the teams, i want the teams locked to outside members, and i dont want the players to be able to speak in vcs.
oh! for map bans, how does it decide who bans first?
``per_team: (Required) If the map vote goes team by team. Team 1 picks first map, Team 2 picks next, ...`` makes me believe it just auto defaults to team1, and I'm wondering if there's a way to change that in a voting menu in lobby for example
yea it‚Äôs just team 1
There are a lot of players with low mmr falling for players with high mmr, how can I change this or put more time in the queue to create balanced matches
Maybe u should change ypur queue type to matchmaking
How to automatically push text and rules after creating a Queue text channel in NeatQueue?
Theres not an option for that
You can put a lobby details in the queue message after teams are created
ok ty
<@145305657237700608> what does priority do?
-d priority
and what is requeueing
-d requeue
<@145305657237700608> how can i see all the queues i have set up
`/serverstats info`
Is there any way to set the bot to cancel the game automatically after some time? I got a situation where people wanted to cancel the game but they just left without voting.
Bot can automatically cancel if no one shows up but this is for starting the pre game phase
After that, theres a match cleanup that you can set
But im not sure what would happen if no one votes and the timer is done, i guess it will be a tie *(Yep, result is a tie)*
`/timer matchcleanup`
Just be careful with it
It will end games even if they are running if the timer is done
what is the command
I believe she is already in matchmaking
But instead of waiting for more people to enter the queue and balance the mmr, as soon as the number of players is determined, she already creates the match
Yes, but having that wont balance them how u really want as i can see
it would only automatically create a match if everyone is within the matchmaking range
if you are in the matchmaking queue mode
I got it, thank you very much
Can I put a time limit on the matchmaking queue?
I would like to put something for example, if in 5 minutes I don't find a match with a maximum difference of 150 points, do it with those in the queue
No theres not something like that
Oh okay
You can increase the value of the range every 15 seconds with `/matchmaking leniency` if you wanna check out
Is 15 a good number?
15 is the default
Hmm, would it be possible to seperate creating the bracket and starting the first matches for the tournament functionality? I want to be able to edit the bracket first, update any team swaps manually, and then start the first round
It doesn't appear that that's built in at the moment
`/tournament create  auto_create_matches:False`
or `/tournament config autocreatematches mode:Disabled`
am I misunderstanding this section? https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/April/29/762_Discord_13h-01m_303x64.png
it appears that no matter what the start command will create the bracket, AND start the first round regardless of auto_create_matches
It's that I want in order of:

create tournament bracket
edit pre-existing matchups to manual
start first round, and every subsequent round will auto start

I would definitely have auto_create_matches to true, or at least set to true after the first round
auto_start_on_fill means when the "queue" fills up, it will start the tournament
which means generating the bracket
but if auto_create_matches is off, it won't make start any matches in discord
I have created a ''placements'' role so that the multiplier is 1.5 mmr, but it is happening to me that there are people who give the 75 mmr but to others the multiplier is not applied and it only gives them the default 50
Why is this happening?
they definitely have the role?
someone else mentioned that role multipliers sometimes didn‚Äôt work, perhaps it‚Äôs bugged
If I would cancel a game from April, 2 days after the end of the month April (using monthly leaderboards), will this affect the leaderboard for April? I would like to know just in case.
My guess it wont affect if the lb is done and its already for the next month since this game was registered in another month
iirc it should tie to whatever stats were for that month
ex: changing the queue name and modifying old stats wouldn‚Äôt update current stats
it would be on the old leaderboard
Sometimes it gets bugged when people don‚Äôt even get MMR for their wins for some reason <@145305657237700608> I‚Äôve been getting it often maybe 3 to 5 times a week
And those are people people that notice^
at first it seems like it doesn't work well, but as the games go by the mmr starts to count well. That's what I saw after a while, in case it helps you know what the error is.
my match channels are being cleaned before voting, how do I fix it?
Wdym?
How long are your games
20 min
Have u changed the match cleanup?
yeah
without wanting to
Then change it back
Default is 5400 seconds
`/timer matchcleanup`
oh okay, thank you
how do I make the readyup button time to be 5 minutes?
-d lobbychannel timer
good evening <@145305657237700608> , there is a problem I have come accross when it comes to creating a leaderboard for a specific queue channel. I voted for the bot but it still won't let me add a leaderboard.
<#919709100114346076>
will unblock you
hello, can someone help me out?
anyway, thanks for your incredible work <3
currently there is no way to automatically remove it
a staff member must clear the player
alright, ty :)
Is there a way to automatically give someone a role once they are registered??
registered meaning using /register, or just joining queue?
./register
I want to give people a role literally just called "Registered" üòÖ
Also... what is the formatting for registering a Rainbow 6 account
you can do something like
-d autoroles games set
give them a Registered role between 0 and 100000 games
Lastly... how are you supposed to format your account when going to register
*I have also tried "JJ_LEL", which is my actual R6 gamer tag
what platform
it should just be your tag
although it uses r6stats which seems to be struggling right now
ohhhhh
https://r6stats.com/api/player-search/jj_lel/pc
that'll do it
doesnt load for me right now
it wont
hold on 1 sec
R6 stats shut down
it no longer runs
oh what lmao
Siege was dying for a while üòÖ
Yea... I have a buddy of mine that ran a collegiate r6 league and he told me all about that
guess registering wont work for now, you should probably not use that command anyways
and just rely on the internal MMR system fully
where everyone starts at the same MMR
The idea is that everyone does when they get the registered role
you can use
-d requireign
similar but doesnt fetch MMR
or dont use either
that will still activate that 0 game solution to give the registered role right?

It would be possible to make a choice mode where the captain, who is not in a party, can choose 2 people at once
For example, if two players fall in a duo, the solo captain could choose two people in a row in the draft, is it possible to do this?
Is there any function for people to register their in-game names using this bot?
hi we're getting constant vote for access now when we try to just look around on the leaderboard how do i fix it

<@648635725964902411> sorry for ping but I am wondering how to create a new queue name so I can create a seperate leaderboard. everytime I try to create a seperate leaderboard, it keeps bringing up the previous queue name from a different queue I have created despite me making a new one with a different name that should pop up aswell
<@145305657237700608>
The names that pop up doesnt mean youre limited to those, just put the new queue name
i did so and it keeps trying to connect to the other one, or it's saying no queues found
The new queue in the new channel, then link the new channel with the another new channel and put the leadearboard

these are the only image locations and cant be resized, i worry the bottom is too large though
not really, but if a team has too many players the other team will be able to pick multiple times
okay, thank you
Nah it's not that big i think so

it‚Äôs not possible currently

-d rolerequirement
probably wont add/change
since its very minor
<@145305657237700608> so, would you mind joining the server I work with to fix something the owner did with the bot? I have no idea what he did with it. (I want to yell.) And now it's being really weird with how it is handling our queues. And I have no idea where to look or what to do with it.
there is a /logs command to see the history of commands used
could help
Tell your unusual activities
<@924457308656922675> can you explain? I'm even having a problme understanding
Okay, so what he did was he changed the name of the channel that's set for joining queues. And then changed it back. And it completely messed up how the bot is working.
He didn't ask his bot people about it before he did it. ü•≤
changing channel names shouldn‚Äôt do anything
what‚Äôs happening now
He changed the name of the queue channel. After he did that, it started creating it's own "Queue" Category where it shows the current queue numbers/VCs (we want it to stay under the original category...as well as disabled the auto pull/put back from VCs
That's all I can remember
sounds like
-d channel category
but it‚Äôs not related to channel names, nothing is
Ooooo oki I see I see, I fixed the auto move thing but we didn't know how to fix the main category thing
yea it should show up in /logs
any command will
<@145305657237700608> okay, so doing channel category messed with the auto drag & when Majesty enabled it again, it is back to doing vcs & text channels in the wrong category
And it created a 3rd category
screenshot? and what‚Äôs the config code
how to i put an mp4 into the queue message?
<@145305657237700608> üôÇ
thats not possible
it has to be a gif?
yea it only supports images
as far as i know
ty ty
i tried mp4
to no avail
And for the sake of sounding silly, where can I find the config code? A lot has changed with the bot since I used it a long time ago for warface & I wasn't apart of the initial setup of this particular server.
-d config save
ty it's GCOJB
I have to say, though I'm relearning a lot, it's really quite impressive how much this has grown & how much better it is. ‚ù§Ô∏è It was good before but I love to see the growth of it.
üòÑ do `/channel category category_mode:Parent`
Okay, I did that.
I'll let you know, should know shortly as we have 4 in queue now lol
Okay, so I did that. It's still not creating the team channels/vcs in the right category & it stopped auto dragging. I enabled the auto drag again & I'm waiting to see if it did what it did when we enabled that last time & create yet another category
And it won't autodrag at all now lol
Quick question, if I had a party queue set for 5v5, and one party had example 10 players, would all 10 players need to join the queue channel for it to continue through the voting, or just 5?
all of mine corrected itself so maybe it was the api trying to catch up. Idk, discord does weird discord things. But everything is back to working as it should
Hi, how do i get the leaderboard to not reset monthly?
assuming you have monthly stats enabled
it will show an empty leaderboard until you have games played
thanks
how do results get posted and how does the game end
hey guys i voted and it doesnt do the leaderboard still
bro i voted and it still doesnt work
<#919709100114346076>
re: this, it looks like the party needs to be the exact size of teamsize #, I'm wondering if it's possible to have a party of 6 queue versus a party of 5, (because of sub, captain, etc)
wondering if I'm going to have to tell my parties to only have currently playing people in the party or if I can resolve it so they can just invite to 6/7 and still queue into a 5
because the process is important:

I needed to re-apply the Team vs Team with no requirement for matching number, and just upped the team limit to 10. you will also need to set the /readyup mode to disable
Still having trouble with the leaderboard. Doesn't seem to load for our queue. Made sure requirements to show is down to 1. Wondering if this is on y'alls end, happening for anyone else, or if I'm just missing something
if its team vs team,  i *think* you can have teams with different sizes
whats your channel ID ?
or just invite real quick and ill check
Yep, I set it to not require teams to match the team size, then disabled ready up
so its good?
Sent you an invite in DMs, while I'm not admin, I can give you admin to the bot. Thanks for the help in advance
Going afk for a sec as we do have a playtest running. @ me if you come back please and thanks

Understood
does the challonge tournament integration have a way to generate the brackets inside a community? I want to be able to share admin access/api access to admins automatically
when the tournament starts, it will automatically generate the brackets
no no I mean
I want it to generate the tournament in a challonge community where I can have collaborators ready
versus going into the bracket after the fact and adding collaborators indvidually
whats a challonge community?
https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/May/03/792_chrome_22h-07m_1878x1031.png
https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/May/03/793_chrome_22h-07m_1786x1135.png
in this, if neatqueue would generate brackets within the challonge community, collaborators I give admin access to would have admin to all tournaments generated

currently, I would need to individually add admins to each tournament bracket generated
im looking at their API and not seeing anything regarding communities :/
hmm, I'll look around myself also
sounds good, if you find something lmk
I think it might be the subdomain field

https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/May/03/794_chrome_22h-10m_1278x322.png
https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/May/03/795_chrome_22h-10m_839x61.png
I'm pretty sure this is the method, with subdomain
your example URLs are formed like `subdomain.challonge.com/url` ?
Seems like so, so pushing [subdomain] and [url] with the API looks like it would create the bracket within the subdomain (challonge community) with custom URL
I'm not actually a coder so this is my guess on what it looks to be?
OK, so I quickly went to test the API and sending the parameter ``tournament[subdomain]:{domain here}`` created the tournament within the community:

what categories?
same spectator role command
<@434169405300277248>

should be visible in `/tournament create` now
https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/May/04/798_Discord_09h-13m_393x363.png doesn't appear to be so?
hmm, looks like I can't run the command anymore either https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/May/04/799_Discord_09h-19m_444x574.png
might have to restart ur discord
got it
I'll do a restart maybe it's my end
discord is bugging out
its not even an activity
great, looks good
Today, the bot was unable to create channels due to a Discord limit. We fixed that issue, but now it's tagging the @moderator and @xgc roles whenever queue is ready
excuse me, i have this error
how can solution that?
ok, i do that
sorry
that‚Äôs the only way to let staff roles see the private threads
ok, I just did a live test just before the tournament stream - I realized I needed to do /tournament refresh to update the bracket, but ALSO that every player in the party needs to use ready up
is there any way to set the tournament queues to ``/readyup mode mode:Disabled``? I know for certain that the queue inherited uses readyup mode disabled, so it ignored that
currently it explicitly sets the readyup mode when creating a tournament, regardless of existing settings...
you would have to change the setting after starting the tournament
so it would be 
```/tournament create
/tournament start
/readyup mode mode:disabled
[update the bracket on challonge]
/tournament refresh
/tournament startmatches```
?
that looks right yea
anytime you make updates on challonge directly, you would need to do`/tournament refresh` so the bot can sync up with the changes
yep, i realized after the fact
I updated the bracket and didn't refresh, and it made the wrong lobbies
the methodology btw for any searchers:

I needed to cancel the bracket to adjust it, then restart it 
then you would need to refresh
is there any way to set the ready up in the tournament command? not a huge deal if not, I'll just add it to "the process"
i think i should just update it so that it respects the queue setting
instead of always setting it
yea, i can update that now. If there is a queue in the channel already, it won't mess with the config
except for the necessary changes
perfect i appreciate it

I know it's not currently possible, but was interested to see if it was implementable.
perhaps, i guess would have to think about a way to customize that
Excuse me, how can create a queue for free for all?
Appreciate it, it's the format we're going to use in the future if it gets implemented
does this work for xbox aswell? or strictly pc?
What do you mean
Its a bot for discord
If u have discord u can use it
with the queue and all, when you do the set up
Im assuming xbox has a support for everything
All discord functionality
There wont be any problems i would say
<@145305657237700608> it is making teams without the player but still adding then to the channel
anything special about the queue ?
https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/May/05/806_Discord_13h-20m_554x83.png seems to be having an issue registering accounts right now
I tried with my own account id that definitely worked previously
what‚Äôs that account?
Zendikar#hooj
I've been having issues with users in the server also
using other NA accounts trying to register, but not working
seems like the api might have changed, so any users work?
ill try again
seems like it's still error-ing out
Not sure what's going on
nobody work?
I'm trying with other users
not working with any pro tracker, my tracker, other user's tracker riot id
going through using user id's, none working unfortunately
yea the API i am using doesn't seem to work now
hmm, strange - fixable? or should I disable register
so map bans are like. veto system?
depends if i can find another API to use, i would disable for now
yes, map bans remove them from the map pool
only for a certain game?
(queue)
We apparently have a queue/game that was never closed, or something. Is there a way to find out where this is? I've tried setting up a different server stats channel to see if that one was just bugged, but I'm still getting 22, which is the amount for a full game.

We're also not getting any complaints about not being able to queue up due to still being in a game, so I'm not for sure where the number is coming from. It's been like this for a day-ish, I believe.
hmm whats the server ID?
so my server is big and I do have many queues, do I need to make a few channels for each queue to register (set ign)?
also the /queueentry channel set command doesn't work
I have set a voicechannel but when I join the one I set, it doesnt let me join the queue
you have to change `/queueentry methods` as well
i dont see any reason to
how to let players from different queues do /ign in the registration channel
I cant link a channel to more than a queue I believe
by default using /ign will set your IGN across all queues in the server
so should just have to do it once
alright
<@145305657237700608> does the autorole apply for all queues or I need to set it up for each one?
its per queue
so I should do it for each queue right
how do i remove one of the options from the team selection
i want to remove balanced
-d teamselection
Sorry for the late reply.

Server ID:
1184332531307384924
We have one queue atm, and it's showing 44 instead of 22
hmm i also see the 1 queue
and nothing else
Well at least I know I don't have an open queue anywhere
I cannot
it says :

No queue found!
If you want a queue in this channel, run /startqueue or /setup!
If you want to control a specific queue from this channel, use /link!
Hello~ the option `false` doesn't seem to disable the inactivity timeout for queue as this message still shows after toggling it to `false`: "Player Left Queue Due To Inactivity". This did not happen with the previous queue (which did not have the `false` option being toggled), until I had newly set it up again via `/setup`.

Have also set the `/timer queuereset` to 604800 to have the queue reset in 1 week, not sure if this would have led to that issue? Or would a user's Discord status set to `Idle` affect this?

**EDIT:** Another thing that I had noticed was that I did not get booted for inactivity even after logging off Discord for 2 hours or not checking my Discord for 30 minutes. But my status is set to `Do Not Disturb` permanently ü§î
I changed the names format to [$] prefix via the commands but MMR doesn't show in the nicknames
if people are already in queue the afk timer might still affect them
what do you mean about not getting booted for inactivity?
oh, the afk timer still affects them even if I've toggled it to be `false`? Because that didn't happen in our previous queue hmmm
like if I don't check Discord for 30 mins or go offline for like an hour or so I'm still in the queue and not removed for inactivity like this (user's name in Chinese is me):
it depends if the afk timer is on or off
nvm, this shouldn't happen
it should be working fine, i would make sure its disabled for that queue again
I think I've tried disabling it twice now haha
should I just remake the queue and set the configs again?

UPDATE: I went ahead to remake it and set the afk timer to on with a 864000 seconds duration, hopefully no one gets booted out due to inactivity now üôè
<@145305657237700608>
I would appreciate it if you can help me with this üôå
<@145305657237700608> did you maybe update bot to show players names in captains pick?
it should nickname when people join queue, if its not, make sure the bot has higher perms than everyone
i didn't touch anything with the captain selection recently, what are you asking about ?
maybe ure forgot.. üòõ
in captains selection, to show the roles
if theyre specified in queue ofc
is the command right I just did `/ratinginname format format:[$] location:prefix`
oh... right
also do
-d ratinginname toggle
thanks, can I prevent the bot from making another queue voice channel once players join the linked vc to the queue
so the bot only makes team1 and team2 vc, and the temp channel for picking
& if the bot can create another category for each game instead of making all channels in the same category
-d lobbychannel toggle
-d channel category
This is not a visible command for me (admin). Wondering if it got removed, as channels in our server are no longer locked to teamsize.
nope that has never existed, the bot is going crazy
Lmao
the channel lock will be removed if you do any of these:
- disable /channel restrictions
- add a spectator role
- add a staff role
What would be the point of the spectator role if the channel unlocks for everyone if added? Or am I not reading correctly?
Is this something on Discord's side via perms that the bot can't control, or do I just need not utilize the staff and spectator roles to bring back channelsize restrictions?
I'm sure I'm just missing the proper command here, as I've removed all spectator and staff roles, as well as disabled and enable the channel restrictions command. However it's still not locking channels to the team size.
Fixed with permission commands, however I still don't see the point of the spectator role if it unlocks the channel for everyone.
it doesn‚Äôt unlock for everyone
by default team channels block everyone from joining
For us it still shows all players can join. However, I'm thinking this is due to our verification bot which gives a separate role to all those who join the server and verify. So while the bot is stopping @ everyone from joining. It isn't stopping @verified members.
yep that sound right
if the verified role grants access to all channels by default
you could use
-d voicechannels permissions set
That's what I ended up doin'. Awesome, sorry for the trouble, thanks for all the support
How does an admin cancel a queue without having to use /cancel
An admin can cancel a queue without having to use "/cancel" by using the command "/outcome cancel". This command allows the admin to cancel the queue instantly without the need for a vote.
You can do it via buttons, if u have set a staff channel
Good morning, how do I delete a specific queue name?

in /info
hi, i wanted to ask, is there any way to set a max of matches at the same time? i'm using the bot in a cs source discord server and we have only 3 game servers, so we can't have more than 3 queues at the same time
<@145305657237700608> why is this happening
these are the ranks
now its gone back
Not possible, you can do that but youll have to manually do it everytime
was that all at the same time?
Hi, I configured the bot for a @Member role, but everyone in the member role can read the chat of the qeue and type, how can I make it so that only members of that qeue can read it?
does the Member role have explicit access to all channels?
if so, you will need to modify the permissions of new channels manually with
-d tempchannels permissions set
<@145305657237700608> how do i delete a certain queue name

wdym delete the name?
lemme get screenshot
i want to delete 4 mans queue but I don't know how to
They should disappear if you reset stats for those queue names

So we are wanting to do a very large draft tournament. We want to have a queue open at least a couple of hours in advance so people have a good window to sign up for it. The biggest issue for me is that when you join two queues, and one of them starts, you get taken out of the other queue pool. Idk if this is due to us using server-wide stats, or what, or if there's simply a setting I can adjust. I want people to be able to queue up in the tournament queue, while also being able to play in the regular queue.
if i reset the stats, wouldn't that reset the mmr?
good point, it should stop removing automatically from tournament queues
ill make that change today
I could be wrong, but I'm fairly certain that the stats are tied to that queue name. So whatever mmr they've earned in that queue is separate.
NeatZ will probably correct me lol
The queue names here just represent all the unique stats names that currently have some data
Well we wouldn't be doing a tournament queue. With tournament queues, you have to join with a team, and it doesn't draft. Correct? Or is there a way to draft in the tournament queue?
oh, correct, you are just talking about another normal queue
So is there a way to do what I mentioned with a regular queue? Where you can queue up in multiple queues that are running instead of being pulled out? If it's a setting thing, I would only turn it on when we do these large drafts with a large sign-up period
currently no, i can add a setting to disable automatically removing from other queues
how do i delete one of them?
by resetting stats for that queue
so basically all the data would be wiped
my bad
This would be amazing. Is this easy, or would I need to wait a while for it? I'm perfectly fine with either. Just curious
i can do it right now basically, give me like 20 mins to test

Says ‚Äùthis interaction failed‚Äù
Cant try out the queue system
Realized now that it might be due to slow wifi
So this is possibly a separate thing, I'm not for sure. Is there a way to get around this?
One of my mods sent me that, showing he wasn't able to join
well i guess, can't they just wait until after their current setup finishes

I am trying to start a quing list does anyone know how to do that
`/staffrole add`
`/setup`
can you change the names of tournament players
i am doing a tournament where only the leader readys up but can i put the bracket to their team name
do i have to do /setup everytime I want to start one
No, quick way is /startqueue
ok sounds good thank you so much just new to using this
Channel's topic have attached a basic guide for the bot üòÑ
well the team name matches the party/player name
if you can change the name on challonge then sure
what would i do to stop a queue list
Check the guide
Its /endqueue
so how do i reset like the entire leaderboard not only mmr but games too?
or is the only way to simply redo the q?
-d managestats reset all
ty ‚ù§Ô∏è
does reporting the scores affect how NQ interprets the tournament queue? we've set up an API to pull all the wins/losses, and want to be able to also take the map scores (ex: 13-7) entering them in the tournament. I think we don't set the scores during, but setting them after each match has been finished shouldn't be a problem?
nope the bot wont care about that
it only sets the winner/loser
so say while the tournament is live, I can edit the 1-0 score to something else?
can i make the time the matchmaking-queue takes for MMR differences while queuing shorter?
like someone with 2k mmr vs 1.2k, thats 8 minutes
-d matchmaking
oh nice nice
the leniency changes how fast the range expands
my brain isnt braining rn
but i think ik what u mean
default is 15, so 30 would double the speed
what do i set to get it instant? or barely instant
just experiment really, try out 100
would only take a minute max
100 on range and on leniency? i dont rlly understand the laniency <:sadcat:1179569615911800842>
every 15 seconds, the range will expand by the leniency value
the docs better explain how the matchmaker works
so if i set it higher it will go faster at the end ig?
if you want to automatically start when the queue fills, change your /queuetype to PUGs
Hey I just had a quick question on how the monthly leaderboard resets work 

If i keep rolling stats, how do monthly leaderboards work? Is there like a tracker (that has pictures or screenshots) that shows the end of month stats for each month? Also do ALL stats get removed (mmr & wins) orr?
The tracker starts when u hit the command to change it to monthly, it will treat it as a new month, so the recommendation is to run the command at the beginning of the month, but yeah the stats will reset every mont basically
<@145305657237700608> how to remove the options for how queue teams can be done and just make it go straight to captain voting
-d teamselection
no need to ping everytime you have a question btw, just leave it here
huge issue with tournament
after the implementation of tournament subdomains, using the /tournament refresh command no longer updates the bracket
i've updated the brackets to these, but we still have the wrong matchups being generated once i use the startmatches command
for example, parasyte was getting queued with copium originally, and instead of the queue showing asayake vs parasyte, it still queued copium and parasyte
says the tournament hasnt started?
sorry, yes the picture was just taken to confirm with the director but the tournament is started
https://challonge.com/Underpeel_S4_Kickoff_Top_8_Drafts
let me restart and you can try refreshing again
https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/May/11/825_Discord_10h-06m_578x790.png
we aren't using it anymore we needed the tournament to start
i'll have to test it another day
im not sure how it would be related to the bot since the bot doesn't store the matches
it fetches from challonge directly
then looks like something is wrong with the communication with challonge during the pull, isn't that the point of refresh like you said earlier?
it fetched the matchups at some point earlier
and using the refresh updates the brackets in NQ
anytime it starts making matches, it refreshes from challonge
what is the /refresh command for in that case
https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/May/11/826_Discord_10h-09m_371x130.png
i guess that would more-so be if the matches are automatically created
instead of when using the command
I see, well either way it looks like using /startmatches doesn't get an updated challonge bracket
I can't check your code so I wouldn't know how it's implemented but I know for certain that however it's working atm it doesn't fetch the correct bracket at time of /startmatches
Is there anyway to keep like a running count of all stats üò¶ I want it to reset every month but still have an overall count somewhere
Of like how many games have been played etc
monthly stats should work for that
i'll check the tournament stuff after the tournament today, but if doesn't work we can't really use it anymore
not until brackets are properly applied
only thing i can think of is the changes weren‚Äôt finalized/applied yet
i explicitly implemented it in such a way that the bot doesn‚Äôt store matches ever, so it can always fetch the most up to date versions
i'm very certain I had the tournament started again after editing the bracket, even refreshing multiple times
who knows,, I'll do another test
OK, update after having manually input the scores and then 2nd round showed up, the bot does create the correct queues
just wasn't for first round, and will need to do more testing
``` ```also, tournament queues have a player limit of 5 despite parties  being 6+

needed to drag users in
what‚Äôs the team size?
in the queue, it's 10, when I ran the tournament command, I hadn't put any number in because you said it inherits it
https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/May/11/829_Discord_11h-51m_550x375.png
when the match started, did it show 5 party members, or all 10
only 5 players each team were pinged in the queue
the queue is an exact copy of the one above but tournament coded https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/May/11/830_Discord_11h-55m_409x840.png
did the parties have all 10 players when added to the queue?
yes, i made sure of it
however let me double check with them
yes, they were in the party before the queue was clicked, so 8 players
<@145305657237700608> 

Further testing shows that it's not working properly:

The bracket was originally ``Test1 vs Test3`` and ``Test2 vs Test4``

I changed the bracket to as such below: ``Test1 vs Test2`` and ``Test3 vs Test4``
https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/May/11/831_chrome_13h-35m_669x516.png

``/tournament startmaches``

Still incorrect matchups, queueing team1 vs team3, and team2 vs team4
I tried to make it as descriptive as I could for you
appreciate the info, ill try and take a look myself
ive found a bug within the challonge library itself lol
oh no
so what happens is when you reset the bracket and create new matches, the library sees the new matches as entirely new which is great, but it doesn't clear delete the old matches from its internal cache
so it thinks there are double the matches cuz its merging 2 versions of the tournament
really annoying
Do you think it's fixable
It's okay if not because we can just use our duplicate queue method
yes, i can manually clear the match's cache so its fully clean
kind of dumb design imo, when you want to force refresh it should be wiping what it has stored
but oh well
agreed
seems to be working well now, i can reset the bracket and startmatches and it picks up the new changes
just gonna make sure everything i need is being cleared out
(I also don't want to put more work on you, but we found another issue I think with communicating with challonge but this is more about their GET calls and their API. )

When creating a bracket using the neatqueue commands, the tournaments don't show up using their Index GET API call. We tested making a tournament through their API directly and those tournaments show in our list. However, they don't show up when using NeatQueue. Examples:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1151323453908078684/1238958931942838272/image.png?ex=66412dec&is=663fdc6c&hm=a8cb6eeea64bb14235e962d80a88710f0f761376b4327360584d61bf095ce3bb&
https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/May/11/836_Discord_14h-20m_505x140.png
We're trying to be able pull the bracket data into a master sheet, but it looks like tournaments created using the tournament command (while using my account's API key) do not show under my account's tournament list
both using the subdomain ?
I am using the command "/resultschannel" to a channel called "Results" on my server. The channel "Results" is separate from the queue channel, but when a match ends, it does not post the results in "Results" channel. How do I fix this?
let me actually test that first
also i super appreciate it, we can continue to use the tournament bracket we just need to figure out the VC issue, maybe it's our end
let me know once it's live!
im looking into it now
its this tourny, right? https://challonge.com/Underpeel_S4_Kickoff_Top_8_Drafts
yeah we already moved on from it since after the first round we manually did in duplicate queues, it was able to pick up the 2nd and 3rd round fine
im seeing that it each team only has 5 or 6 players on them
so its not related to voice channels, but something with joining the queue i guess
if the parties truly were more than 5 or 6 people
all good, I think next week when we run the next weekend tournament I'll keep track of who is in what party, and what happens to VC's
I'll let you know then definitively with more data
sounds good, im comparing the party in the tournament vs the actual party and they seem to be perfectly in line
do you have an example party name that was more than 5 or 6 people
Elo Evaders
https://i.bfz.moe/png/2024/May/11/838_Discord_14h-38m_545x184.png
just to confirm, the bracket update is live now right?
not yet'
have to deploy
live now
ill check out the party issue as well
How do I make people who are in the queue auto join a queue voice call before even setting up the teams
-d lobbychannel toggle
-d lobbychannel pullall
thank you
i have 8 people in my queue and it wont start
it takes super long a loads of resets to get the queue to start
Whats your queue type
queue type? you mean like the config?
its matchmaking
That makes sense, did u read the queuetypes?
PUGs = Will start when it hits queue desired size
Matchmaking = Skill based queue (Will search till it finds  X players with a mmr within a range, that will take time)
so i gotta make it a Pug?
can it still be captains and that?
`/queuetype`
ahh ok
thankyou sm
Is it possible to make it so people are automatically queued into the next queue if someone doesn‚Äôt join and the match is cancelled
Should be by default
`/requeue matchcancelled`
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to make it so people can have anywhere from 3-5 people on a team
when a queue is filled it makes a private channel with players who are in that queue
is there a way to allow everyone to see the queue channel but they can't type or do anything in there only the ppl who are in the queue can
You can disable channel restrictions and change the perms of the tempchannels for a desired inqueue role
what's the command to do that
channel restrictions
autoroles inqueue
tempchannels permissions set
alright thanks
How do I make players be automatically move to their respective teams voice chat after setup completed? And if they are not in discord or join in the channels in 5 minutes, they will get banned from queue for 1 hour? <@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>
First one should be by default
`/voicechannels moveteam`
The ban is
`dodge autoban`
The problem is: this only functions enable the Voice Queue Setup channel and I don't want this channel created, I want only for players to be moved directly to the respective Team A or Team B voice channel
Also, the dodge autoban is set for the Voice Queue Setup channel, which I don't want. I wan't it to be for the Team A / Team B voice channel
How do I do this?
Not possible
You cant move someone if they are not even in a channel
Wait, I know that
What I mean is: if a player is in a normal voice chat room, I want him to be moved directly to the Team A or Team B for their match and skip the Voice Setup Queue channel, which is not necessary at all
Can I invite you to the discord and maybe you'll see what I mean?
I get what you mean
But is not possible, it will take the players from the queue vc
If you maybe just want all of this automatically, the way would be setting a lobby channel, that will be your waiting room, then from that channel everyone gets dragged to the queue vc and then to teams automatically
But youll need the queue vc
Ok, so basically I have the queue vc but as soon as players are moved to the queue vc automatically, they are moved again to the respective teams vc, is that it?
If everyone joins and your setup phase is random yes
It's a solo queue pug system with highest elo captains to choose, 2 teams, 5 players per team
Will this work?
Yes, but they wont be moved as soon as they join the vc because theres simply no teams chosen yet
If I activate Move teams after teams creation will it work?
thats default
Isnt default when setup is done?
sorry, yes
That will move them when teams are created yep
by setup it is intended as match completly ready, after everything is concluded, or simply the first step? this one being, captains pick
in my pug there is: 1) captains pick team; 2) map vote
all setup is after map vote?
Yes, by moving after setup means when you basically see the winnervote message and everythings done to play
In your case they will be moved to team vcs before map vote if you enable `after team creation`
nah, i want after all setup so if like a group of people talking in a public room, they will only be moved when the match is ready to be played
thats why i wanted to bypass the queue vc setup, so it wont interrupt people for no reason
then do the default moveteams
which is after all setup
He doesnt want queue vc
I mean, the lobby channel moving automatically to the queue vc would just take 1 second, theres really no interrupt
I don't want all 10 players in queue voice chat for like 1 or 2 minutes while captains are picking the players and maps are being voted
i think it should still move to team VCs
if people are in any voice
ahh maybe not
Ye but i tried and i couldn't get it working
yea you cant do what you are trying
Hey, quick question. I have 1 queue rn for 1v1s, and i wann create a second one for 2v2s, can i just do that or is there any problem?
Is there a way to move them to the queue voice channel after team setup? and then after 1 second move them to respective teams?
You can achieve that but you wont have autoban and wont have automove
You can just create a new queue in a new channel
with /setup?
If you want, or you can load the config from your 1v1 queue and change the teamsize to 2
I figured it out, it's working exacly how i wanted. It moves to que Queue for 1 second and then moves to respective teams channels
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to make it so people can have anywhere from 3-5 people on a team and it will start
also what will happen with the autoroles/ranks
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> i can't seem to override the /autoban dodge command for the /mmrpenalty - in AI support it says to not input any value after mmr penalty to but it's mandatory to type something, I type 0 and still there is no override - how can I deactivate mmr penalty in order to dodge ban be active?
After i put the role with this command when players join and get a queue they don't gain this role?
there is no mmr penalty ?
`/dodge mmrpenalty amount:` ?
there is that command but i set it to 0 in reason for the dodge autoban duration work but it doesn't :/
if they are no longer in the queue, they will lose the role
what are you trying to achieve
Players be banned for 1 hour if they dodge (not join the voice channel)
Previously I had for them to lose be both banned and lose 50MMR
I tested, they lost MMR but would not get banned
In AI support, it says that this occurs because of dodge mmr penalty override
This is what I want to achive: Players be banned for 1 hour if they dodge (not join the voice channel)
Ideal: Players be both banned for 1 hour and lose 50 MMR
`/dodge autoban duration:3600`
`/dodge mmrpenalty amount:50`
I created a role and named it @in queue
This screen rn iam in a queue and i don't have this role and the bot has all perms and a higher role than me so it should be able to give me that role
Bro, I've done that. They don't get banned...
I created another another Queue to test, the dodge auto ban duration only works if we never set dodge mmr penalty
How do I fix this then <@145305657237700608> ?
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> is there a way to make it so people can have anywhere from 3-5 people on a team and it will start
how do i remove the "random" for map votes
Hmm, forcestart is the only thing i can think of
the bot said something about subtitutions
That doesnt make sense
check <#1131752660740083763>
Its an AI, it has hallucinations, not everything that it says is true
oh ok
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>
<@648635725964902411> is that possible?
chill üò≠
Y'all like tagging
I dont think so, vote mode should remove that but it doesnt, so i would say no
Works normal for me
SOMEONE HELP
how do i disable this whole thing
-d captains selection
-d captains reshuffle
i cant disable captains?
Ah you want to change the teamselection
-d teamselection set
what do i do here
Select the teamselection you want
i have no idea what they do
whats balanced?
Balanced will try to make teams balanced
Idk why but for some reason it's not working for me
Is the role above neatq role
No it's a role i created few hours ago and it's in the bottom not above any other roles
Then im not sure why would that not work
thanks i have now what i needed
1 more question
i cant find the vc disable command
or i can find it, but not the right one
it say vcs are diabled but they still come
/lobby channel i think ok ok
`/lobbychannel toggle`
I figured out that i get the role when iam still queueing not after getting a queue
So i guess it's wrong command it shouldn't be /autoroles inqueue
I think /autoroles ingame? Right
Saw Don say it was no longer available. Is `/crosschat` not working anymore?
it partially works in its current state
its broken if the servers are across different bot nodes
and there are 2 different nodes
so its random
okay, to test, what do I put after room_name? I utilized this a long time ago, but I've tried the link, the channel name, and the config.
you can pick anything for the room name
anyone with the name can join your room
So `/crosschat join room_name: Example Name`; then it should create the room and I just copy paste same name in the other server.
also apparently it doesnt work in threads
threads cant have webhooks apparently <:TE_Shrug:856060385433616384>
<@145305657237700608> will all updates be on trello from now on?
Until a ‚Äúbigger‚Äù summarized update
can i create auto-roles for a second queue?
Hey guys,  /lobbychannel timer is not in sync with the actuall deleting/cancelling time of the room. How can I fix this?
this is happening
on top, 5minutes is the correct time i set in /lobbychannel timer command
you are in test mode
but after only a few seconds of match room creation, if no one joins it deletes in 30 seconds
i know i am, im testing everything before open up the server
Read the msg when u hit test command
kkkkkkkk
no ill still post them here
my bad
I have a question: is there a way to automatically cancel the match if any player fails to meet de 5 minutes deadline?
from what i've tested, if just 1 player joins que voicechat the match proceeds and the players missing don't get banned
i'm talking about 10man pugs, 5players per team, 2 teams
they dont get banned even after the 5min mark*
Did you test this with any other people
Without being in test mode
no, not that
It should report the missing player and ban them, altough dodge autoban sometimes bugs out and bans everyone in the queue
so, if 9 players join and player A doesn't join after 5minutes, he will be banned and the match will be cancelled automatically
this is how it's supposed to work without test mode active?
i'll test tomorrow üòâ thanks for the help! i appreciate it
<@648635725964902411> can there be a duration for the ban? Also can there be a ‚Äúwarning‚Äù for the first time offenders?
Only in seconds you can adjust the time of ban
And theres no warning
<@406194798630928384> wdyt^^
<@145305657237700608>
I got a problem
when I set rolerequiement
ppl without that role still can join the queue
any clue?
/rolerequirement add role: special role
but ppl without that role still can join this queue
I already remove and add again
use /info
and check the current role requirements
you only need 1 of the roles
Remember to remove @ everyone role
Im stupid
sorry
<@145305657237700608> anyway we have access to the api so  we can grab stats from the players?
https://api.neatqueue.com/docs
<@145305657237700608> I deleted a chat with a queue running what do I do
just type in it <@804369553449812008>
Hello, how do I not show who is in the queue?
-d anonymousqueue
I have some questions here:

1.) My ranked is 1v1, you don't need to be in call, how do I get the call removed?

2.) When the player wins, how do the player delete the chat? I think there should be a voting system for who won the match

3.) How to remove everyone's permission to see the chat?
To deactive queue vc and team channels, `/lobbychannel toggle` and `/voicechannels teamchannels`
In order to get a winner the players needs to vote in the message, there is a message where it shows the options to vote for the winner
And if u remove everyone perms to see the chat then the players in the queue cant vote and there wont be a winner
But it doesn't show it here, it only shows the "ping" button
It must have been because I can't deactivate the call
Because the match didnt even start
Hey, just checking to see if you found anything. If not, we'll run it again this weekend run and see how it is being set up
havent had the chance to try yet, but i will within the next day or 2
appreciate it, we're getting entries finalized wednesday and I'll take screenshots of each party entry as well in case
<@145305657237700608> the command to disable the call is not working
pretty sure it works
Did u run the two commands i said?
oh now it was. thanks!
now my discord server is bugged, wtf
even with everyone's permission not to see the position, they can see the chat
-d message queuemessage image
<@145305657237700608> i have a massive problem, i just updated some stuff with the premium version and change the queue name, and all of my leaderboards are jsut completly empty now
my ranks are resetted too
Because stats are attached to the unique queue name
So if u change them you reset them
Change the name back
theres an options for the bot to pick side(ct or terror) after teams selected and map selected? <@648635725964902411>
So you actually cant actually change the queue names?
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
you can change the queue name, just use /leaderboardconfig sharedstats set
and set it to the old queue name
Not really, but you can kinda achieve it with a custom voting menu and setting it to random
The idea would be, make the random voting menu, and the two options CT or TT, you could format the result with Team 1:, then it automatically would choose a side for team 1 always, and then you already know whats the side of the second team
can i make it random ? the point of that is to be random
Can you transfer credits
yes, either use what don soap said, or use /lobbydetails set
-d lobbydetails set
if you click the link, the docs have examples of picking random data
sure just DM me
Nvm we good thx tho for responding fast
come devo fare per giocare ancora?????? un avversario non rispondeva piu √® la prima volta che mi capita quindi ho chiuso tutto e aperto di nuovo ma ora mi dice che devo votare ma non ho capito dove
English please
If I were to have the bot display everyone's mmr in their name and I am the owner of the server... it currently unable to change my nickname to display my own personal MMR, how do i get it to where it is able to update my MMR as well?
It cant if youre the server creator
Youre basically untouchable with that, no matter what perms no one can change the server's creator nickname
It'll show me on the leaderboard though atleast??
Yeah obv
For whatever reason, I've got 10 people that are filling up my queue but it is not initiating the team selection process
change your /queuetype to PUGs
you are probably in matchmaking, which waits for a more fair match
matchmaking issues üíÄ
``/matchmaking leniency value:`` use this and set 1000 if you dont want to change to pugs
can you change the queue to only random and balanced?
You can remove the whole vote thing too
Hey, this solution from AI Support is not working: Set the "can speak" parameter of the spectator role to false within the parameters of the role. This will prevent the spectator role from being able to speak inside a team voice chat in a specific match category. However, if the spectator role is part of the team, they will still be able to speak as intended.
How can I fix this?
I setted server role PUG Spectator as BOT Spectator role
1. PUG Spectator role has server permission to join channels and to speak in them.
2. BOT Spectator role has enable to speak False so he doesn't speak in other's teams voice chat
However, if a person with Spectator role queues and plays a match, he still can't speak in his own team voice channel.

How do I fix this so that Spectator role CAN'T speak in other's voice chat but CAN speak in his teams voice chat?

I have no clue what it means/does
Also on a 4 team queue is there a way to make it so you vote for a 1st 2nd 3rd 4th place?
Just gotta read whats inside the parenthesis
It means the drafting order
Snake means, first captain drafts one, then the second captain drafts two, and then all the drafts are two players by each captain
drafts what?
will it only ask for a winner?
The players
like whos on their team?
Draft means the captain choose which player they want to play in their team
ok thanks
in a 1v1v1v1 will only one person gain mmr and others lose?
is there a way to make it so there is a vote for 1st 2nd 3rd 4th?
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> can you give me some feedback on how to fix this please? üôÇ
Theres not a way to prevent someone speaking in a other team's vc
Besides on its own
Anyone in the queue can join their opossite team and talk
I know, I'm talking about outsiders who are not in queue currently and want to join some match so their friends streams for them
These people, with spectator role can't speak, as it is intended.
The problema is: these same guys with spectator role, when they go to play in their own match, they can't also speak. Which makes no sense because they are in their own team voice chat
the players should be getting explicit access to speak in their team channel
<@145305657237700608> In this queue people were unable to vote (looks like the vote was not visible): https://www.neatqueue.com/transcript/266243131853373440/2767
have you gotten around to checking? or if you think it would be a good catch all do use the tempchannel/voicechannel permissions to allow the "player league" role to connect/speak (I've never used this command so unsure if this would open the 5 person limit and connection restriction)
whats the command for the automatic queue bans like i want to get rid of that how do i do that?
`/dodge autoban`
have you gotten around to checking? or
How can i do this thing?
In my server there are same Roles like: Iron (200 mmr), Gold (300 mmr) and i want that if a player reaches a role (like iron), he can't go down.
For example if I have 350 mmr i lose mmr normally, but if I have 300 mmr (the minimum mmr required for a role), I can't go down under 300 (299, 298, ecc....)
When some1 doesnt join vc in time, it bans them even tho it says they can get replaced. What the setting to prevent any1 from getting banned or increasing the timer u have to join vc?
ive tried use the documentation page, just not very good at finding the right settings
-d dodge autoban
-d lobbychannel timer
Thank u very much!
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> my leaderboards arent showing up

could be discord

fixed it
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> how do you delete all the random shared stat names
that i accidently added
Is the bot down for anyone else?
yep prob
it doesn't let you hit ready and if you do a test it starts to crash in games
seems fine to me?
Same. It was pinging everyone in the queues over and over. It was honestly comical watching the people being tagged go crazy
It's not technically down, just had some bad weed
When doing it in test mode it starts to start like 5 games
and it won't let you hit ready
I was able to cancel the queue, so I did that. Wish I would've done a tie now so I could share the transcript
It shows this
But it also sort of keeps up with the amount of players queued at the same time
But it won't let the last person queue up, even if subbed for queue dodge
The last pic is what the person trying to ready up was getting
It usually also only allows one ping, but it let them do more
i do see some errors
very strange this happened out of no where at the same time on both bot nodes
i wonder if there was an api update
could you share your config?
as it also happened to me, I leave you the configuration
via /config save
Select11s_May162024
I just swapped to VC mode instead of Ready Up button mode to see if that works
So the config will show that
yup i see the same error
I have no idea how much you make off this bot, but its not enough lol. You're awesome and always super helpful
this is truly a weird error, its straight from discord
and its occuring on both nodes + the beta bot when hosting locally
and i havent modified anything in days
Anything I can do to help?
not really, its Discord's fault lol
its related to sending buttons
which is kinda a large part of NeatQueue
i knew i wasn't going crazy on this one, not my fault for once
why isnt it just giving the role?
<@145305657237700608> chrm
The bot is down
<@857633321064595466>
like offline wym?
One says mmr, and one says streak. It looks like you have a role tied ro streaks that's fighting against the mmr role
good catch
<#919709100114346076>
oh i have to remove the streak thing?
i thougt itll remove auto when i add another type of autorole k thx
Either remove it, change it, or something. They apparently both point to the same one

You're welcome
tysm
worked
i suck
The error is caused by editing a message that contains buttons, so yea thats a very common thing the bot does
but Discord said they are working on a fix
Neatz when next giveaway fr

<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> how do you delete all the random shared stat names
1. Rule
Do not ping don soap
how do i fully set it up for rainbow 10 mans
You can go to the basic guide
https://www.neatqueue.com/
can i prevent players requeue before theyre game is over? they vote and then theyre able to requeue
<@648635725964902411>
They should disappear if you reset stats for those queue names.

The stats are tied to the queue name. So whatever mmr they've earned in that queue is separate from the others.
`/requeue condition condition:Winner Selected`
thanks man
They already have no stats on them and no queue uses them
And i just tried but it didnt work
Then idk what you're talking about lol
i want to get rid of these
yea those are tied directly to the player stats
a queue name only will show if someone has stats
only the bottom 5 are attached to queues
the top 2 dont have any queue or any stats
how do i delete them
-d managestats reset all
for those names
What command controls this functionality?
why r u here?
-d queueentry survey
-d queueentry survey add
idk it let me
bruh
can i not talk ? i  wont if you dont want me to
no bro ur good
this is just the support server

Thank you. Follow up question. Been trying to set the required votes to 2 for both winner confirmation and cancel confirmation but it's only requiring 1. Any thoughts?
-d requiredvotes winner
-d requiredvotes cancel
Right, I've done those commands, as shown in my screenshot above, but it's sitll only requiring 1. Is there a permission that it needs?
huh who are you henry if you dont mind me asking
no that‚Äôs the command
did u try a new match after changing them?
but i did play a little more
not talking to you brother
wait did you make yeeps
or did you make the discord server
this server is the support server for the <@857633321064595466> bot
yea i know samzy sayed this is
can i not talk in this chat i wont if im not supposed to
<#857677776471588894> is more appropriate
well can i talk with you guys?
i mean i wont if im not supposed to because your the like best well all of you are good and way better then me
Yeah, I've tried cancelling the queue and restoring config as well
do you guys do talk about problems here
Problems about the bot yes
Hey <@145305657237700608> I've sent to you a message about the bot in DM
The register command seems to not work at all
Would love to use this feature so help would be appreciated
if i have pugs for solos can i make another category for pugs of teams? and if its possible can i make it with leaderboard with team names? <@648635725964902411>
hey sorry to bother again <@145305657237700608> or any moderators
there's a player who already set a role but can't see the queue
even though he can see the bot and press join queue
but the bot shows nothing
idk what's the problem
ty for your time
here's the context
You can just create another queue, if u wanna load the previous one `/config save`, then `/config load` but theres not an option to display lbs with team names
can i make the leaderboard for teams?
You can make the leadeaboard, but it will just show stats individually
how do i set up the bot for ten mans
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
its a discord setting
"EMBEDS AND LINK PREVIEWS" i believe
Is there a way for people to require a role in order to queue up for teams?
or is that not an option available
discord role, or like an in-game role?
discord role
-d rolerequirement add
is that for the individual queue or the team queue? (image is for team queue)
any queue
how do I make it specific for individual queue and team queue respectively?
its a per-queue setting, like most settings
would you be willing to show me step-by-step, or is there a video for it?
I'm just having difficulty figuring this out properly
quick question is there a way to view the list of roles that are in the rolerequirement?
-d info
thanks so much, you both helped me figure things out
/setup
dang it it didt work
is there a command to turn off the no mmr option
``/mmr change allow_disable false`` ig
thx g
i need someone to help me in general to set up the bot, can anybody help please?
im not smart
im srry
<@1194079999846793248> could you help me please?
<@145305657237700608> Sorry to ping you, but is the /register not working rn? I've tried having multiple people register and it keeps returning with an error with fetching account even when format is correct
Mode: Valorant
NOOOOO
welp sorry for you shiza
hope you can get it fixed
You have a basic guide on neatqueue's website
why does the ai-support say im a staff?
<:Shrug:1171270284670668830>
<@648635725964902411> sorry for pinging but why does it say that
plz stop shit posting with the ai
OK ill stop
ü§ì ‚òùÔ∏è
TAKE THE POWER AWAY
I CANT CONTROLL IT
Its just an ai
It doesnt think
and stop sending random messages in the support channel
Just following up on the issue I was having with setting the required votes.

I used the command **/requiredvotes cancel type:X** and tried Two, Ten, Majority, etc. but it still is only looking at one person's vote. This applies to the winner confirmation too. Not sure what I'm missing here
how do  i make it so it shows the people queued?
How can i make spectator roles only spectate specific queues
``/anonymousqueue mode:Disabled``
just edit the /tempchannels permission for a specific role
so they can see and read messages
But i have to do that in every game of that queue
no, go to your queue channel, the one where you join the queue and set it
it will be permanent
Oh so whats the point of /spectator role add
If that is here
im not sure
has something to do with the vcs
guys when the support role
Oh ok
im not staff here btw
I know
Thanks for the help tho
I appreciate it
Can you create a rank queue system for matchmaking?
`/autoroles mmr set`
Oh I mean like certain ranks can queue up in a category/channel separately from other ranks
You combine that command with /rolerequirement
So in a queue you will have a rolerequirement of bronze, another queue the rolerequirement of gold
Thats so big brain thank you
Would the MMR be global still if we separate it like that?
only if all your stats are linked between queues

Thats beautiful thank you
what will happen with the premium set up when premium runs out?
will those reset? or do i get them back if i pay again?
it will end any additional queues to get you back down to 3
but it will save the config code which you can reuse
any existing queues which are not ended will have a config saved before removing premium stuff
Hello. I have EU and NA roles set up. I just need a way to have it so that this message counts the number of NA and EU roles, and whoever has more than 6, gets to play the pug on their server. Is this possible?
its a 5v5 pug system
no that is not possible currently
its a very specific requirement, i dont see how it could be implemented
I want when the number of participants in Scrim starts to be 10/10, the bot will choose an automatic ROM for us and a random 5v5 team. How do I do that?
ROM ?
Rom in Crossfire game
<@145305657237700608>
im not sure what that means
if you want to randomly pick something, use either /votingmenu or /lobbydetails set
-d lobbydetails set
<@145305657237700608>
What do I write in these boxes?
please answer
What do I write in title ÿü
just use lobby details
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=lobbydetails-set
it has an example of picking some random data
<@145305657237700608>
I just want you to tell me what to write in these boxes. I don't want anything else
Pick what u want lol
There isn't 1 right way
i cant tell you what to put cuz i dont know what you want
You dont have to fill everything out btw, not every option is required.
<@145305657237700608> is there a command to disable allowing subsitutes unless from admins? theres skill based queues and people are able to sub people without the role into a game
-d readyup replaceinactive toggle
its not the automatic one, its the user based one <@145305657237700608>
./substitute
oh, you can just disable the command in the server integration settings
hi is there a way to disable the cancel game function for like ''regular'' players? so like admin and mods can only start a cancel vote?
how do i make a veto system
Whsts veto
You can disable that via server integration
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> like map ban? saying no to a certain map after voting for modes?
i dont have choose maps available atm. only choose modes until the update is done for the map order
also for some reason i cant connect this specific queue to my server stats.. it has its own
Theres /map ban
<@648635725964902411> thank you, also I'm having such a hard time fixing a queue to be added to the existing server stats
Its its own thing for some reason and I'm so reluctant yo push forward bc I think everything will break
<@145305657237700608> at the reset stats (/managestats reset all ) the role that start with some mmr, restart with that mmr?
No, the autorole setup won't change, but yes the mmr for every player will reset
I did /manage stats reset and only have a few members in the system  and its saying i still have to buy premium

Hey everyone. Is there a way to check which maps/modes are currently in my server? I'm adjusting stuff for the first time in a while and don't want to start from scratch
How many queues you have
1v1 and 5v5 I reset the correct one
Did you use `/managestats reset all` ? And the desired queue?
Thats weird
Even if you type in the pop up?
`confirm`
I mean I bought the base premium that‚Äôs all I can afford im poor and I don‚Äôt need any of the other features
Is there not any other fix
Ive done this several times before now it‚Äôs just not working
Thats weird
Can u i invite me to the server
mhm soap
Yeah I‚Äôll dm it to u
The premium is now based on unique monthly users, the error message is showing incorrectly
What‚Äôs happens when I get this
How do you get a premium plan
Go to the neatqueue Website, to dashboard, manage your server, choose on of the 3 plans
WAIT HE LEFT THE SERVER I WROTE THIS FOR NOTHING
Yea idk wasn‚Äôt the link to premium literally in that message
yep lmao

If you have a leaderboard reseting every month... is there a way to manually update individuals' All-Time stats?
how do i add a leaderboard
i setup neatqueue but not sure how to add a leaderboard :*(
-d leadearboard

isn't that delete leaderboard üòÆ
What do you mean
how do i add a leaderboard of the queue?
I just showed u
Do /leaderboard

Hey there! I was wondering if there is an option to disable different modes of teammaking. In the server we have the bot in we have ground rules that you must always choose the option random because at the end of the day that is the fairest for us. Any way to disable the other teammaking options?
-d teamselection set
thank, will try it out
will this be for every new game? Or do i need to do it at every new q
only when you create a new queue in a channel via /setup or /startqueue
okay thank you
and (stupid questions) but what is the way to re-enable all different modes of teamselection?
Re run the command and select all of them again
When using the ``/tournament startmatches`` command, does it start any matches that are currently set to "In Progress"? I want to be able to start the matches one by one sequentially rather than all at once, and am wondering how it chooses to start them currently. I notice that when I run the command, it sets the temporary channels up, and then sets the matches to "In Progress" on challonge.
No that won't work
it will only skip matches that are complete OR currently active in discord
gotcha
Unable to create channels due to discord rate limiting. Please try again later! , It's been this warning for 24 hours now.
getting a lot of "this interaction failed", this is happening nearly any time any button is hit
I'm assuming it's related to the rate limiting thing above
try again now
bot was restarting
is that to fix it?
ok great, thanks
let me know next time it happens
been trying to track the cause down
thank you
Hi I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly
For the command /leaderboardconfig sharedstats set, I'm not sure how to check what I set it to specifically
I want two gamemode queues to have a shared MMR while having a third gamemode queue to have a separate MMR from the other two
I think I did it right, but I'd like to check if I set both of them to a certain sharedstat
<@145305657237700608> whats the difference between /spectator role and /tempchannels permissions ?
you can check in /info
the shared stats setting
spectator role is kinda like a "preset" which lets that role get access to channels
you could achieve the same by changing the permissions
Ok thanks
Is there the possibility to give a staff role only perms that i set? And not every perm for the bot?
found it nvm.
I noticed that some people's ranks aren't getting updated via their MMR. Is there a command to update their ranks or do I have to manually change their roles
Is the neatqueue role higher than your ranks?
Mh ok, go run /autoroles refresh and lmk what's happening
"This server is only allowed 3 different queues. Let the server staff know to upgrade to premium to allow more queues!" 
I get this error even tho I only have 1 queue
Run /end queue and check if u actually have just 1
I did that and it ended the queue i had setup. the problem is i think that when trying to set up the q I had issues with it so I delted the channel and tried again. im thinking that there still is a queue activated yet the channel is deleted. is there a way to fix that
`/endqueue` should end it
I cant end the q in the deleted channels cause they dont exist
are you sure? if yes i got no idea how to fix that, you can wait for neatz im sorry
its fine. and yeah its weird i thought kicking the bot and then reinviting would work but it didnt
use /serverstats info
it will show all the queues at the bottom
btw the bot doesn't do anything when kicked, doesn't delete any data or anything
so yeah i have these 2 unknown channels
is there a way to remove them then
check now?
yoo it works now thx
How tf
If I leave a server with the bot on it, and i have a certain amount of mmr, is the mmr lost when i leave
So its reset after I rejoin
No it won't reset
how do I make it so the elo shows up on a players name
-d ratinginname toggle
how do I make it apply to all
immediately
You need them to queue
Hello I accidentally ended the queue after setting it up and it looks like my setup got cleared
Is there a way to recover it, or do I have to redo the setup all over again for the queue system? (I used the /endqueue and /startqueue commands)
When u did endqueue it shouldve drop a code
You can load it again
`/config load`
I've never seen a code
I'm unsure what to do
Do /config list
The last code should be it
thank you so much
you're super big brain
<:sobs:1215418514089971763>
<:PeepoHeart:1171269076971180042>
am i able to manual update every player mmr after match?
you can use either `/add mmr` or `/set mmr`
Hello, I have a bot configured and when players on my server play matching games with MMR difference it doesn't match or takes too long, is there any way to eliminate that delay and they can match together even if they have MMR difference?
change your /queuetype to PUGs and it will instantly create a match
Ty so much
Wouldn't that affect people's statistics?
only in the sense that people might have more unfair matches
Oh sorry I didn't explain well, I meant if the stats already achieved are reset or something like that.
no that wont be changed at all
Anyway to time someone out?
You can ban them manually and put x seconds
Were can i see how big a party can be?
Is there any command or info i can see that?
tf are points
someone got banned from queue and lost points lol
Points are points
Its use is limited i think so
Like, not much options with it
What do they do?
Just beeing points?
Yeah, points that u earn from winning games
That's mmr not?
Mmr is different
But they can work the same in a way
With points u can have an entry price for a queue
I didn't set anything up for this
Then someone set it up idk
Ty I guess
I have a problem
<@1194079999846793248>

We cant read ‚ù§Ô∏è
Currently the only way to confirm that you are present at a match is by joining a vc, is there a way to make it clicking a present button instead of joining the vc?
`/queueentry methods`
No that‚Äôs how you join the queue, I‚Äôm wondering if there is a way to make it a button when accepting the match. Btw it‚Äôs for a team vs team if that helps
Oh yeah i confused commands `/readyup mode`
Thank you very much man
need some mission critical help atm
players not joining their created queue channel is holding up games, timeout is currently 5 minutes
what is the command to lower that time limit
lobbychannel timer?
So this is for a queue that is 8mans, random 8 players queue up and select captain's, then capts select players: The queue wouldn't let captains select players. Now its broken, and cannot reset just says only 3 different queues allowed. I've tried canceling that que, and going back to finding queues that were active and cancel those.
Why cant captains pick?
If a match broke, there is nothing you can do to fix, just requeue and try again
Players cannot requeue the buttons have disappeared. May i send a photo of what it looks like
So, after captains are chosen, they are supposed to be able to choose then after they choose. Thats when a new queue can be started, but the capts cant select so the new one never pops up and trying to restart the queue manually just pops up with "This server is only allowed 3 different queues. Let the server staff know to upgrade to premium to allow more queues!"
Sure send a pic, im not following
are you able to hop in a call? kind of hard to show in screenshots but i can try
just send them in the forum post you made
added. tried not to make confusing but like i said with screenshots kind of hard
Is it possible if there are 10 people in the queue, and there are 2 teams of 2 players, that they wont be in the same team?
Hey. Our solo player queue is working perfectly. But we would like to setup a team queue for teams to find scrims
Is there a way for the leaderboard of the team queue to have the name of the team/party? instead of the party leader's discord name? To keep track of the results
We talked about this this past weekend (link here: <https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/857677776471588894/1244051625610444800>), but I'd like to bring it up again.

One thing you mentioned was this:
> that queue embed is hacked together to show a large number of characters
> but the captains embed is not the same type
> i can try and see if swapping just works, when are you starting it?

So is there a way a special draft mode could be made that takes advantage of multiple embeds, or something similar? We would love to use the bot for our draft tournaments instead of an Excel sheet, but I also understand that there's going to be a limit to things. I'm mainly wanting to pick your brain and hopefully come up with something.

If you would like me to put this in feature requests instead, I can. Maybe request something like "Make a draft type that doesn't have a character limit"?
** **

Also (and this will probably be much easier to answer), we have been manually resetting all stats at the end of the month. I just realized that there are monthly stats. If we go to monthly stats, once the stats reset, can we go back and see the previous month's stats? I'm assuming it's not retroactive, but we reward the top players at the end of the month, so being able to see the final standings at the end of the month, post-reset, would be needed if we did the monthly stats.
How do I reset everybody's MMR in one and/or all leaderboards?
`/managestats reset all`
This will reset mmr, streaks, games played, etc.
Would it be possible to not have games played removed?
Also, is there a command to set everybody's MMR to a certain amount?
If everyone has a certain role, you could use:
`/set mmr mmr:0 role:`
Oh so if they have a certain role such as *Member*, it would set their starting MMR as 1000 (if set as 1000)?
Yes, but that would *technically* be
`/startingmmr set mmr:1000 role:Member`

However, idk how that would affect people who already have mmr. I don't *think* it would reset it, but if you reset the stats and someone plays a queue, they would for sure start with 1,000.

As for the `/set mmr` command, idk how that affects people who leave the server and come back. For instance, if someone leaves and comes back and a reset hasn't occurred, I'm pretty sure their mmr will go back to normal. If a reset had happened, it won't.

So idk what happens if someone leaves the server, the role they used to have is set to 0, and they come back.

That's technically above my pay grade lol. I'm just a guy in Best Buy who happens to be wearing a blue shirt üòÇ
Ahh thank you so much for the information
Really clarified in a lot of things
NeatZ could roll in and say I'm completely wrong, but I'm fairly certain I'm right on the first 2 paragraphs...?
yup sounds right to me, thx
Yea i mean sending multiple embeds would be 1 solution, ill try and find time to take a look
not currently
The parties might be on the same team, depends how teams are picked
Bumping this since there was a lot
ah lol
Yea you can enable monthly stats, it adds an extra tab to the leaderboard which lets you filter by month
It works best if you enable it right when the new month starts
Awesome. Thanks!
I noticed you out an X under the AI support saying that it resets at 2am UTC. Is that wrong?
Nevermind. I just found the thread clarifying it:
<https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/1131752660740083763/1234945077516959875>
yea somehow the AI was just incredibly wrong
Hi for some reason we set the role to a certain MMR (999), but it hasn't changed the MMR amount for everybody. It keeps giving them 1250
check your /info and look at the starting MMR
you probably have a higher starting MMR for some role they have
Would have a problem. My players can join into a temp created queue even if they are not allowed to join there. Is there any "fix" for it?
It would depend on the permissions you have set up
Is it the voice channel? Do they have a staff/spectator role? Does your category grant access to all voice channels? etc
I think there are just too many issues
sure the captains embed could be fixed, but then basically any embed whichs shows teams/players would have to be fixed
And yes it is the voice channel and they have normal player and can still join.
you'll have to check the perms, by default a voice channel will inherit perms of the category + deny @ everyone joining + allow all players to join
Maybe found the issue thanks!

Is there btw anyway to move players instantly into the queues when they are in different voice channels and found a match?
-d lobbychannel pullall
thanks!
I understand. Thank you for trying!
Having some issues, The queue I had set up in my server randomly dissapeared last night when I sent a message in the channel. I ended the queue and tried to start a new one in the server, butt whenever i do /startqueue or /setup the bot responds with either "(Name) Queue has been started!" or "Starting Queue setup, and then gives me no further options beyond that
Thanks in advance for the help!
the bot probably doesn't have permissions to send messages
It definitely sends messages, it just doesnt give me further options
Let me send a ss
(It gave me nothing after it said "starting queue steup!")
a reply to a command doesn't actually need permissions to send messages
so that doesn't indicate if  the bot has perms
Oh interesting, I'll have a look
Just checked, the neatqueue role has permission to send messages and the channel im asking it to do stuff in all have permissions for @ everyone to send messages
if you impersonate the role, are you able to see the channel + send messages?
i try'd to set it up on a bigger server but only with admin permissions its vreating the vioce channels after you found  game in the queue
do you know which permissions i need for the bot to make it work?
It needs the manage channels permission as it says in that error message üôÇ
it has the permisions already
but its still not working ... thats the thing tho

The bot has this role, this role has all permissions toggled on. in both the category and the channel
Did you add the bot role to the category/channel? If so, try adding the bot itself
Yes, also not working.
If you want I can invite you so you can see the server permissions if that would help.
can you try adding the bot itself instead of the bot's role?
just tried
NeatZ, did you have any further recommendations for steps I could take? no rush to respond
The queue does seem to work when I give the bot admin permissions, but I don't really want to do that
I have 2 queues currently 
- 8s Cross play in one channel
- 8s PC in another channel

Results for both queues are being put in the first channel

How do I put results for 2nd queue in the 2nd channel?

Ok so I'm going into the 2nd queue channel and using that command to set it to that same channel, but the results still keep being posted in the first channel we set up the first queue in
screenshot?
made some annotations to help visualize
Is thee an issue going on in Neatqueue currently? I can't seem to interact with any of buttons
some of those are the staff channel messages
-d staffchannel set
same, it just randomly died
yep node 1 died
its back
ty I think that was it!
Thank youuuuu

Check if embed links are enabled
One of my queues is set to create a new category. (During testing) When the match is done, the category is not deleted. Is there something I'm missing to let neatqueue delete the category when match is done? It's currently an Admin so it shouldn't be a permission issue.
Amazing, thanks
I think it doesnt delete it
Been a while since i tested that
This is interesting, on my mobile app I see the empty leftover Queue-xxx category, on desktop I don't see the category. My bot hasn't logged that the Queue-xxx category was deleted.
mobile discord is buggy
Ah yeah
I just tested it on mobile that time, so it might be that
I didnt know discord mobile was that bs
Makes sense now
It can happens with channels aswell
oh nvm, i found the Queue category in a different order on desktop
NeatQueue is not deleting the match categories
but yeah Discord mobile, very bad experience, just as bad as Twitch mobile
Any ideas for my issue?
Check the integrations in settings. You can change the permissions there as well
<@415301114817413133>
Maybe check the category perms? I couldn't tell if the previous screenshots were from the category or the queue channel
The channel is synced to the category
What about the role itself in the server settings, not just in the channel?
-d teamnames
Idk. I don't mind joining your server and taking a look if you want, but I can't promise anything. It looks like you have everything right
The only other thing you could try is this, maybe?
`/tempchannels permissions set role:@NeatQueue permission:Manage Channels value:Allow`
<@145305657237700608> for /forcestart config i have the auto_start on but it doesnt do anything
it does this after we found a queue
neatqueue is not deleting categories when new category setting is toggled on
I just wanted to clarify, but if I run this code at 12:01 am June 1st, will it immediately start a new month, or what? I'm wondering when the best time to do it would be. We usually screenshot the stats then manually reset, so if the leaderboard will do it, we won't have to do those extra steps.

The code:
`/leaderboardconfig monthly toggle:Enabled mode:Reset`
Yes, when u run that command it will take that moment as a new month
is that mobile or desktop? Does desktop show the same issue?
Desktop shows same issue
alright ill check thx
this is what happens when I try to create a queue
but that's how I want it to be.
Can you help me how to do it?

Question
So if you already join a q and it creates the teams vc channels are you able to limit the amount of people in said vc channels?
Like 4v4 to prevent others from joining the vc
`/roles`
Yes thats by default
Its limited to the teamsize
Unless you disabled channel restrictions, or have a staff role or spect role
My moderators can not see the temporary channels made for the queues how do I enable this for them
`/tempchannels permissions set`
I set team sizes to 4 for 4v4 but need team channel sizes to be 5. Is that possible?
Nope
You can add a special role that can join the channel if u want so
how to fix que not starting when its full
Thats a matchmaking queue
So it will search for players that their mmr is close to eachother and then if there are 10 of them it will start
So you might want PUGs
`/queuetype`
Hey man!
where can i find the docs for mmr change variance
<@145305657237700608> can you help with this?
Can I stop the voice chats created from being above my own voice channel can they be created below
Sure I can pass you an invite see if you see anything I missed. Sorry for delay.
-d mmr change variance
theres no way to customize the position, no
its supposed to take a few minutes to pop up
1 more thing
how can i set up an auto demotion
is there a way to change the time
So how do I change the category each queue channel pops in
`/channel category`
Uhm have a problem rn. I set the result channel but he is constantly writting it in my queue channel. Can someone help me with that pls?
nvm fixed it -.-
<:heyge:1171268369572446288>

Hello!
I am trying to see if I can change the Team Captains to high elo, I see a /captainselection but no way to set it
Nevermind that
Is neat queue down?
Emptying queue due to 2 minutes of inactivity
how do i extend this
Could you help with this?
bots down?
same issue
<@145305657237700608> bot seems offline
i see the bot is trying to restart himself :/
Yeah i had the same issue lol
Does anyone know how to purchase premium? I can‚Äôt find the link anywhere

then you can buy the credit

Ahh was gonna say something but it seems bots are down for most channels
the ai said it was 10 now 20min da fuq
Servers down?
Back soon?
no info
Is it possible to have 2 different leaderboards of Neat Queue for different games?
In the same server
set two different queue
than you can have two differendt leaderboards
Leaderboards are down for me
yeah it's down for me as well
But I didn't refresh
bot still dead
Be patience guys. Im pretty sure they are fixing their database. And bot will be reboot in any sec
We back?
50/50
we started a queue locally but we have some issue
Dont ask the AI nothing about when the bots down or when it will come back, it doesnt know, its just straight up hallucinating lmao
Can we ask you so üòÇ
someone is working on issue?
DB problem?
Only NeatZ knows, and on the page u can see the status of the nodes

How does one get mod here lol
Helping
And random picked then?
does anyone know if there is a way for the bot to ping more than one role when using the /autoping feature
Wdym?
<:Deadge:981720369184530532>
I dont think its possible as i can see, i might be wrong
damn alright, thanks for the help
Which permission would be for match result editing like "tie, revert/cancel, Team1, team2"?
Without giving them perms for adding mmr as example.
you can use /staffrole
-d staffrole command allow
yeah ik but what is the command for that?
For the results i mean.
<@145305657237700608> could you help with this please
-d /outcome
no theres no way to change the forcestart timer
How long is the timer?
thanks.
iirc 3 minutes
hey, im running valorant pugs 10mans with captains pick. theres 2 players who may only play in the same team, will joining queue as a party keep them together for captains pick?
cuz my draft pick is set to straight (1-1-1-1)
Dont think so
is there a way they can be a package deal when it comes to draft
cause party is supposed to keep em together right
if i change teamselection from captains to something else mby?
any people in parties will always end up on the same team
so even if theres 10 players, 2 teams, 1 pick each. if captain picks one of them, they both get automatically in?
yes, it won‚Äôt display the players separate, just the entire party
ure right, i just saw it
thank u!!
When you tap the "Show My Stats" button, the red part show the all-time stats, but the green part shows the current month stats. Is there a way to get this to only show the current month stats?
The only way you can show monthly stats would be if u have monthly leaderboard activated
I dont think theres any other option
Okay. Thanks!
Would I be right to assume that the auto roles are tied to the monthly mmr?
correct
Awesome. They can deal with the stats button showing the all-time stats then
yea perhaps that should be a setting
for what the button shows by default
Hi, im trying t oget this set up in a server. i aded it but it says managechannels needs permissions but when i go into the settings, it does have the permission

how can i auto delete the queue vc and channel after the match?
Thats automatic
Does anyone know if I can have the bot select 6 maps from a pool of maps to be voted on? Like I enter 20 map names, but when a queue pops neatqueue gives the players 6 to vote on
Is there a way to ‚Äûbalance‚Äú the MMR system more effectively? My queues are looking like this atm even if i adjust the ranges it‚Äôs still pretty unbalanced.
Yes with /map add etc you can add maps there players can pick and ban it.
Yeah but that allows players to vote on every map I add. I have to manually remove and add maps every queue to get 6 random ones
Mine did the same thing. I had to give it admin perms
Mathmaking
`/queuetype`
That‚Äôs not what i meant. I have matchmaking as my queue but the players who playing against each other having huge MMR differences
How are teams selected?
Random
Then you must try `balanced`
But it would have the same effect like random so you don‚Äôt need to vote etc ?
And does it affect party‚Äôs as well?
no voting is required
and yes parties will work as well
thanks !
Hi! How can I create a queue without requirement to join a voice channel after? I just want a simple queue for games and just a thread to talk/setup games
`/readyup mode` you can change it to clicking a button or just to none
how can I reset leaderboard
Can I disable messages to choose team etc on lobby creation after queue is full and thread created? I just want to create blank lobby thread with @ping users without any info about team/drat/etc
``/managestats reset all ``
its should reset just the leaderboard
the leaerboard shows the stats -.-
How do I get rid of the menu for picking whether to vote for captains or do it randomlly
and justh ave it automatically go to the select captains thing
``/teamselection set``
how can i set up
help
/setup
yeah i know but whats the next
step
thats the basic setup
then you can do whatever you want
<:Cat:1236131132064665650>
Can I disable by default messages to choose team etc on lobby creation after queue is full and thread created? I just want to create blank lobby thread with @ping users without any info about team/drat/etc
Not really, but you could extend the lobby's timer to longer
The only thing is that if the time is over it will kick everyone or the matchcleanup aswell
And to end the "match" youll need to /cancel every time u youre done
I do not want to extend the time, I just want "blank" lobby without messages
Yeah but thats not possible, in order to do that youll need to extend the timer
yea it will always have to show info about the lobby/match
Just coming in here to double check before we wipe our queue, is /managestats reset all the correct command to basically reset the current leaderboard?
That resets all the stats of players about that queue, leaderboard its the visual representation of the stats saved on the queue, so youre resetting the queue, not the leadearboard, so yeah, that basically resets every stat to default
Thank you!
I have seen on some discords that they do not show teamtype etc and just ping with users
if its just 1 team `/numberofteams 1` it won't show any team info cuz there are no teams
but otherwise if there are teams it will always show the teams
Is there a command to give all players a certain amount of MMR?
`/set mmr`
heello
I am new to this bot I was wondering if someone could show me how to match players to their account/mmr
I mean add a certain amount of MMR to the current players
`/add mmr`
I just added the bot and it won‚Äôt let me setup
Does reshuffling map on random pick work? I already set the number of possible reshuffles using `/map reshuffle` command, but I don't see a button to reshuffle map or anything after map selection.
make sure the bot has permissions in the channel
make sure your `/map selection` is Random
hey guys
recently i made a server running up your bot for lobby
when que is full and want to make the lobby
it forces to join vc
which something i dont want
what is the command to cancel it ?
<@145305657237700608> üòÖ‚ù§Ô∏è
``/readyup mode`` and choose button or nothing
Not the vc one
yea tru now i remember it

What is the difference between mmrpenalty and pointspenalty ?
is the bto down?
No its not
~~is there a way to disable the creation of the team voice channels and make it so you can choose the winner without joining the voice~~
Is there a way to have an option when people join in queue, they can vote to play for a certain gamemode, just like how they can vote for captains?
did it work for you?
works?
`/gamemode selection` might be what you're looking for
What does that do
Mmr is what you would earn or lose for a match you queue up in.

Points is used for making bets with the bot and other users.
It let's you select the gamemode
I worded that wrong
I‚Äôm looking for a bot that can make private matches in the game ‚Äúthe finals‚Äù can anyone tell me if this bot would work for that?
It let's you choose how gamemodes are chosen, similar to how you choose the captains.
I honestly have no idea what that game is, but if you're able to create private matches or have your own server inside the game, then you should be able to use the bot. You can have captains make their teams and queue up that way, you can have people join in as individuals with an option to choose a role or not, and more. It's a pretty freaking awesome bot
You are able to create private matches in the game, how would the bot be able to do that though?
With no former knowledge on your game, I'm going to be hypothetical and say it's 5v5 with no designated roles.

You create a lobby with 2 teams, 5 players each. You can set multiple different variables within this. Some people use matchmaking, where it won't let you play with someone who has a ranking too far away from yours. Others (like myself) have a straight fill system that will start as soon as enough people to fill both teams starts up.

You can set captains by a vote, random, or even no captains and let the bot split the teams by their ranking, randomly, etc.

The bot makes the teams, the teams decide how to play each other in-game, and they vote on the winner.

There's a lot more to it than that, but I feel like that's the basic gist from my experience with it.
The bot doesn't control the game. I use mine for FIFA. We have to start the friendly match ourselves in-game once teams are drafted by the captains. We have it to where the captains pick what team you play on and stuff.
This is used for games like CoD, Overwatch, and more. I'm certain it'll work for you.
Yea, the bot doesn't interacts with specific games at all since it works more generally for all games
cant do anything in the game itself
hey there, had a quick question. why doesnt the bot drag the ps5 players connected in the vc even after having appropriate perms and all?
pls mention me if somebody replies. thank you
Hmm it does sound a problem with discord app in ps5
if there is any issue between versions of discord there is not much I can do
Hello, I have a "THE FINALS" queue where 4 teams join and they go into a map ban and then into a specialization (hero) ban. I was wondering if there was a way to make it so teams cannot see what other teams are in queue or if there was a way to randomize ban order. 

Right now how it works is that the first team that joins the queue gets first map ban and first hero ban with the last team getting last map ban and last hero ban respectively. 

I want to avoid scenarios where teams will try to be the last team in order to gain a ban advantage.
there isn't really any way to hide who a team is playing against
how do i remove the vc limit
on teams
so people can spectate
disable `/channel restrictions`, or add a `/spectatorrole`
also damn, everyone got negative MMR
üò≠ the 169 guy trolled picks
Anyone set up for Fifa/FC ?
disabling channel restrictions is letting people talk when they arent in the game, and when i did spectator roles they couldnt join because of channel limit
is there any way to show peak mmr in /stats
adding a spectator role should remove  the channel limits
<@145305657237700608> what is the way i can limit the players with low mmr from playing with players of high mmr. e.g. Players within more than 2500 MMR appart cannot play with oneanother
nvm i forgot there is AI support
sorry for the ping
is there a command to not inherit permissions from the parent category?
is there a command to manually change player's mmr?
either /set mmr or /add mmr
Trying to get premium neatbot
But it's not working.
Buttons on the website won't press it
how to overcome the issue then?
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The highest MMR should be 105 but its 200 because of me fidgeting with people's mmrs when I was setting up my server
Everything resets to 100 mmr whenever a new month rolls around so in that All Time Stats dropdown, there is a section for May & June stats
We've been noticing a lot of "Interaction Failed" messages lately when trying to use a button with the bot.  It's either when readying up, joining/leaving queue, or even voting for captains. Is this a known thing? If not, now you know about it lol
^

Just happened for me too, though it fixed itself when I clicked it again/a 3rd time
Yeah, it usually fixes itself, but it's just been happening a lot recently
bot is kinda laggy today
How can i remove mmr from a player like as example: Player A has 2000 mmr i want to remove 60
`/add mmr`, but with negative value
ah okay so /add mmr -60 ?
alright thanks
im having this thing, when a queue ends. another Queue join Box doesnt appear automatic
<@648635725964902411>
I think youre confusing it
a queue is one time setup, and its the entry point
when u create a queue, you dont need to end it, or start it over and over again, it just stays
everytime it hits the desired size it will create a match
so basically imagine the queue that you create as the entry point that create games
and its like that
ooooooo thanks
<@648635725964902411>  is the host for neatqueue like bad since it went offline?
i've been noticing that myself and alot others have been getting "interaction failed" when it comes to commands or jus joining/leaving the queue
since the bot went offline like 3 days ago i think
could be longer
Node 2 seems offline
Maybe theres something taking too much cpu idk
Hello, I have a question... so that 2 queues with different names and different MMR go to a single leaderboard, how can I do it?
how can i raise the queue size from 0/10 to 0/12? <@648635725964902411>
`/teamsize`
Youll need to end them one by one with /endqueue
What happens when it says Error fetching your Rainbow 6 rating. Make sure the account is formatted correctly! What does this mean <@145305657237700608>
Is there a way to turn off auto ties?

Why do I have a delay despite my pro subscription?
what delay?
use /serverstats info
and it will show where you have queues
<@145305657237700608>
Auto ties?
I can only see that happening when the match timer is over and no one selected a winner
does it show any queues?
Hi sry 
When entering the queue or sending a command
there is no added delay, any delay is just the bot operating
yeah how can this get turned off
-d timer matchcleanup
is there a command to make it so only the 2 captains can vote for select winner?
Are there any problems selecting premium plan? I have enough credits for lowest tier but can‚Äôt click ‚Äûselect‚Äù button.
you probably have it already?
that‚Äôs the only reason it wouldn‚Äôt be selectable

Currently having an issue getting MMR to register correctly for VALORANT. it was working fine until recently but now it's resetting people down a few hundred mmr from where they were previously and when re-registerring it's placing them *much* further down (1800 -> 242), wonderinf if there's a way to fix it or a setting I had on erroneously. I just reset the queue entirely as well since people had joined into it months ago and improved drastically outside of queues since then, but I have basically nothing on outside of default settings and require register for valorant and it's still happening
Im not sure if I have a specific bug but no one in my discord is able to use the /forcestart command anymore and I set a /staffrole add command for some of my players to try and forcestart but they're still not able to do so.
<@145305657237700608> If i do "/managestats reset all" people that have role with "/startingmmr set" riceve mmr
Is there a way to disable certain commands from regular players?
such as /player sub ?
what happens?
if they requeue they would get a starting MMR again
that is an admin command, but you can disable commands via the server's integration settings
they try to do the /forcestart command in the q channel and the drop down doesnt pop up and they cant use the command
do you want me to inv you to the server? Maybe im missing something
is it just that command, or all commands dont pop up in that channel?
perhaps you disabled the application commands permission
im braindead
you we're right. I didnt have the application commands ticked for their role in the text chat
cheers
lol, sounds good
Apparently regular users can use it which is odd
did you assign a staff role to everyone?
normal players can use
-d substitute
where the other player must accept the sub
Is there a log stored for the messages sent in the temp channels?
Theres a functionality that will generate a temporal transcript of the channel, it is sent to the `/staffchannel`
Can I get a response to this <:gx_prayge:844587651288924181>
got it bugging out on me in a few servers identically
So i created a queue named 5v5 for lol, then i created another one for cs called cs, when i tested the cs it added mmr to the 5v5 leaderboard(it shouldnt asell because is test queue right?) but as i understood both queues are connect to the same leaderboard
how can i fix it so different queues have different mmr leaderboards?
Is there a way to disable this specific command?
when you say re-registering, what do you mean?

yes via the server integration settings
typing the /register command with account registration required for the queue. It's set up for VAL, queue requires registration, type in the command, and it pulls the wrong mmr even on a fresh queue we haven't been previously registered on
Where can I find the server integration settings?
s√≥ i did /leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide Disabled and /leaderboardconfig sharedstats set 5v5 and it reseted 5v5 leaderboard
any help?

you will have to set the existing queue sharedstats to be player_stats

it should pop up automatically

Wait so
<@145305657237700608>
I have to name
Like
the queues the same way
that would be option 3
option 1 is the easiest way
Well there is one queue that I do not want to be ranked
yea then option 2 or 3
<:heyge:1171268369572446288>
So I have 3 queues

Two are ranked one is casual..

So if I change the two ranked queue names to..

6v6 Ranked Queue
6v6 Ranked Queue

and leave the other one as

8v8 Ranked Queue

then the two ranked ones will share the same MMR, stats, and be essentially synced together?

Is there a way that for overwatch the bot can also pick your role for you, and base that off of MMR? I tried with the AI bot to get an answer, but I am not 100% sure it understands what I want. 

Essentially, can there be a Tank, DPS, Support role, each with their different MMR based on your placements from playing that role in the past
Nope
If you mean role in game nope
What about setting the bot up for having different MMR for different games
yes, if you have multiple queues for different games

ohh so it includes private channels too
alright I'll try it
Nvm
i'll just give it admin
I've set serverwide staffchannel to a channel only visible to mods and NeatQueue, but all queue staffresults are being put into the first channel I created a queue in. NeatQueue has admin privilege. Why is the staffchannel not changing?
Hii, when my games are fininsh and everybody voted its not gong in my queue result chat/page how do i link it that it goes straight to the queue result channel after the gamr
How to get a Transcript
and in the channel of the queue i set it up to link but still not going to the channel after the game
There is a channel transcript link in your queue logs for every queue
that is the command for the results, maybe you are seeing the staff channel results?
-d staffchannel set
How to disable the private voice/chat that the bot creates?
You mean disable the channels it create or disable the private of it

`/channel restrictions`
is there anyway to create a team-based queue? for example, i create a team called "asd" and that team gains mmr in a leaderboard
so if there is a queue going and there is before the game 1 player queueing, i want to set a priority to the people who played last game. So i setted "/requeue priority 1 300" however if someone does this, if the queue has enough players it will start automatically and the priority wont have effect, is there a delay setting so queue waits until for this example for 300 seconds and when there are 11 players in the queue, it will give priority to the last game players?
is there a way to adjust how mmr changes so players get less for beating players with lower mmr and lose more when losing to players with lower mmr?

i noticed that it was doing the opposite (e.g. player with 2000 got more mmr from beating someone with 1500)
Dang that's a cool idea
Maybe post it in the feature requests?
<a:funfunfun:1220931673441439845>
any1 know how to make lets say a private queue
that others would have to have a special role to see (the calls the bot makes) or even just only the people in queue can see that call
Hello
The queue bot will not stay on the bottom of the queue anymore how would I got about fixing this?
I know the bot isn't down according to <#992610856904957992> , but is it down in another way? The queue message isn't sticky, and this message keeps popping up when the queue fills up, even though there definitely aren't too many channels.
restarting now, sometimes the bot gets a bit confused
<a:AM_ThumbsUp:998965078391013497>
That worked. Thanks!
Is there a reason why the bot keeps crashing recentely? (This interaction failed)
Can be too many factors, but it shouldnt be a problem at all
What bottom?
Du you mean the channel and its queue embed message?
its all good now, sometimes the messages stop sticking to the bottom
Is there a way to change the channel name for the VC that gets created?

How do I get the bot to ping a role when someone uses /need
<@145305657237700608> what would be the reason there are 2 queues within the same channel?
Twas fine like 30 minutes ago, now identical queues showed up <:majwhatda:1209555777564581961>
Theres no way there are two queues in the same channel
Tis the same channel
The same people can join both at the same time
Its the same queue, maybe it just got bugged, if u delete one of the messages you fix it
That won't mess with anything?
Nope
yea each channel can only have 1 queue
sometimes if a bunch of people are messaging then an old message can stay there
Oki so deleting one message won't mess with the original queue?
nope
If you delete one, neatqueue should just rersend the message later
What permissions do i need to use the ADMINONLY commands
I want to make a staff for my server so they can use ban from queue commands or decrease elo etc. but they cant even see the /leaderboard command.
Administrator
or configure admin roles
not quite sure
try /staffrole and let me know
yeah it doesnt work
and the bad thing is
we cant do anything abt it
i tried every permission and it just doesnt work
why can‚Äôt they use commands? what does it say

Any plans to implement this? Would like to be able to schedule a lock/unlock sun-wed, but remain locked until the upcoming sunday.
the comments doesnt show up like when u type "/" usually all the commands showup right?
but no one can see the commands and cant use them
that would be your ‚Äúuse application commands‚Äù permission
you must have it disabled across the server/channel/role
not currently

Hello üëã . Very basic question. Can each queue have its own MMR rating / leaderboard tied to it?
yes, depending on
<@857633321064595466> stats

Thanks for the fast answer. I'm trying to avoid a "global" MMR rating that's shared accross different games. So since I'd want to create, let's say, 5 different queues for 5 different board games with each game having its own MMR stats, then I would have to use the option (2) above in each of the 5 different channels I create, making sure that, after I use option (2)'s command, to name them differently?
How many queue's / leaderboards come free with the bot? And is there a max player limit to any queue?
In House queue bot limits 500 per leaderboard seems like.
You can either use option 2 or 3, 3 being the simpler way
And from what I can see in their support server, doesnt have the capability to even do separate leaderboard
NeatQueue is a bit different, the free limit is 200 players monthly + 3 different queue channels
What happens when someone tries to join a queue but the max has been hit?
Does it "break" queues or does the person joining just get denied in some way
they get denied from joining
also, 200 players means 200 people actually playing a match, not just queuing
So kind of like the max being: having 50 games of 4 players in each game, per month... or would it be more like 50 games of 4 **unique** players that haven't played a match yet in a certain month. I guess I'm confused when the bot will actually deny someone. Will it be after that 50th game is over then literally noone can queue for a match?
200 unique players for the month
the 50 game limit is per day
So after that 200th unique player plays a game then the bot will deny any more commands for queueing
for any additional unique player
yes, any new unique player will be blocked
Interesting
Last one
And thanks for your patience and fast replies
Where can I find the premium features?
Theres only a few (basically everything is included), but the premium specific commands can be found here: https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=premium-commands
For premium itself, check out https://www.neatqueue.com/dashboard
Link takes me to a blank home screen for the bot. Probably because I need to sign in with discord first. I'll check that out. Really what I'd care most about is increasing the monthly player limit and daily game limit
is what you will see
Kk NOW last one. What's the $ to credit exchange rate lol
there is a calculator on the site, but its better to buy in bulk
its basically 1 to 1 at low conversions

Great looking bot so far. Appreciate the help
It is possible to define a discord role to see the queue without incognito mode, and the rest of the staff without being able to see who is in the queue?

I have two seperate queues and both linked to the leaderboard channel. But when I pull up both leaderboard the stats are correct but the tittles are the same .
How do I change the title?
sounds like a bug, are you selecting a different queue name with /leaderboard ?
So I select the correct leaderboard I want to show but it show with wrong title
Any idea how
To fix it?
strange, ill look into it
Okay thanks , keep me posted
this not true - unsure where you got that number from
this is true
"Yes, it is possible to set a fixed MMR for a player where the MMR does not change regardless of wins or losses."

is it really possible and how do i do that?
How can I set to allow for multiple winners? Could I do something like allowing ties? For example, I want to set up a game that's for 5 players and it's possiible for that game to have 1, 2, 3, 4, or even 5 winners (semi-cooperative board game)
And I'd like for this game to have an MMR leaderboard as well
Would this be too confusing for the MMR calculation / resultant change for each player?
mmr floor and mmr max
No its not possible
Or just change the mmr change to 0
Also, is it possible for an admin to be notified when the players' match results in a disputed result instead of the message just hanging there in the queue channel forever until someone finally caves and submits the correct result?
1st page of mmr leaderboard wont show up
or is that paid feature only?
No, theres not an option for that
I think you can create a webhook that will execute when it sends
it doesnt show up though
mmr max does but what is "mmr floor"
-d mmr minimum
was renamed a while ago
i dont think u guys get what i mean, i dont want an mmr range i want a fixed mmr for a player <@145305657237700608>
Like their MMR never changes?
like it doesnt change regardless the win or lose
ye ye
`/mmr change set 0`
is that for the server or can u do that to a specific player?
its for the whole queue
you cant apply it to a specific player
aight
you might be able to do
`/mmr multipliers set role:@Person multiplier:0`
although im not sure if that works
lemme try
oh but then the lose is going to decrease it even though the wins doesnt affect the elo right?
multipliers is not the solution i think
ah, right, nope wont work
its ok tho
i dont need it anymore i think
can I get any help on this
Any way to award ppl that come in 2nd or 3rd in an FFA game?
Or does only the winner see MMR gains while everyone else must lose MMR
Only team winner gets mmr
is there a way to remove the random option when picking maps?
Nop, I had this issue too
Any way to NOT allow anyone with a pending match result to queue until the match result has been resolved?
Example, in a 1v1 game, both sides report a win. I want them to not be able to queue until one of them puts in the correct result
`/requeue condition condition:Winner Selected`
Excellent, thanks!!
Quick question.  My friends queue kicks out 2 out of 10 of the players who join the queue.  Is there a setting that will allow you to lock the queue to only the first 8 who join?
are you using the matchmaking queue type?
I believe so
if you just want to automatically start when a queue is filled, change your /queuetype to PUGs

how do i fix this
it wont let me change the teamsizes

to teh queue
add the role multiply times
ex: Field, Field, Field, Goalkeeper
ohhhhhh
afk timer always 60 mins even if i disable or input other time length please help
why is it not adding/removing mmr properly
not sure what you mean? it says when the timer is disabled
someone has like -4 quadrillion MMR which probably throws off the math for calculating MMR change
is there a way to make it work while he has that little elo
you would have the set the MMR change as static so everyone gains/loses the same
since he is such low MMR, it thinks the match is insanely unfair, so nobody changes MMR
i disabled it then queued again to test it. i got kicked for inactivity after an hour
It could have been
-d timer queuereset
There is a timer for resetting the entire queue + a timer for removing specific players
thanks, i'll try that
Hello, I am French and don't speak English very well, especially technical English. Can someone help me to not have a voice channel but a text channel to welcome the participants. I thank you in advance, this bot is really good
Where can i configurated when my voice channels gets deleted? Bc my votes are on 8 but after 6 they VC's gets deleted.
I have a server minecraft where I want to get connected with those that want to do cw
how to do so?

Did that on 8 but still after 6 it deletes idk why
Can I restrict people from typing messages in the #queue382 channel, not the actual lobby channel
the one bot creates when queue is full
what command do i use to make it so when ppl don't join the vc to start the game, the players who are first in the queue get added and it doesn't just pick random ?
so im tryna make a ranked system but when people reach the mmr the role doesnt get given to the player what am i doing wrong any help?
Can someone explain how staff channel works? I thought I understood documentation and commands but setting the staff channel to send queue results is not working, queue results are only going to 1 channel and it's not the staff channel
-d staffchannel
ok i noticed something weird, idk if it's unique to my setup, but if i go into a queue channel and set the staffchannel to a channel but don't specify True or False for 'serverwide', it says staff channel was set to that channel for all queues, but doesn't do anything -- this might be an unhandled error state?

so when I specify False for 'serverwide', it properly set the staffchannel
i also tried specifying True for 'serverwide' and it shows the success message, but staff results stayed in the same channel (no change)
you might have a non-serverwide staffchannel for that queue
If there is a serverwide staffchannel + a queue specific staffchannel, it will favor the queue specific one
neatqueue api seems to be down rn
can anyone else confirm?
seems like it
its back now

what is the command to pick a random captain to host the lobby inside the queue message?

ie: Lobby Host: " @player"
-d lobbydetails set
Click the link and there is an example on the docs of that exact thing üòÑ
It should post the staff message as soon as the match is finished with setup
in the same channel as match results? how would i set the channel?
does the markdown formatting allow to put the lobby details at the very end?
not familiar with the commands
wdym at the very end?
same command, `/staffchannel`
is there a way so that we can skip the balanced/captains pick and go straight into joining teams? so for valorant 5v5 2 teams - go straight into joining teams because we determine the teams in game through autobalance
format it to be under ‚Äúchannel transcript‚Äù
no you cant customize that message
but also thats the staffchannel message, the normal results message is `/resultschannel`
any bot issues?

<@145305657237700608> Hello, is there like a log or smth like that, to check what time people joined a que?
Nope
Is there any way to alter the order in which the setup process works. 

Essentially I would like captains only to do a map pick/ban yet the pick ban is coming before the selection of the captains therefore it defaults for the team to do it
Currently set for teams to be chosen via 'Balanced on MMR'
The issue is cuz you are using balanced teams, so there is no captain selection
you should change your

why does there have to be a queue in progress to make changes
not exactly in progress, but you need a queue running in the channel
otherwise there is nothing to modify
if i make changes to it, and then end the queue, will the same changes be applied when i start a new one
no, but you shouldn‚Äôt be ending the queue
but if you do end a queue, you can use the config code to reload it
once you start a queue it can just exist forever
is it better to keep it running?
Lol thank you, im in a server where they end a queue everytime its done
Ill let them know, thank you for your help.

no- we are in a general channel
"Lobby Channel
Lobby Voice Channel: Disabled
Channel: None
Pull Players From All Channels: False

do I need to make one?
no but it shouldnt be pulling then

yes! maybe thats it
how could I set it to not move players?
Unfortunately there isnt a way to disable that
besides disabling the channels
gotcha
if I cvhange it to lobby channels could I set two to setup?

Hi, is there a way to get a basic template to make a random team generator. for a discord channel?/
My leaderboard doesn't display players anymore its entirely blank, all the data should all be there and I havent closed or locked the queue. Any fixes?
what have u changed about it?
welp I just discovered all the stats have been reset. :/
I used the /leaderboard command that changed the stats from server wide to be queue specific and its reset all the stats for everyone in the server
even changed it back to see if that fixed it but it doesnt
unless you ran `/managestats reset`, nothing was reset
your queue is probably just pointing at the wrong stats
whats ur server ID ?
how do I tell you that? sorry.
that?
in your main queue do `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set name:player_stats`
and you should see your stats
lifesaver
thank you sir
<@145305657237700608> i trying to do a random team generator.... I have everyone in a queue but whats the next step to get it to generate??
Did the queue start?
whats the issue then ?
wait it didnt start we just in a queue...sorry
you need to fill up the queue then
nice then it will sort teams by itself??
If u didnt modify anything, there will be a menu where you can choose the mode teams will be selected, in one of these, random is an option, so you will probably want to just straight up go to random, in order to do that you can do `/teamselection set`, and when u execute the command, only select random, so the voting menu wont appear, and it will be always random
it worked!! can we stop the voting process??
this is awesome
if you want to change how teams are picked (or skip the vote), use `/teamselection set` like Don Soap mentioned

hi , can we avoid the temporary closure of the channel in order to give spectators time to bet. Thank you in advance
wdym temporary closure ?
the temporary channel where we vote and score the matches is closed, declaring the match a tie. He didn't give us time to play the match, can we vary the opening of this channel?
The channel will always be deleted when the match is marked as completed
that means the players scored it!  there is no timer on it? I need a log I think
there is also a timer which automatically resolves a match after 1.5 hours
-d timer matchcleanup
This must be what closed the match for me, I will increase this value, thank you for the efficiency

After that the voice channel closes and the text one too
its only 6 players?
It‚Äôs 10 players per queue
oh wait nvm
Normally 8 need to vote but as you see 6 votes and still closed etc
hmm i see
seems that the bot resolves the match anyways since Blue team got a majority vote, and it doesn't matter what the other players vote
but it should respect the setting better
I mean normally it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem but our players tend to early vote and we want to avoid that with 8 votes
Because it instantly closed the queue and the voice channels even if they are still in game.
they probably shoudnt be voting before they know who won lmao
but yea, i will fix it
Yeah told them several times but sadly they barely hear on that üòÖ

Thanks!
Would have a little different question as well. Because I got that thing reported rn.

It seems one of my players voted early and were able to join the next queue even if the old queue isn‚Äôt finished yet. Can I do something against that maybe ?

it only happens whilst one queue is already going on (i.e. team 1 and team 2 vc is already there)
What VC are you talking about?
ok and can we prevent betting on our match
to avoid cheating , prevent players of the match from being able to bet
you can only bet on your own team
ok, you have thought of everything, thank you for the details
so when queue starts, a vc is made so all 6 players can join and teams can be made
they cant join if one queue is already made
It should be a new VC with the queue number in the name
that one?
<@145305657237700608> Our Mix leaderboard MMR page 1 is not displaying but every other type of page displays fine
can we do something with these points, role purchase system or other
what does it show
there is no "shop" built in, but you can make your own version by manually removing points when someone "purchases" something
the only real uses of points are for predictions and
-d queueentry price
what happens if you click the title and view online?
it works if we click
<@145305657237700608> why doesnt cancel work in match, match creates new channel and in that channel if i use cancel it doesnt work
and also i did team selection captains
it didnt work for some reason players still vote for captains, random teams etc
if u you use /cancel, they need to vote to cancel the match
`/outcome cancel` is the one to cancel immediatly
ye i know they need to vote but it doesnt give that option
I want to setup another q in my discord. I had an issue where the stats would disappear and you guys helped me last time to fix it. 

How do I set it up so q its a similar config but the stats will be separate for both qs?
what happens instead?
can you invite so i can take a look?
you can use /config save and /config load to copy the queue config to other channels
if you want to swap to fresh stats in the new queue, follow

how to check how many games are left in queue
i mean until limit
<@&931725518074699842>
theres no way to see that, you just need substract your games and the limit games for your tier
`/serverstats info` to see your games
why can only half the lobby vote on the cancel
Are you sure  you are in the match?
me and my friend cant join the queue it wont register
did i do something wrong with roles or permissions?
I have a question
If I have a Asia and North America queue for a server
How do I make it so they don‚Äôt have the same leaderboard

So do I name it differently
if you have serverwide stats disabled, yes
I did that
And the leaderboard is still showing
For a 4v4 queue for a diffeeent region
Do you know the command
in a different channel?
if they are named different, then you just have one of the other settings overriding it
these are what‚Äôs used to figure out what stats to use
I was able to create a different leaderboard
But now my old leaderboard for a different type of queue is cooked
use /link
now that there are 2 queues, the bot doesn‚Äôt know which one to show
I linked it now
But all the elo was lost
depends what you changed
I changed the name of the queue with leaderboard stats
I linked each queue
changing the name will change the stats
Oh I see
Is there a way to bring it back
My old stats
I only changed the name of the other queue
changing the name of a different queue will not impact your current queue
unless it was with serverwide stats
Oh yeah I did that
And disabled it
then go into your old queue, and do
./leaderboardconfig sharedstats set player_stats
the name player_stats should pop up automatically
Wrong picture
Ok I got it back
But the leaderboard for the other channel is the same as this now
Lol I‚Äôm so cooked
Sorry
you have to change the name for that queue then
same steps
does anyone know why admins cant see the actual queue chat when people get into a lobby?
is it a setting or something
<@145305657237700608>
that just looks related to your perms in your server
Yeah I‚Äôve got it some clown messed with stuff, thank you anyway
Hey <@145305657237700608>

would it be best to turn Read Message History off in the queue channel for users clarity?
meh, i‚Äôm not a fan, but you can try it out
it takes over the channel completely
ill try without it then thanks!

but you can just use this command

What should I look for?
click the link?
just use that command
in discord
-d webhooks generatetoken
like that?
no, like /webhooks generatetoken
oh do I have to own a server with neat queue in it for this to work?
if you are using the token when interacting with a server using the API, you will need to be staff
I just want to read data, queue data, know what players are in queues
not post anything
https://api.neatqueue.com/docs
No yeah but dont I need an API token?
if the endpoint has a lock symbol then it requires a token and staff access
ohhh
I see
so I dont need a token for that then?
how do I create a continious queue?

Hey guys
How can i use the bot to criate a new channel for the queue
Tekat üó£Ô∏è
wdym? to create queues you can use ``/setup``
in the channel you want the queue in
My server's queue is set so that players cannot requeue until the winner is picked, we had a match that was canceled but the players from that match still cannot requeue because it tells them to select a winner, I have tried reloading the config, loading a different config, neither worked, the only other thing I know to try is removing the bot and re-adding it and starting from scratch which I don't want to do
removing the bot won‚Äôt do anything
it should say what match # should be resolved, you can try doing /outcome cancel
although if the match was cancelled it shouldn‚Äôt be having an issue
What is the command to create a queue and a table different from the one already on the server?
is there anyway to se all the info of a queue?
i can only see about 20 things in the /info command area  when it comes to auto rank roles
hmm like you have so many roles that it doesn‚Äôt show?
create a new queue via /setup and follow the rules of
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked

NeatQueue is bugged for me, it won't display any of the formatted text it's supposed to (people in queue, teams, etc.), I just get the buttons and all of its messages are otherwise blank:
make sure this setting is enabled
in your discord app settings
Oh, that did it
Man I must've tried everything except that one
Cheers
Would it be possible to make an automatic division system?
yes, check out /autoroles
Good afternoon I try to implement the NetQueu boe for my Lorcana server and I kind of struggle removing the team setup. I wish I could a simple matchmaker where when 2 people almost the same MMR are on the queue, there are linked together and can play
But when I do that, I am asked for a team selection and then to approve the team
Is there a way to remove that feature?
I have been able to remove the team selection step by auto selecting "random" but I still need to validate the team:
Hello , how to see all matches played on my server , the ai tell me to use /api/history command ? it does not work
-d teamselection reshuffle
or change the team selection too balanced, it‚Äôs a 1v1 so it doesn‚Äôt matter
the API let‚Äôs you fetch all matches played, what info are you trying to see
I need to cancel the matches rated as ties on my server so I can find their number, these are matches that I deleted and which were not played
Thank you it is working !
Do you know why it does create me 2 distinct channels?
il est top ce bot , et le dev est super r√©actif , c est nickel
Caremment, tu as un peu pratiqu√© d√©j√†? Je peux t'envoyer quelques mp pour ne pas polluer ce channel?
ouai on peut  s entraider je pense
j suis pas non plus tres fort mais il m interesse grave ce bot
it‚Äôs one per team which is enabled by default
-d voicechannels teamchannels
ties and cancelled matches are treated very similarly, why do you need to cancel them?
but the API would let you find them, you would have to sort through them though
I was the one who created test matches to see how the bot reacted, I didn't think it was going to influence the stats when I deleted the matches
wow it's a bit hard to use the API, I don't manage it, it's complicated for me but thanks anyway
you can use /set or /add to modify your own stats to account for them
How do we setup NetQueue to have 2 channel created :
1 written channel with the result to be entered
1 vocal channel to discuss and share camera
?
For now, I only have one vocal channel created
Thats by default
maybe there is something i need to re activate ?
-d tempchannels toggle
for the text channel
How do i make it defaultly a best of 3 and no voting menu for best of 1 or best of 3
<@145305657237700608>
the command has another argument called **vote**, set it to false
How i can make that ?
<@145305657237700608>
how can i make the neatqueue autodrag ppl into the newly made queue vc
<@145305657237700608>
like is there a set voice channel that needs to be made that the bot will drag ppl from into the new queue vc too or does it drag ppl into it from any vc in server?
with ``/commandbutton stats ``
good evening, the bot does not want to balance the matches by mmr! is this normal? thanks in advance
That looks balanced to me
sorry, you're right but it's the start of the ranking and it's not representative of the real level!
thank you NeatZ
Invalid command, try again?
hey, how do i disable max voice channel size thats created for teams? so people can join team 1 and team 2 VCs if they are not playing
either disable /channel restrictions or add a /spectatorrole
Hello, do you know how to change the channel where the results are written?
That message
`/resultschannel`
Thank you !
And how do I make the result submission into the temp channel?
You cant send the result on the temp channel
I can't send the result submission message to the temp channel?
The vote u mean? Thats by default
Oh then maybe I made a mistake
The message is listed under a regular channel
Hello! Is there a way for me to check a log of history of commands used for the NeatQueue bot?
Apparently some people's MMR was changed to a very low number and the logs don't show that they were changed manually.
-d logs
Apparently their stats changed when they checked their stats
How come this is happening?
That wont make any sense
Hey Don
quick question
for a queue with parties, how do I make a matchmaking queue correctly make teams where the parties are together
Yeah people had their stats changed when they were trying to check their own stats
It suddenly reset them to their starting MMR amount, 999
<@648635725964902411>
how can i make it to where if a new member joins the server they automatically get the MMR next to their name
Im not that much into parties, i guess matchmaking just doesnt support it
Yeah I‚Äôm not sure how to make it work
Parties can join the game but then they are split into the two teams
Do u have 2 queues by any chance
Not possible if they havent queued before
I think we have two separate queues that share the same mmr system
There may be one queue that has its own mmr system though
Could that be the reason?
It seems that our leaderboard got reset as well
If u didnt activate shared stats then it makes sense, queues dont share stats by default
Hello, this command seems not to exist in my channel
Am I wrong ?
That command doesnt exist
Ai just hallucinating
do you mean MVP? what is vip
Oh yes mvp
You are right
Hello, I did this but it only renamed the written channel
Is that normal ?
The vocal channel remains waitlist#xx
See number 23
You cant set custom voice channel names, you either can have the captains name or not
Can someone help me create autoroles (ranking), I don't understand English very much
I tried to read the guide about autorole but I can't understand
``/autoroles mmr set role: lower_rating: upper_rating:`` is the standart command to create autoroles
thank you brother
let me know if u need more help
In short, will I define a number of points for them to reach the rank(role)?
and can I form teams and queue according to rank?
for example if u got: ``lower_rating:`` 1000 ``upper_rating:`` 1500 
everyone between those 2 numbers will get the autorole
wdym
Bronze 0 - 400
Silver 400 - 550
Gold 550 - 700
Diamond 700 - 950
Challenger 950 - 2000


Basically I'm going to set the roles this way with these scores, is it possible for me to create some rules where challengers and diamonds don't fall with bronzes and silvers?

Hey <@145305657237700608>, how do I fix my situation
Apparently players are having their MMR reset whenever they check their stats
and when I check our leaderboards, it's completely cleared out
Is it because of having two different MMR system, like having a separate leaderboard?
If so, how do I fix this?
It depends on what you did really
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).

This is how the bot determines what stats to show/use for any specific queue
which command did you change?
I'm not sure
I'm actually really confused what's happening

and i assigned a voice chat to join the queue, when we play and finish it bring us back to this channel and filled up again and start a new queue lobby immedietly, how to stop this please ?
also when the queue filled up everyone stays in the join queue voice chat that i set and create the queue vc and keep it empty without moving the players in the queue thats in it

Hmm im not sure if its possible to have the a VC be the lobby channel and join queue channel
/permisions
is there anyway to have different leaderboards for different queues?
please, how to make players on the queue move to the created queue vc on ready up section, they stay on the join queue vc i set.

and how to stop bringing them back to the join queue vc i set. after the match ends (cuz it immedietly filled up and start another match, bros stop from playing). i just want to kick everyone from the VC after the match ends or moving them to diffrent vc just dont bring them back to previous vc and start a match immedietly

Did you try what I said?
`/lobbychannel pullall` and `/lobbychannel returnall`
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
i did TYSM this what i was looking for "/lobbychannel returnall". but it wont move players to queue voice channel on ready up button mode, on voice chat it moves normally only ready up button not, how to make move them on ready up button pls
At least currently if you have ready up via buttons, it wont move the players to the VC
so its not possible to move them on ready up button?
not currently, but i will change it so its not needed
I think it should only depend on the `/lobbychannel pullall` setting
yeah i tried it. it works but only after team select (after setup and everything...) moving them to their team vc. i want it to move everyone on the queue to the queue vc & meet before team select.

on join lobby voice channel (ready up settings) it works, but on ready up button option it's not
<@145305657237700608>
Is it possible to use NeatQueue for Teamfight Tactics as a competition-based MMR leaderboard, rather than matchup-based?
I cant see why not
I am trying to set it to allow people to not use push to talk in the temp voice channels and for some reason it just won't work
Thats something with your category perms
Not really something with the bot
then why does it only do it in the queue and team vcs?
Do you have more vcs on the category the queue vcs are created?
oh I see what you mean now I'll try that
Bot works amazing. Only question is when i set to show peoples mmrs by their nickname, it only pops up for new members. Not members who were already in the server. How do i fix it?
They need to queue
If you specified the queue names when using /ratinginname it should nickname everyone <:thonk:1046834032417189978>
hmmm okay ill double check
i cant figure out what to input in for my que name into " ratinginname queuenames ". Also i appreciate all the help you guys do üôÇ greatly appreciated
i figured it out!
the owner doesn't have any visible mmr now, but everyone else does.
Discords owners are untouchable when it comes to nicknames
alright thank you! Your guys's support is insane keep up the good work
how do i disable server members to do /ping
<@145305657237700608>
<@648635725964902411>
like so they cant do /ping
How do I add it to a channel ?
How do I set the queue up?
when the match ends and everyone vote for a winner (or i do as an admin), it just move everyone to the first vc in the server. i want to choose/assign the channel that i want to move everyone after the match ends. how to do pls ?
In your server integration settings you can disable any command
that would be /lobbychannel set, but it would only move to a VC if it was assigned
or you have /lobbychannel returnall
hello i need to change the settings in the commands to allow only owner and admins to use commands on the bot how can i do that
to use only allow what commands?
commands with the little "ADMIN ONLY" are only usable for the owner and admins
to only allow to use commands , any commands to admins and owner only
then you have to remove the bot from the channels where members can type
got it thanks
the /removechannel command doesnt work when i use it
Because it doesnt exist
thats the one your ai support just recommended to use
could you guys give me the right command to remove bot from a channel please ?
I dont understand what you mean by removing the bot from a channel
refering to this
so that no users  can use commands in channels where they can type
does ur bot is open source ?
you do that in the server settings
not with the bot
like this
or look for a tutorial on youtube
I got kicked out. I don‚Äôt know why but could you please help me?
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/935730993451655168/1194053110461644830
Rule 3
How can I rejoin the server?
it keeps setting the channel name back to 2v2 queue 1 arch
what do I do?
-d channel name
./channel name
must have some override set up
this is all there is?
do i have to set them all to that
IS there a way i can hide the temporary VC's for the queue's so only the 6 people in the Queue can see them so theres less clutter in our server?
also need to give my players the option to either randomize teams or pick teams at will
Is there a way to make joining a voice channel not necessary but also create a separate text channel?
You can do that via category settings perms
And for players to choose, /teamselection
`/readyup mode`
I keep getting unexpected error when I run `/managestats copy`
The option to declare a winner I don't think is showing after the match has started, is it possible for players to have the option to declare a winner without admin manually entering the command?
The winner voting message I don't think is appearing
Yes, in your staff result channel
If you dont have one, try ``/staffchannel set channel:``
Overwatch: 6v6 Adjustments ?
try again but just let it takes it time
it just errors out immediately after submitting command
I have given my bot perms but it still says it needs to manage my channels? am i being dumb or?
What exactly does it say?
Hey I am looking for some help setting up my Queue Bots, I am having a little bit of a hard time. Perhaps if someone here who is experienced could help me that'd be amazing, willing to pay USD.
Just DM me/Ping me for more detail.
bonjour, des fran√ßais ?
J'aurais besoin d'aide pour configurer un NQ ^^
Hello i need help to set my server
Queue is okay
But the result isn‚Äôt share when players are joining the match
No one can vote cause the message witch the 2 players isn‚Äôt share.
Queue is 2 players (1 teams 2 player)
No more after this step‚Ä¶
I could probably help ya, dm me if you still need help with your setup.
How do i move this message to a different channel?
<@145305657237700608>
``/resultschannel channel:``
How to i put this in another channel?
<@145305657237700608>
``/staffchannel set channel:``
O I think I am having an issue where the voting screen doesn't appear, I have tried setting staff channel and changing permissions but the neat queue bot seems to stop showing the screen

The people who joined the match also seem to be able to join a new queue without needing to vote for a winner
hello what comman can i use to put a treshgold on who can be captain
Requeue condition
And what changes have u made
Hello guys
How can i set the victory message ?
I need player can vote for the winner
What victory message?
Thats by default
Yes but that's no work
The temp channels aren't closing :(
How to desactivate this choice ?
``/teamselection set ``
Ok but I dont want to have 2 team I just want 2 players in the same match + result of the match
what queue are you using?
Pugs?
I use matchmaking
And I set 2 players in 1 team
The queue is okay but there is no results
you have to set a channel for the results
``/resultschannel channel:``
Yes it‚Äôs already done
But that‚Äôs no work
No results is communicating
what did i say when you used the command?
I mean, if u have 1 team theres nothing to vote about
That makes sense now
Ok so
Why when 1 player by team + 2 team, the channels are 2 and not 1
Players cannot play together‚Ä¶
Just disable the channel voice limit then
Or disable teamchannels
hi can i use the api for a matchmaking web instead of discord?
you could try, probably will be a lot of effort
if the api isn¬¥t fully private good
Oh players still are able to reque even though the condition is set to must vote, while the voting screen isn't showing, I tried creating a new server and added neat queue, the voting screen not showing seemed to happen again, would there be something I could do to fix this?
What have u changed?
Oh I have tried changing voting menu timer, team selection, and tried it all back with commands to default, but I don't think that has worked
Okay! Changed team size to 2 and changed it to select team on join seems to have worked, Sorry I think the way I did  /setup in Pugs wasn't working
Is there a way via the API to list the current parties that have been created?
Having an issue with users party queuing, but not realizing the other person isn't online, resulting in them losing mmr and being queue banned
Looking at this from a more administrative standpoint, /party view gives a list of parties in the slash command options but nothing in the API docs I see shows those values
Also, Party View slash command throws an error saying it's been recorded.
<@&931725518074699842> is it possible that queue bugs if too many players spam join, what happend to me in my server is there were 4 players already in queue(its 6 players queue) waiting to play, when one queue finished all 6 players from that queue spammed join for next queue with 2 slots left. What happend is that queue started and just randomly deleted itself
Anything?
No not currently
If there is an API that would be helpful just DM me for the data you need
and ill try and add one
Alright, will do
/test is not working?
Wdym is not
nvm is working xd
just out of curiosity because i couldnt find anything regarding this on the premium side of things it says "allows all customization" but im not really sure where or what the commands are to configure and customize whatever i am able to customize
is there anyone who can help me with this
give me a second
If you want to see all the premium commands which "allow all the customization" just type ``/premium`` here or in a server with NeatQueue.
gotcha gotcha
damn that was fast
welcome to premium
Is it possible to create multiple queues like 2 matchmaking √≠n the same discord? Bc for me the bot says "interaction failed"
yes it is possible
just keep trying
<@145305657237700608> is possible to assign a role when a user use the /register command?
is there a reason i cant see it in my server even tho i have a month worth of credits
You cant see it or you cant use the commands? Can you send a screenshot of it?
You have to buy a plan with your credits to activate Premium if you didn't do that alredy.
what details do you need to add for your valorant account to be accepted in /register?
shows this when i do /register "REY Oli#xyz" <- which is my tag
also when i create a queue, is it possible to make it so once the teams are decided it moves them into a vc for each team?
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>
Thats by default
it didnt do it for some reason when we did tests
also sorry to keep bothering but is it possible to make it so only people with a specific role can access the queue?
also when i say role i mean like discord role
emm where is the readme or someone can help with the question
i want the users to set their steamid
Theres not readme
Ai just saying things
<:Shrug:1171270284670668830>
I have them applied, the dashboard says so. I just cant see them show up when i type /premium
that‚Äôs not a command, if you goto https://docs.neatqueue.com there is a premium command section
yeah kinda mb
it still would work hehe
O is there a way to have 2 teams but both teams are different sizes?  /team size seems to change both teams
Not possible
hello, when people who are not in the q are joining teams channels they get muted, how do I disable that?
is there a limit to how many channels we can link to a queue ?
I‚Äôm afraid to break something. I want to make it to where each month it doesn‚Äôt reset the monthly stats
how to disable clear q command?
or limit usage of slash commands in the main q channel to a ceratin role?
nope
your server integration settings lets you change command visibility
do you currently have monthly stats enabled?
If I disable monthly leaderboards does it reset everyone‚Äôs rank?
Or take away leaderboards in general?
how can i brogaming the bot ?
<@145305657237700608>
What
it will make new leaderboards that are not tracked per month
just 1 overall leaderboard
<@145305657237700608> ^
how do u delete a queue
/endqueue
guys its not working
i dont know what to do
2 situations
the first one is that i deleted the old queue, and the stats are the same for the new one
like
on the old queue my mmr was 1800 right
in the new one i setted everyone for 1000
and my stats still show the victories of the old queue, and my mmr is still 1800
the second situation is that THE QUEUE DOESNT START
i have to /forcestart every single time
and i setted it to autostart
when 10 people are at the queue, 2 teams, 5 people each
i dunno what to do
help <a:CryingManAnimated:1157563847436140584>
i solved the mmr problem
but the queue is still not starting automatically
it worked
ehehee
forget it
Where can i request someone to make a more simplified version of this bot? Our server has 5v5s in the same vc, and we would like to add the teams manually without having to join the queue and pick the winning team by hand.
i.e. trying to get rid of the "voting" and making separate vcs the bot moves us in
would be willing to compensate as well
Theres no way for selecting manually
The other things like vc creation, u can get rid of that
Is there anyway to make it to where people can access the in game names to add the other players quickly?
`/ign`
<@648635725964902411>  How do i check the game modes and maps?
/info
i have it set to random and it keeps picking the same map everytime
Is there anyway to get the winner for queue to auto delete after so long?
If someone can help me with cancel command, it doesnt work for players, when they try to use it they just get error, only admins can cancel game with outcome cancel
Try just `/cancel`. This will start a vote to cancel the queue, where `/outcome cancel` is an admin only thing
I have that option turned off for my server because some people were starting to try and cancel because they simply didn't like the team they were drafted to. I forgot how I did that, but I can figure it out of you want me to
** **
** **
Off-topic from the above...

I figure the bot is right with this reply, but I wanted to pop in and ask about it in case there was some sort of workaround you think I could do.
i know cancel is for players, but they cannot use it, even admins cant use cancel, so admins have to do outcome cancel every time
thats issue
Not really, all stats are individual
And by "doesnt work" you mean what exactly?
actually there is no option for players at all to do cancel
i mean when they write /cancel they dont get that menu if you know what i mean
it just writes it as normal message
And are you sure u didnt disable that command via server settings?
`/serverstats info` doesn't seem to be working. I've tried running it several times in multiple channels in my server.
Hmm works for me
That's odd. I even checked the integrations, and it seems normal
The reason why I'm trying to do it is because I have 3 queue names that are apparently all the same
if you have monthly stats it might be showing up weird
one for each month
Ahhhh. Yeah yeah
does it instantly give that error? or after some time?
might be very slow with larger servers with a lot of games played
i‚Äôll probs have to work on that
It's not *instant* instant, but it does happen pretty quickly
hmm interesting, it should be sending over a ‚Äúthinking‚Äù response pretty quickly, i‚Äôll look into it this weekend when i‚Äôm home
thanks for the vid
<a:AM_ThumbsUp:998965078391013497>
I deleted the server i was payign for the bot in
will my subscription be cancelled
quick question is there a way to get rid of theses messages in the channel so the the channel is just clear and only has the queue
You can set another channel for the results
`/resultschannel`
i have one already
and it still sends there
Then u didnt do it right or confused another queue, thats the solution
u see where it says "queue #9" i want that gone
the other one i fixed
Oh i see, youre not creating new channels
cuz i just want it to be cleared of all the extra stuff for example
subscriptions are not auto renewed so you should be good
you want new channels for each queue probably
like this is the stuff i dont want in the same channel as the queue
-d tempchannels toggle
i have a channel for each queue, and the results of each queue
but do i need a temp text channel just to get rid of that extra stuff?
cuz i want it so people can do the vote from the queue channel and it just goes away after the decision is made
yes, either a temporary channel or thread
but then they would have to go to that temp channel to vote on a map right ?
yea then its useless
im not tryna have 18 million channels for each map vote of each queue
thats too much
the channel is deleted after the match
either way, its either the queue channel or a new channel
how do i get rid of this
and how do i move this to the another channel? (and i want it to be automatically deleted)
`/teamselection reshuffle`
And this is the queue chat, that channel will be deleted when the match is done
automatically?
becausae it's still there for me
and no the message is sent in the same channel as "Click to queue"
and that's what i dont want, i want people to click on Queue and then nothing is shown in that channel anymore besides that queue is set back to 0, and all the other stuff in another channel
is that possible
Did u disable temp channels?
./tempchannels toggle mode: ?
should i enable it
That will create a channel for each new queue, that will be deleted after the match is done
In that channel there will be the votement so is not on the queue channel
i have it on, but it's a voice channel
like whenever i queue it creates a voice channel and i should join to queue
it doesn't create another text channel
LETS GO IT WORKED
but this valid thing still shows
in the new text channel is show
i have to click "valid" or not which is what i dont want
Did u disable it and tested it
Thats the command
i should disable it?
not enable it?
okay amazing mb üíÄ
oh and sorry one last thing, is there a way to disable creating voice channels because what im using it for is 1v1, so there is no point in the voice channels
`/voicechannels teamchannels`
If u dont want any
`/readyup mode mode:Disabled`
I mean, run both for no voice channels
i did
thank you so much
Uhm quick question. Im adding right now bit more auto assign roles but it stops displaying them is there a way to list them all?

And is there the possibility to remove from 1 queue the displayed mmr? Bc when i want to remove it from one queue it gets server wide disabled.
Theres probably a limit displaying roles on the embed message, i guess you have a lot of autoroles (?)
The second one, just disable rating in name in the queue u want
Run the command on the queue channel u want to
yea that‚Äôs a good point, the embed currently will cut itself off when it‚Äôs too large
probably need to think of something better
/ratinginname is a server wide configuration since the nickname is server wide
do you mean changing the /ratinginname queuenames?
Ah i missread, i thought he said he had serverwide disabled lolz
Yeah made a bit to much it seems üòÖ
Yes bc i run two queues at the same time rn.

A test queue and a normal matchmaking queue but when people join they get from the other queue the points in there name but they shouldn‚Äôt get it from test queue.
So only matchmaking queue should give the ratingname not test queue
gotcha, then you will need to do /ratinginname queuenames
and specify the queue stats you want in the name
Ah okay so i make this command and can specify it. Thanks üôè
Abt the autoroles there is probably atm no solution i could use to see every rank right?
Hey support, been trying to solve this issues and setup a queue. If people don‚Äôt move to the voice channel in like seconds it kicks everyone. Love some help, thanks!
`/readyup mode`
Also, its on seconds because youre on /test mode, it will decrease a lot your timers, normally u will have 5 minutes to join
How does one manually clear the leaderboard
To clean the leadearboard youll need to reset the players stats
`/managestats reset all`
Thank you so much for the help! No kicks at all now using test mode. Helped a ton ü§ò
Hey sorry to bother
I wanna ask
so recently I started another queue and it's team vs team
I set the queue team size as 6
but what if there are some parties only have 5 players
queue still manage to start a match?
or I should restrict them to find at least 6 players in their party?
Game is Counter-Strike. So the maximum player in a team is 5
6th player is the sub
Is there a way to delay the deletion of the voice channel? As example everyone needs to leave to get it deleted.
And how does the streak exactly works?
bc when i make autoroles for that after 5 wins or losses it dont give the role or the mulitplier.
are you doing the Full Team vs Full Team queue type?
streak is just number of wins in a row
or a negative streak is number of losses in a row
full team vs full team
yeah trying it rn with some people we make the same teams and win 5 games but nothing happens
same for lose streak
when you select that queue type it will ask if you want to restrict parties to matching the team size
you would pick No
do any autoroles work? if not, make sure the bot is able to assign roles
it needs to be above all the autoroles in the role hierarchy
yes it works with my other normal roles but not with the win and lose streak role
no command to change? only by reset a queue?
did that with 1.2 as mentioned in docs so i get a 20% boost of mmr.
"TestQueue" is my config if you can look over it pls.
use /queuetype
it actually might not pop up inside of /setup
got it
But it dont gives the role and the multiplier idk why.
So the queue limit means it‚Äôs a limit as to how many times we can use the bot per day?
If so how many times for the free version if the $5 is 150 times
only thing i can think of is that the bot can‚Äôt manage those roles
50 games a day for free
anyway to get it cheaper
<@145305657237700608> Hello.
Lets say we wanna switch a player from team 1 to team 2, so player 1 switch place with player 2, so they just switch teams, what command is that? 
 / player sub? Coze when we do that command, 1 of the players is not being seen in the teams and the other 1 is seen in both teams
hmm yea subbing might not work between 2 teams
it‚Äôs more meant to swap someone out of the match entirely
But why can he give the other roles then ?
And the multiplier isn‚Äôt working either it seems same for the placements
It‚Äôs pretty weird rest works fine except those things
Is there a way to swap players between teams? Our player base is a bit special, coze they misslick, pinging people (which makes them pick players) and stuff like that
Hi, how much it costs to be premium and where can I pay it

My bot has stopped working yesterday, been running fine for the last week
Can join queue but won‚Äôt don anything else after
How do i separate winner message from  resuslts ?
``/resultschannel channel:`` for the results
<@1194079999846793248> The /staff channel isnt working in my server wont change the channel
for the queue
``/staffchannel set channel:`` should work
okay let em try that
it effects this message
yes thats the one i want in another channel
it wont change
is there anyway u can look at this?
<@1194079999846793248>
not really
<@145305657237700608> any idea?
ima record it rq
wont let me send the video as embed
only file
can screenshare?
<@1194079999846793248>
there the video
nvm i figured it out had to delete staff channel from each queue and set them one by one serverwide didnt work for me
how do u turn captians off?
how does one get a leaderboard like this?
or is this old?
Thats just the normal leadearboard
`/teamselection set`
how do we send the leaderboard into the server?
/leaderboard
also is there anyway to change the queue name in the winner stats ?
also do i need to link the queue to the channel i want the leaderboard in 
?
says no queue found
im also sharing the stats serverwide for leaderboard so do i need a type of leaderboard when it ask for queue name
<@648635725964902411>
instead of it saying queue 17 and so on so on ? can it say like 1v1 #13
or somthing
something
how do i stop mmr from resetting daily?
you could try via the /language command
thats not a thing
ok well when i do leaderboard it shows all the stats apart from mmr
like its just empty even tho we had mmr
and it changed roughly at 00:00
did you end the queue?
no queue is still live
it just doesnt show score anymore
if you click the embed title, does the website show any stats?
yeah when i click the link i can see the stats, but ideally i see them here on discord
click the refresh button?
nope still nothing
its premium options ?
<@145305657237700608>
okay awesome ty and what about the leaderboard?
do i need ot link the channels to make the leaderboard go into differnt channel thats not the channel with the queue ?
btw <@145305657237700608>  Very dope bot man i see your the dev!
im trying to figure out why not everyone has the [1000]
points at the suffix of their name like i  set it up.
``/link channel:``
somebody please ping me if they have a solution for mmr not showing here but embeded link still works
same isuse
How come not everyone has mmr showing in my discord? It‚Äôs on suffix
have they queued
No but others haven‚Äôt
And show it
I thought maybe it was due to bots role being below staff and owner role. But that didn‚Äôt change anything
Should I do the commands again to disable it and then do it again?
<@145305657237700608>
Why can‚Äôt I rename the bot
you can
<@1042156460907450378> how
write click on the name, then change nickname
Hm weird my other roles working perfectly fine only win/lose streak and placements don‚Äôt work rn.  

And the multiplier isn‚Äôt working either it seems same for the placements

Tried already everything but idk what I do wrong
I have it set that when the player gains mmr, after a specific mmr amount his role changes to the higher rank
but I tried going backwards, losing mmr, the player doesn't lose his higher rank to the previous one if he loses mmr, why?

and what's the command for each of these (in case i wrote the wrong commands)
does anyone know the solution?
I don't really understand your problem, the command to add ‚Äúranks‚Äù for a given number of mmr is ``/autoroles mmr set role: lower_rating: upper_rating:``
why is this happening
after the queue is filled
whats your config? `/config save`
seems the message its trying to send is too large
Fixed, thank you
Hey Support. Almost done setting up.. Is it possible to have a best of 3 queue and two different game modes that are randomly selected for each round? i.e (TDM, HP, TDM) I cant figure out how to add game modes but did add randomizer. Thanks for help!
when you add a map via `/map add`, you can specify the gamemode
Really appreciate it thanks! Didn‚Äôt notice the next option in map add. Awesome program you have here üî•
I just noticed staff roles and owners don‚Äôt lose mmr
How do I fix that
thats not a thing by default, im not quite sure how you would configure that either
I noticed in my leaderboards that staff roles lose 0.0 mmr
I have myself and 2 owners
<@145305657237700608> see smileys stats
Mmr floor is 1000
Nvm he does
might just be that in that game people voted to disable MMR
which you might want to turn off that ability
it is turned off
hey guys how do I setup the leaderboard?
`/leaderboard`
how do i change bot profile picture
Not possible
i dont really understand the breakdown of premium and what not
it just says extra customization
https://docs.neatqueue.com
lists premium commands
but really you don‚Äôt need premium unless you are exhausting the free limits
basically every command is already free
Yeah, the most premium part is being able to have more games, queues and players
is there a way to switch the teams around without making a new queue if you queued into a rematch??
no a rematch will always be the same exact teams
so is there no way to switch the teams after they‚Äôve been made?
i have the free version and ihave the bot for a competitive siege organization
is there anyway we can incorporate our logo into the bot anywhere that idk about
i also dont understand like the queuemessage footer and stuff like that
there are some premium command options that let you
you can add it to the main queue message
how do i do that
also, i just enabled monthly leaderboard and set it to rolling over. that means mmr and stuff will never reset but it will log the stats every month correct? I just dont want mmr to reset
Will reset when the month is over
Ah rolling
i dont want it to reset until i tell it too
but i want it to log the monthly ending stats
It will keep rolling so np
how do i add logo to main queue message
`/message queuemessage image` but its premium command
<@145305657237700608> hey, sorry for the inconvience
but do you know how i could pay for premium for NeatQueue?
nvm found it
good day lads
question
when using neatqueue, everything works fine. giving mmr, giving rank roles, map selection, team balance etc etc.
it all works fine
however whenever we try to add winstreak and lose streak to the bot commands, it does not add the roles (win and lose) to the people, and it does not seem to register that people have a win streak 
is this a known issue or something configured wrongly? the bots permissions should be fine as it is able to give other roles and ranks to people.
also a question, how does the win and lose streak get calculated? or is it possible to set a static value for win and lose gains? for example, after 3 wins you start gaining an extra 10 mmr per win
Streak autoroles seem to be working for me
How did you configurated it ? Maybe I did a mistake
And what do you need to enable to make it possible ? Static or variable mmr?, do you need to activate the AC flags?,
I set my multiplier on 1,2 for a 20% boost as in documentation. Made a losses streak and a win streak autorole for both
And the bot has admin permission and is above all roles
hello guys,
i have multiple team selection mode activated (random teams & captains by highest elo) where the players choose which mode they want to play in. 
but, in this same voting panel, they also can vote for Enable MMR or Disable MMR and i want to remove this MMR vote - MMR changes are mandatory
how do i remove Enable MMR/Disable MMR for this voting panel?
<@145305657237700608> <@1194079999846793248> <@648635725964902411>
``/mmr change allow_disable allow_disable:``
is there a way you can show an example of the command set up or configuration?
`/autoroles streaks set role:Streak lower_value:1 upper_value:5`
Pretty simple, I added this autorole and won a match
and was given the Streak role
thank you!
I have just added the bot and pasted the r6 config from the configs channel, however i've run into the issue of not having join/leave queue options available. My queue is just stuck on queue started. How do i resolve this?
Can u send a screenshot?
im probably doing something wrong üòÖ
Thats weird, any perms the bot doesnt have, like embed links?
i'll have a look
it probs can‚Äôt send messages
Yeah apparently the bot didnt have embed links perm :/
thanks guys appreciate the help
just a quick question, how do i adjust the maps in the veto phase of a config?
Adjust in wich sense
change/add maps to the veto
`/map add` `/map remove`
thanks
is there a way to set that the bot move the players to a specific voice channel after a match ends?
-d lobbychannel set
oh i see
thanks
I'm facing problems.
C√≥digo de erro: TRNFK
something is causing the embed titles to be too long
is the queue name really long?
seems like the same issue as here, what was your fix?
Oh yes, it really could be that then.
How do I reset all my server members' points and channel numbers?
/managestats reset all
To add personalized information to the embed, what is the command?
what embed?
check out /message queuemessage
Thank you, but that's not the information I'm looking for, I'll be clearer. After selecting the teams, information such as map, password and teams.
-d lobbydetails set
The bot on our server is atm pretty slow is there something what i can do against it?
Its general issue. Seems like bot get used more than it can handle. Developer should definitely do something about it, either refactor or improve something
Its especially laggy in last few days
ah okay thanks
Win/Lose streaks seems to barely work when i use non static mmr. But sometimes it gives the role and sometimes not its very random.

Idk why the bot does it like that.
I have created a new queue in my server. This queue I try and apply a role that my members have from using a third party verification bot I have in my discord but NeatQueue is not stopping players who dont have the role. I have checked and made sure the role has been applied to the /rolerequirment add command and removed all other roles ands the issue still persists. Any ideas on how to fix?
are you talking about streak multipliers or the role multipliers
streak multiplier. So that he gets the autoroles win and autoroles losses + the multiplier from 20%
sometimes it works and sometimes its bugged for me at least yesterday.
any ideas? or could it be a bug?
if you check your /info you should be able to see the role requirements
everyone was set as a role
But yeah idk what to do against it.
Is there a way to save the leaderboard stats even if you make /managestats reset all player?
"Leadearboard stats", such thing doesnt exist, the leadearboard is just the visualization of the data in your queue
with the mmr system, can i have it auto put mmr in someones nickname? like lets say if i win something, and my name is Pipe [100] i gain 100 mmr, can it change the number to 200?
automatically so i dont have to manually
-d ratinginname
im in a siege server, how do i set it so that the winners get 70-90 mmr per win but the losers lose 50
If the lose is going to be exact, then the win cant be between a range of numbers
You would do it by setting to true static
I would like to go back from the number #01 of the pugs, but the reset command is not working.
There is no way to change the queue numbers
How do I make it so that everyone *isn't* required to join the VC?
-d eadyup mode
-d readyup mode
TYSM
-d config
I have a quick question, i just wanted to confirm, does the mmr multiplier for a given role only affect wins.
e.g. I can make Rank E players gain 1.5x mmr when they win but only lose a regular amount.
which database do you use exactly for bot?
Hi guys, how do I setup a Question that pops before the players being able to queue? For example: players click the "Join Queue" button and it appears something like "Will you try your best?" and they can only join que Queue if they answer "Yes". In AI support told me that i could use /lobbychannel quiz but this command does not exist/work, maybe i'm doing something wrong idk
Yea the AI was wrong
but you can use
-d queueentry survey
-d queueentry survey add
mongo
thank you
Is there a way to make like a new season for the bot and keep the old season or do I have to wipe the current season?
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
depending on how your stats are configured, it could be as simple as changing the queue name
Thank youuuu
hi it says interaction failed while trying to do anything, any particular reason for it
queue is stuck, can't even manually give a win/loss
^ happening here
any way to fix it?
<@145305657237700608> ima assume bots offline
anyone knows how to solve this
and how to send the queue message after it disappears
bot was struggling, try again
<@145305657237700608> all our bot settings been reset?
still struggling i guess?
hey guys, having the interaction failed issue serverwide, any fixes yet?
Yeah it's pretty busted in our server right now as well
Glad it's not just us
Queue fills, never starts the game, starts new empty
Manually ended it and started a new one and then it just disappeared
yeh all fkd rn unfortunate
restarting
restarting what?
Thanks <@145305657237700608> it seems to be functioning for me now
the bot
Hey having a problem at the start of this month my map picking was slighty different.

Both teams were able to ban 2 per team and after that both could pick but now since few days it changed to only team 1 can i change that back to the all can pick?
Having a problem with the leaderboard. Using /leaderboard the MMR is accurate but if you change pages at all then it permenately references old MMR data
depends on your config
if there is only 1 map ban or not enough maps then it might only do 1 vote
Having 8 maps in the pool so 4 gets banned 4 are left.
Do i need more than 4 left to get both teams picking maps?
no that should be fine
so what happens, it just does 1 map ban?
No per team you can ban 2 maps. So 4 maps gets banned.

But now only 1 team can pick maps not both.
At the start of aug it was possible to let both teams pick maps.
Since 1-2 days its not possible anymore.
if you send your config i can check
havent made any updates recently
Sure CRPYW
Idk maybe i made something wrong?
Win/Lose streak works weirdly as well but thats a minor issue for me.
This and leaderboard issues this morning.
Just tested this config and saw 2 map bans per team + 1 map pick
thats not what you see?
Yes that‚Äôs the thing I see atm. But i had a time where blue and red team were able to pick.
But looking in my previous queues and it seems it was always red team who were the pickers for the map. Can‚Äôt both teams pick a map? At least on my test queue I‚Äôm sure it worked
Sadly didn‚Äôt saved the transcript so can‚Äôt look in it.
Depends on how many maps are being played
If its a best of 1, its only 1 map
How many maps are required to get both teams to pick ?
if you want both teams to *pick* a map, then you need at least a best of 2
Having 8 maps in my pool. 4 getting banned so 4 left to pick
-d bestof
If its a best of 1 (default), it will only pick 1 map
Ah okay it‚Äôs not based on maps left. Now I got it thanks.
Yup exactly, no prob
i dont want them to jvc i want to make a ready button and when both click ready then we will start the queue
-d readyup mode
Also how i end the queue if one player goes afk
like he ready ups and afks
`/cancel` or `/outcome cancel`
For autoping, our ping message deletes itself shortly after sending it, which we don't want. How do we prevent the message from being deleted automatically? Coming from <#1131752660740083763>
currently no theres no config for that
ill add it to the command
Also, if there's a way to have a custom autoping message that'd be desirable as well. In my server we'd want the message to say what the exact queue size is (e.g. 2 out of 6) bc people will by default assume it's just 1
Or multiple autopings actually, e.g. we could set an autoping for 2/6, 4/6 and 5/6
hi, the bot stopped working, none of the commands work and it keeps saying "Interaction failed" or "app not responding"
is this happening just in my server or is it global?
<@145305657237700608>
mine too
not again
what is happening?
we had to do most of things manually
<@145305657237700608> <:sadcat:1179569615911800842>
I dont see multiqueue as a command, Or it that paid or smthn?
that command was actually removed like 2 years ago
what are you trying to do?
So how would I go about having multi of the same queue going
that works by default if you have /tempchannels enabled
Im running a 10 mans for siege, and we have so many people that 2 games can be running at the same time
since each match gets its own channel
Temps are enabled and I had 10 more people join the queue and it "created" but nothing happened and it cleared the queue
Maybe it was a bug?
Okay, maybe it was a bug, I just did /test (didn't know was a thing üòÖ) and it made another queue
Is anyone else experiencing a lot of slowness in the bot? Failed interactions but it will process it about a minute later? 

It seems to have started in the last 2 days, the restart yesterday fixed it for 12 or so hours but it seems to have gone back to being unresponsive
I'm having lots of issues in my server for the last 3 hours. Lots of failed interactions, bot not able to start the games and kicks everyone out of the queue. Any fixes or updates?
These issues are still persisting. I have created a new queue and re setup my settings and the issues still exist. Any advice would be much appreciated.
We got the same problem in our sergver
yeah same
its been really laggy r ecently
i‚Äôm gonna look at it today
yea it‚Äôs been bad
Tested it now but it‚Äôs not really what i meant. They have two maps now with best of 2 but it should be only 1 map
As example:

After they banned it should be possible as it is shown in the screen but then only one map should get picked not like here two
if you want 1 map, then it should be a best of 1
Yeah but blue and red team should pick maps not only red team
That doesnt make sense
I dont know your game though
Is there multiple maps per game or something?
Most games play a single map for a match
On some games you and the enemy team can pick a map.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do
So Team A and Team B can pick maps
This is what you need then
if you want 2 maps
They just should pick and out of there picks 1 map get picked
Not 2 as here
??????
So you only want 1 map?
Yes but BOTH teams should be able to pick not only 1 team
Idk how to explain it better
I understand now
At least currently you cant have map bans be per team, and map selection be for all teams
Its either all per team votes, or all team votes
Okay so it‚Äôs not really possible to make 2 teams ban and 2 teams pick map?
-d map voting
This is the config for that
Ah okay and when i pick all all of my 10 people in the queue can vote ? Not only the first team ?
correct
Thanks will try that and sorry for confusing you üòÖ
You had it working before ü§£ what did u do
how do i set roles by mmr?
like ranks
i can do that right?
like 1000 mmr - iron
1400 mmr - silver
-d autoroles mmr
Idk didn‚Äôt changed a thing
bot is down again
it doesnt work
im paying for bot that bugs every 2 days absolutelly, i dont know you either need to reduce number of people using it or improve it idk
how do i role the top 1 mmr?
-d autorole topplayers set
but thats according to mmr or points?
thanks
I'm still having issues with failed interactions and the bot kicking people out of the queue when it reaches the required amount of players but not creating a match. Any ideas or fixes?
What was the command to temporarily pause/disable the queue channel so players can not add to the queue? I can't find it, but I remember using it.
-d lock
how to control what roles can see the channel created by the bot
It‚Äôs gives an option after people join the voice channel to vote on what type of match they want to play, how do I skip that and go straight to the game
assuming you are talking about how teams are picked
-d teamselection set
-d tempchannels permissionas
You can modify the View Channels permission
Hello! /rolerequirement might not be fully working, I have set it to player role however  spectators without the player role are also able to join the queue
What do you see under "**Role Requirements**" when you use  `/info` ?
tyty
Ahhhh, '@ everyone' was there for some reason. removed it, my bad and thank you!!
Happy to help!
can i remove all leaderboards options and leave only points and mvp?
unfortunately no
So we have a guy who somehow plays hundreds of games every month, and honestly blows people out of the water in the amount of time he puts into it. Because of this, he's been top of the leaderboards for the last 3 months. His record isn't even that good, it's just that the sheer number of games he's playing, he's racking up the mmr.

Is there a way to balance this at all, or am I stuck with pretty much the same guy winning every month?
If his record is positive then he probably just slowly gains MMR
you can try turning off streak multipliers but it probably wont do much
and will hurt other people
That's what I figured. Thanks!
Quick question, wasnt able to find in neatqueue docs - whats the command to change starting rr from 1000 to 0? and also if ppl lose first game, do they stay at 0 or get a negative score
-d starting mmr
they will go negative
you can avoid this if you use
-d mmr minimum
awesome thank you! last thing, streak multiplier - is this enabled by default?
Thank u and i stumbled upon something else:

theres now a 5v5 queue happening, and more people have joined the queue. will it create another match if it reaches 10 before current match is played out?
i feel like theres a setting to allow multiple queues but I am unable to find where that is
It will generate matches no matter if theres already a match going
unless you have /tempchannels  turned off
well actually nvm
it will still work, im dumb
but it will all occur in the same channel
Our leaderboard doesn't seem to be working on the site. Is this just us, or is it a known issue?
https://www.neatqueue.com/lb/Select-11s
looking into it
fixed
how remove this 

and how remove this
how come we cant run commands in our own server
that‚Äôs a different bot
-d teamselection
How do you check to see what happened in a queue
Like what they texted in the queue?
Do you have a staff channel?
-d staffchannel
If u set it, after every match there will be a link to a transcript
Anyone get the fix for interaction failed
the bots clearing queue after games end
automatically
how do i stop it
this is usually cus the bot is slow or down just try again in a few seconds
Is there a way to put a text slow mode on the text channels that the bot creates
also to stop people spamming gay porn gifs
Just do it with the category perms
or just ban them
I think you should solve the problem (people spamming porn) - not patch over it? Lol
this command doesnt exist for me
the actual command is
-d map reshuffle
as for customizing the wording, kinda, you can check out
-d language overrides
one of my queues dissappeared from its channel
is there any way to fix it
without setting it up againo
if the message is gone just do /clearqueue
/ setup does nothing for me
just says Starting Queue Setup!
yes bro this happens in every queue channel
theres so many gay porn gifs
People requeue after their game is complete and the bot struggles to create a new game and takes a super long time. This issue only started to pop up the last few days and is really killing the experience for players in my discord. Is there any fixes or things I can do or change or is this a bigger issue?
<@145305657237700608> it's been 10min im getting same message
it‚Äôs a bigger issue
Do we have an ETA for a fix? I just want to reassure the players in my discord that there's a solution on the way.
I dont mean to pile on I assume you're getting flooded atm
unfortunately i don't know when itll be figured out
Understood. If theres anyway I can help happy to lend a hand.
How do i desactivate the party create command? 
Cause I thought I did but they can still use it
in your server integration settings you can disable any command
How do i do that

Thank u
Could someone please help fix names not showing? I disabled hide names twice no luck.
Its a discord bug, your app does not know who those people are
Thanks for quick response. Any work around?
you can try restarting the app but otherwise not really
Okay thank you! Hopefully they fix that bug one day
The names actually show when you do team selections so that‚Äôs good enough ü§ô
<@145305657237700608> for some reason in our server its saying u can only do 150 games a day and it wont let us queue anymore
yes thats the free tier
er, basic premium tier
how do u upgrade
to premium
<@857633321064595466> premium
> ### How to get premium
> 1) Login at https://www.neatqueue.com
> 2) Click the Dashboard tab
> 3) Select your server
> 4) Purchase credits and/or select a plan
alright
and once its bought how do i redeem it to my server
when i do setup and click yes for temp channels it says interaction failed
its all through the website
bot was updating, try again now
ok and how much will it b e
works now, thank u goat
Yo it won‚Äôt let me select
Even tho I keep tapping on it
if im trying to do a queue where say a team of 4 join the queue as a party and the other side a duo joins and 2 solos, which option should i use?
Do you have the credits?
there is a confirm button below, but looks like the scrolling is messed up
Could be, change the mode to desktop of youre on phone then
will be fixed in a minute
<@145305657237700608> whats the command to disable the autopick player timer during player picks
or is that not a thing yet

but the command doesn't show up
-d timer votes
Ah I can increase the timer
Thank you
_ teamselection reshuffle
-d teamselection reshuffle
Is there a command which allows us to redo the team picks?
After captains chose?
is there a way to make everyones nickname on the server their IGN? easier to add people and see who is who
Nope
Just tell em to put their ign as nickname then
-d ign
-d requireign
I mean yeah, but that ign wont appear on nickname
yea not nickname but it will appear in the final teams message
ok thats good enough as long as they can see it to add each other when the team is set
NeatZ i hope u know ur the goat
Is there an issue with the transcripts? None of mine seem to be loading
Could you link me?
can i make attach roles by mmr for all queues?
Or do they not appear in the message
They're appearing in the message, it's just that they're all spinning circles
https://www.neatqueue.com/transcript/1184332531307384924/10993

Bot is down
<@145305657237700608>
<@145305657237700608> how to send the queue message
and it's down it says interaction failed
exacly
bot its not responding
<@145305657237700608>
How do I put a "ready" button instead of having to enter the call
-d readyup mode
how do i send the queue message
this one
-d forcestart
is that it?
wdym
no i meant
you see the message that has "join queue" "leave queue" and "status" in it
how to send that one
that appears by default if a queue is running
you can use /clearqueue and it will come back
the thing is i deleted it by mistake üíÄ
if that doesn't work, make sure the bot has permissions to send messages
yea then do /clearqueue
alright thank you !
how reset mmr?
I want to reset the mmr of all players
-d managestats reset
How do I stop the queue from auto emptying when a game ends
Like there was a game going and q was 4/8
But when it ended it reset to 0/8
And we ended up with the exact same lobby
if you have tempchannels enabled the queue will be emptied when the match starts
if you have tempchannels disabled the queue will be emptied when teams are picked and the match setup is done
Not possible
<@145305657237700608> for soem odd reason we queued up and got 14 but it didnt work and now we cant queue anymore
just the 14 of us tho

Does this always happen?
been for the pass day
idk whats going on
did you modify the /mmr change?
would be cool if there was a fix paying $20 a month for bot no workü§™
share your config and ill take a look
thats not a default setting
can i deactivate the bets toggle?
wait
this
-d predictions toggle
that description is just wrong, oops
srry
is there a way to allow any person in queue to use /cancel in the temporary queue channel
anyone can use /cancel
in our queues, only mods can use /cancel
Check your server integration settings, thats not how it is by default
someone must have disabled the command
thank you
hey was this ever added? maybe im not looking hard enough but i cant find it in the docs
How do i get detailed results like this
Is there no command to pull up info about a certain queue like `/command queuenumber:22` and it just shows the teams or other info for that match
Nope
how do i remove a certain queue name, the bot is giving me the wrong commands or commands that are not found
Theres not something as removing a queue name, you mean ending it?
-d endq
Dw I sorted it out, thanks for responding tho
Is there a way to auto delete previous messages after the results of a game?
check out
-d tempchannels toggle
new channel for each match which is auto deleted
How do I Pause the queue?
Like for today
I still want it do work tomorrow
I just wanna Pause it for today
what I mean is how the messages highlighted in red can be automatically deleted so it stays only the queue?
<@145305657237700608>
you can‚Äôt, they are only deleted if you use temp channels
you can lock it via /lock if you want
and nobody can join
thank you
Hmmm great idea 
Thanks
Is there a cleaner way to assign autoroles based on leaderboard position? Currently, the #1 player has all seven of these roles instead of just the highest. If not its no biggie but thought I'd ask
not currently, would be good to add though
.suggest Autoroles top players allowing for a range of leaderboard positions
Your suggestion has been submitted to the server staff for review!
Are there any api restrictions on how often the bot can edit member roles? If not the current system is fine
yes there are rate limits to everything
I assumed so, preciate the response
Not sure why but when everyone is kicked out of vc's because the voting at the end of the tdm is finished, everyone that is already in queue that was waiting for the queue/match to finish to get into the next game gets kicked out of the queue. What command is that?

1 sec

It does post in the match-logs channels but also in the same channel as where the queue is in. Do you know how to disable the match results popping in the Queue bot channel?
-d resultschannel
Yes i did this, but the message is still popping in the Queue bot channel f.e.
thats a staff channel message
-d staffchannel
thank you!
is it as well possible to hide the message Player joined queue in the Queue channel?
thats disabled by default
-d message queuemessage history
<@145305657237700608> ty, and i have this 1vs1 queue channel, is it somehow possible to disable the need to join voicechat because the requirement to join a voice chat for a 1vs1 is a bit unnecesary xD
Nvm i already got it
how do i let the bot choose a host at random after all the map selections etc.
-d lobbydetails set
if you click the title and goto the docs, there is an example of exactly that
Ok thanks üôè

Queues seem to be working better. Has the issue been resolved? <@145305657237700608>
Can I set mmr into people usernames? Like [500] qRob
-d ratinginname
<@145305657237700608>
I cant find this command
-d playersub
it takes a 3rd placeholder player to swap players
kinda long method
ill suggest this, i thought it existed cause the bot said it
how do i set the roles that can use the /player ban command?
for some reason, the queue resets basically every single time it fills up, making some people who were already in the queue miss it because they didnt requeue after the queue reset. Why does the queue reset like that?
it's not a timerqueuereset issue like the ai support suggested ^^
what is your queue type?
matchmaking, pugs, etc
pugs
it was matchmaking before but we switched it mid qwueue to pugs because some poeople who were relatively low elo got skipped in the queuing process
also there is an issue with banned players sometimes being able to queue for whatever reason
when you switch queue types it will empty the queue
yes but the issue is that consistently for the past 100 or so queues after we switched it from matchmaking to pugs it has cleared the queue after becoming 8/8 players almost every time
Since with PUGs the queue starts when the queue fills, it shouldnt be possible for "extra" people to join
8 people join, match is created, queue is reset
idk if im explaining it well, it's like the queue is 6/8 and there is 1 queue currently in progress, after the in progress queue ends, the 6/8 fills up to 8/8, but instead of starting a queue, it resets the queue back to 0/8 and everyone who was queued would have to requeue, and as a result many of them are skipped or dont queue in time because they weren't expecting the queue to reset
Could you share your config and Ill take a look (/config save)
that does not sound like it should be happening
do i have to do anything now
nope thx
I tried these steps:
- Fill up a queue with 8 people
- Complete match setup
- Fill up the queue with 6 people
- Vote for the winner of the first match
- Add 2 more people to the queue, and it creates a new match with the 8 people, resetting to 0/8 players
so that seems ok
for some reason ours doesn't create a new one it just kicks everyone from the queue
but i think it's not an issue with kicking but maybe the creation of the queue
Yea thats true
When was the last time it happened
just earlier today
it usually only happens when there is a large amount of traffic
or when people scramble to get into the queue
it happened just now too
twice in a row
Whats your server ID?
how do i check that
1090775052779278377
LOL nvm i go ti
got it
Hey. I can‚Äôt find /mapvotingtime
Can someone help me with this? :)
the correct command would be `/timer votes`
Oh okay thanks
ok, i have a suspicion on whats happening, will have to investigate more though
allg take your time
I accidently deleted leaderboard stats for a Q when trying to seperates stats for mutiple Qs. is there anyway to easily input them back in if I have the results channel saved
depends on what did you do?
honeslty I couldnt really tell you. I used the command to seperate servers stats globally. and then I used /leaderconfigset twice with 2 differnet q names
I assume I just going to have to put them manually back in
If you disabled serverwide stats then you can fix it no problemo
You should go to the old queue and use `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set: player_stats` (it should pop up automatically)
ur the goat
GOATED BOT
player_stats is the default shared stats name
but when you turn off server-wide stats, its no longer used by default
I see
So now that I use it for that Q. if i use another q with a different name it will then start using its own stats correct?
ok thank you so much
a game ended when the bot went offline a few minutes ago, we can't manually set the winner of the game either, is there a way to fix this? <@145305657237700608>
unfortunately you will need to add the stats, i dont think it can recover from it
hey I accidentally added 2 game modes. One has all the maps. The second one is just misspelled. Can I remove the misspelled one with out having to remaking the queue ?
what are the formulas neatqueue uses to calculate mmr gain/loss?
is it possible to add/remove elo fomr someone?
-d mmr add
Its based on mmr variance, https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3qtwvlrw8q
-d mmr variance
what about removing?
Read it again
how do iu change the time to join the vcs
-d lobbychannel timer
how do i add another queue that gives double points
can I have multiple queues share stats but then have one queue with their own stats ?
`/config save` your old queue
`/config load` in a new channel
`/mmr change` in your new queue
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
Thanks
Hey it seems like players in my serv are able to swap to enemy teams voice chat, is there a configuration to prevent this?
Not really, if the channel is not full, then anyone from the match can join
by default the channel permissions only let the players on the team join
Is it new?, i remember no limit abt it
nah the team voice channels always have had special perms
Hello, i want to make a team vs team queue but I wanted to know if it‚Äôs possible to have the Party name in leaderboard and not player ?
Nope, stats are individually tracked
And shown
so I‚Äôll have to overlook my channel / category perms then I suppose, is nothing in the bot I can change this with?
I as admin - I was getting error message during map voting and captain voting for players. I asked, other players did not get any. -> Only as admin I got them

How can I check ‚Äùlogs‚Äù during the voting phase to see what was the error or can you help other way to identify the problem?
Theres not really logs abt voting phase
You have a transcript if u had a staff channel set, but that wont really tell a problem
also any ephemeral messages (private messages in a public channel) wont show in logs
Can you add a list of heros to a queue or have to add individually
individual :/
I am attempting to change the color of the team buttons but the command it is giving me doesnt give me the option to
its telling me to put in /teamselection but when I do it prompts up the teamselectionset command

Hey Team. Think you covered this as a bug. Noticed PC app shows players names fine but Mobile App has majority as #s for name. Is there any settings/instructions to give Mobile users to see all names? Thank you!
Thats discord itself
Thank you for confirming!
Quick question
Let's say there can be only 2 captains in the queue and let's say there is 5 ppl with ``/captian role`` how does the bot choose 2 of them to be captain is it random or by highest points or what?
it would default to your rules set up via /captains selection
by default it will open up a voting menu where you pick how captains should be selected
where the pool of players eligible will only be those with the captains role
Is it possible to have and party queue enabled and a captain pick system? Lets says 2 partys of 3 people join that makes 6 so the other 4 are solo queued? Does the party still stay together and can both parties then only choose from the 4 people who solo queued?
parties are fully supported in normal queues, and people in parties will always be on the same team
Also when the captain pick system is enabled?
Nice ty
Alr, thx
<@145305657237700608> do autorole configs reset when you end a queue?
yes all config resets
Bot its not responding

you can do 1v1s sure
Hi team! Your services have been great and my new server already has active queues. Thank you. 

Question: If a queue fills but someone leaves we currently vote ‚Äútie‚Äù to cancel and queue again but tie impacts people‚Äôs win/loss ratio. Any better ways?
-d cancel
Thanks for reply! But casual members may not know to enter a net queue command I believe? Maybe if cancel could be an option besides tie that would be so awesome. Or possibly make ties not impact W/L. ü§ò
I mean, is not that hard to type /cancel
Shouldnt be a problem
Nope, guess I could leave instructions on the queue so they know. Appreciate the information
<:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
Again D:
yeah its slower than usual
on the server i'm on it's not just slow but it doesn't create lobbies (when the queue gets full it just disappears)
oh god
When setting up a queue, I select NO to the questions about role. But my queue still asks for role, once  the match is ready. Is this the expected behaviour? I don't find a way to not require role on my queue
which message are you referring to? asking for role happens when you join queue
i got somee issue, bcs i can't see any msg from bot
Changed perms?
Thats embed link
Perm
I believe so
make sure you have this enabled
Pretty straight lines
i have this on
i just repair better discord
and everythig is ok
for now
Is there any way to change the formula used for MMR change?
I was curious about what the formula looks like and if we could change it with any admin commands but I didn't find anything in docs
No you cant
Ohh okay thank you, and is there somewhere that shows the formula itself? I'm just curious about how it works mathematically
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3qtwvlrw8q
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=mmr-change-variance
But what are u looking for exactly?
Thank you üôè
I just want to play around with it, this is plenty!
Oh, ok, go for it
Does anybody knows what is the config the tell for how lobby the temporary channels last?
Right after queue is fulfilled and the room is created, people are moved to a channel. This channel I'm talking about.

What I'm trying to achieve is:
Have a queue with size two, once the queue is full, they get moved to a text channel (preferably no voice channel), give people like 15min to Click in the link I'm sending them in this channel. After that the channel could go away.

I'm not doing MMR or anything, I just need to pair people.
Nevermind, ai-support worked like a charm. What a great server!
always nice when the ai is correct
If I save my configs and someone ends queue does that reset all that was saved?
Not everything
configs are never deleted
Hey if players are AFK waiting in the Queue is there a way to remove them? I set timer to 10 second to try and remove but they joined before so it only kicks them after 60 mins, any new players would be 10 seconds.
-d timer afk
Thanks, I set the AFK timer to 15 mins. Looks like you have to wait for them to get removed. Any option to manually kick or vote someone out vs waiting be awesome
is it possible to give specific mmr per role ?
if so how do i do that ?
-d readyup mode
<@1203235376572137473>
Not possible
you can use
-d mmr multiplier set
When I click the little refresh icon on the bottom of the leaderboard, the leaderboard collapsed and won‚Äôt pop back up. I was trying to update it to show the new members that just joined. Any fix?
could you send a screenshot
I clicked üîÑ and it collapsed and won‚Äôt show MMR now
You can always click the link to show the leaderboard in the browser
In case the leaderboard in the discord server wont show
Hello i need help in regards to map voting or map banning even tho we set it up it won't appear when the queue is ready
How do I deal with a Manage Channel permissions error when trying to start a queue? The only way I'm able to resolve it so far is by giving the bot Admin but then it'll bypass restrictions to chat in general chats
The role has Manage Channel permissions and I didn't give NeatQ any other roles so there's nothing conflicting
I figured it out! üï∫
Is there a way to make it so only people with a certain role can be captains?
Or at least it prioritises them as cap
-d captain role
Is it only roles with admin privileges that can be granted access to use admin commands?
I was looking to give a role access to admin commands without them having admin in the server
you can use
-d staffrole
-d staffrole add
Hmmm when I use that the only options it gives me seems to be just the roles with Administrator
It works, thank you ü§ù
I saw the options and wasn't able to scroll so I thought that was it
But I needed to search for it ü§ï
Is there an option to separate calls before map selection is happening?
So that teams can discuss privately
`/voicechannels moveteam when:After Teams Created`
Thanks üëç you guys are actually the best
Maybe my last question for the day, is there a command to delete existing configs? Let's say I made a better config and want to name it something that already exists
I've been struggling with the results channel because it seems to keep reverting to an unintended channel no matter how much I save configs
No, you cant delete configs
Wdym
I try to use the /resultschannel command to set a results channel, but when I load back the saved config it just sends results to another the channel, specifically the one I'm using to start the queue
If that makes any sense
I can use the command and it works fine for every game with that queue so then I save that config, but as soon as I end queue and try to start back the queue with that config it seems to forget
Maybe I don't need to end the queue necessarily, I can probably just keep it up indefinitely right
When u end a queue, the result channel that u set, resets to default (this being the one where the queue is loaded). You dont need to end the queue
Ahhh okay, makes sense now thank you üëç
Was wrestling with that
Also I noticed that the team voice channels created allow unlimited users to join, is there any way to change it so it's capped at the team size?
Just so that players don't hop into the opposing team's call
All that should be by default, unless you have a staffrole or a spectator role set
Ohh okay, I see what you mean
Thank you ü´°
why wont my leaderboard work in the server?
Whats not working
the leaderboard wont show anyone on image
I have people rejoining the server to reset their mmr. Is there a way to fix this?
leaving + rejoining does not change MMR
does it work on the website?
fr? had a few people telling me it did üò≠ my bad
nope no stats are deleted/updated when someone leaves the server
it's still clearing the queue but now it's even more frequent
we just had it happen 4 times in a row without creating a single queue
Wdym clearing the queue
i think its cuz the bot was lagging
is there a way to make one vc for 1v1?
My queue disappear from where supposed to be. We have a specific text channel for the join queue message .It happened yesterday  when we got enough numbers for a game 22 players in our case  one guy didn‚Äôt ready up so queue got deleted we got a message deleting queue in 1 min in that specific time join queue moves to that chat and disappear from our specific text channel . Afterwards I used the command /queue name I select the name of the queue I put when I created to make it appear again . I don‚Äôt want it to happen what I need to change or do maybe was a bug but I really don‚Äôt know just need help
<@145305657237700608>
any way to see who joined the queue by username as admin? like /logs but filter a username that joined
if u have anonymous queue on u can do /info to see players in queue
Hi, is it possible to give Ties a MMR change (e. g. -10 for both players)?
/info is a staff command by default
not currently
also no
Anyone have any idea what this is? I was told it‚Äôs neatqueue but I‚Äôm unable to understand how
That is not neatqueue no
Can neatqueue only have one queue in a channel at a time?
For example:
Is what I‚Äôm trying to replicate and was wondering if something similar is possible üôÇ
yes if you enable /tempchannels
or if team setup is very fast, you can use it without
what happened to the bot guys?
it wont let us click or interact with the bot atm
Also getting the same issue
Looks like neatqueue is down

hey <@145305657237700608> is it posible to download the leaderboards to a csv from website?
<@145305657237700608> how do I set up roles to be added to the queue channels. I want a mod role to be added to all the queue channels created. How do I do that?
Thank you NeatZ for this fantastic bot ü§ù
it would be possible, but currently the website doesnt support that
but thats a very good idea
either via /staffrole, or more manually with /tempchannel permissions
Staffrole grants them access to the /commands no?
I don't want that
you could use /spectatorrole as well
it just lets them see/join channels
no command permissions
Hmm alright thanks
Hi guys, my opponent left and votded his win, but I won. Match 531784
Could you help me out?
Thats something you should say to the admins of your server
Is there anyway currently to get the whole leaderboard?
you can use the API but its not in a row/column structure
can I deactivate this info?
It will show if you have the matchmaking queuetype or anonymous queue enabled
matchmaking‚Ä¶ just 1 vs 1 games, would be a another queuetype better?
thanks for the fast help üòä
matchmaking will help make more fair matches
but if you just want the match to start when 2 people join, then use the PUGs mode
I‚Äôll try out, thanks üëç
yo neat i need your help bcs im making a queue system with ELO can u change the amount of points depending if a player has lost/won a queue

Is neat queue down?
<@145305657237700608> voting seems to be down atm üò¢
seems to be fine for me, what voting
like when 2 people join a queue it shows a layout of the players and the vote who wins
It makes the room, but they cant vote
can u send a screenshot
does /outcome work?
also can you share the config `/config save`
Done!
is it every match being made?
yeah
I locked the queues so nobody can make anymore lobbies
found the issue
will patch in a few minutes and lyk
sweet thanks!
Hi I need help with this, we cant vote and re q somehow
it s all good now ty
try now
Its working
Just tried it
Thanks for the swift work
may I ask how this is possible?
how were teams picked?
balanced
in the clutch academy server if that helps
AI doesnt help üòÖ

Is the mmr multiplier set command (e. g. 1.1)  is for the streak multiplier?
no that‚Äôs a special discord role multiplier
itll give that role a multiplier for when they win
are there any aesthetic customization options? like bot name, color, etc?
you can rename the bot the same way you can nickname anyone

what about the image?
no thats not possible to change
i need your help, when somebody plays 3 matches the bot removes a role how to do so?

Hi üëãüèª Is the ranking #s down for others or is there something I can do to fix on my end? They worked up past few days, seems anyone past 1-10 didn‚Äôt have a rank just ‚ÄúNA‚Äù. Leaderboard site still shows rank number. Thanks for help
It says application did not respond when I'm confirming a substitute request in messages. Is there something I'm missing ?

Thanks for taking a look!
its back
thx for reporting
Fixed quick thank you for doing that! New server with NetQueue on it  is running great ü§ògreat program
How is the points system calculated?
I'm coming across an issue where I set autoroles for MMR, however my highest role for 1000-2000 MMR is causing issues
Every player that seems to not have played a single game is getting this role persistently
I tried to delete this role and try again but the same thing happened
Is there a maximum value I'm passing here that's causing this unexpected result?
I manually removed the role from these players but I'm still unsure why it happened
the default starting MMR is 1000, are they getting that mmr?
I set default to 600
I have autoroles configured like this so far

 ‚Ä¢ @Training [‚ú¶ 0-599] 
  ‚Ä¢ @Apprentice [‚ú¶ 600-699] 
  ‚Ä¢ @Swordsman [‚ú¶ 700-799] 
  ‚Ä¢ @Master [‚ú¶ 800-999] 
  ‚Ä¢ @Grandmaster [‚ú¶ 1000+]
Ohhh wait maybe because because I set the default for the queue configuration but it doesn't apply to outside the scope?
not quite sure what you mean by outside the scope
Sorry I mean that for all the players that didn't play a game yet so would that technically mean whatever settings for the queue I set like starting mmr wouldn't apply to them?
Because the players who played at least 1 game and have stats have their correct roles, it's just the ones that didn't play yet
hii how can i check spefically a queue log it shows me every single change put a want only the Ranked queue clubs 11's
Is there a config/rights possible where I get the Rating in Name as the server owner?
Hey, I am using the bot for queues. But there is a problem. How do I make it so the channels made are not push to talk?
currently the logs are server wide so there isn‚Äôt a way to check per queue
unfortunately no, it‚Äôs not possible for a bot to nickname the server owner
that would be from your category permissions
oh, lol
is there a command to limit how many matches one player can play in one week
oh alright, you should consider it tho
so i cant add a webhook url for every queue?
webhook you can, yes
goood
2 people have similar high mmr (starting 500 and they are both 1450+) yet their winning points are so different from each other. One gains around 25 while the other gains around 40. Is there a reason?
Does win streak give extra points?
Is there an undo option for the last command that I used? <@145305657237700608>
SOrry for the tag
Rather, how do you think I can simulate a good estimate of someone's elo if I have the win/loss right
No there is no undo
you can try using
-d simulate
how can i configure a leaderboard

Thats the normal leadearboard
i now but mi leaderboard see like this
Has anyone played
What if u click the leadearboard title
<@145305657237700608> whys there not a separate timer for team picks and custom voting menus. I want to make it so that team picks have unlimited time and the voting menus are time based.
Just didn't really see the need, but might make sense for that customization
Yeah it does cause usually captains get drafted then picked in our server. So it takes time. It's fine for custom vote menus, but should have a separation.
<@145305657237700608> is there a command for when you reach a certain mmr you cant queue in that channel anymore?
-d mmr requirement
-d role requirement
thanks alot ‚ù§Ô∏è
is there a command where it automatically sets a mmr for you before you queue your first game in a channel? <@145305657237700608>
-d startingmmr
for a queue, can you make a fair match queing system like for example a 1000 mmr can queue up to maximum a 2000mmr player and no one with higher mmr
<@145305657237700608>
no you cant set rules like that, but if you use the matchmaking queue type the matches will be as fair as possible
how fair exactly? like whats the gap
the gap slowly increases as the matchmaking times gets longer
default starting range is 300 and increases by 15 MMR every 15 seconds
-d matchmaking range
wdym by that?
the longer the players have to wait in queue, the larger the matchmaking gap can be
fair enough, so more players can queue if there is really no one fair enough
yea exactly
they might have to wait longer but at least they get a game eventually
sorry for disturbance but the type of queues im making is similar to chess so if u have a certain amount of mmr (which we call ELO) you can get titles like GM, IM exept we do it in a roblox competitive game
so if you have any tips i would really appreciate it
if its a 1v1 i would just do a matchmaking queue
works in 3 queues for different aspects of the game
since u cant do multiple queues in 1channel
is there a command to have it show IGNs instead of discords? or both
<@280841703504478208>
wait thats a good question though
how do i reset the points of all the players in the discord lobby? it says that i omit "/points" and let it be to reset but how does it work?
How do I get the rolequeue command
how do I list the game modes and maps that are currently configured?
hi im having a strange issue
keep getting that over and over
<@145305657237700608> Yooo, keep getting interaction failed when trying to join a queue, you think its overloading?
same
Bot its not responding
‚ÄúThis interaction failed ‚Äú
It happened as soon as I opened up a 128 man tournament.
the bot is not working again <@145305657237700608>
<#919709100114346076>
Are points used for anything outside of predictions and to enter queues?
i set the rolerequirement to a certain role but everyone can still enter the queue
remove the everyone role requirement, that‚Äôs the default value
so everyone can join
aaaa thanks!
I was looking at this game result and am curious about why on the winning team BM5 gained less elo than his teammates despite having the lowest elo in the lobby ü§î
I was thinking maybe because more games played means less change but I don't see that variable in the elo formula
The first 10 games are "placement" matches, and there are also win/loss streak factors
Ahhh I see, so during the placement matches does elo change tend to be higher? Or did I get that backwards
And are win/loss streak factors enabled by default or do I have to enable it myself
starts higher and slowly fades out
yes they are default
Understood thank you
Just curious does the desmos link in the docs give an accurate version of the elo formula or is it missing anything
Would the win/loss streaks just be a multiplier of the entire expression?
yea its more complicated than just a normal equation, not sure if i can represent it via desmos but i probably can
That would be amazing üôè whenever you'd be able to of course
If there's more happening than just the win/loss multiplier I just really want to understand it whenever players ask me questions about certain game results
yea thats fair
I imagine that might be troublesome though if you got like different versions of the formula inside if and else statements üòî
should be doable i think
what is the specific command, when i want to give a specific player an MMR? thanks
anyone getting a message that the bot doesnt have manage channel perms although it has it when they start setup?
<@145305657237700608> my server got raided but no channels were deleted however the bot was kicked do the queus work if i re invite it?
<@145305657237700608> is there a way to add maps in bulk using a delimiter instead of adding maps 1 by 1?
How Remove nick name players in queue?
-d set mmr
no the queues are tied to the specific channel but there will be a config you can load if you check `/config list`
no unfortunately
-d nametype
the queues were still showing even when the bot was kicked in the raid
<@145305657237700608>
ah sorry misread, yea if the channels werent deleted then the queues would still be there
alright so they still function? i invited the bot back
<@145305657237700608>
No, i want , example:
-d anonymousequeue
How do I get the rolequeue command
Like in <#915811627855646730>
-d roles
<@145305657237700608>
Can someone who speaks Turkish help me?
is there a way to do this?
./info
thanks
Just wanted to make sure I understand this command, so let's say I have captains set to be the two highest rated players in the lobby, would this command allow me to choose which of the captains will get to choose first when picking players?
correct
Understood, thank you üëç üëç

how do i reset the mvps leaderboard
how long is your timeout
`/set mvps @everyone 0`
thank u
I got the list of maps from the bot, but it can't find it to remove. Not sure if I'm missing something obvious, but I went ahead with this and it said "Interference removed" while it sill exists in the map list with the /info command
did you refresh?
hi there is anyone form poland who can help me?
or to talk with me for a second
yes, and I reloaded the /info command just in case I did it wrong
is the player/ban endpoint removed?
<@145305657237700608>
no it shouldnt be
well, it should be
but it hasnt been
üëç was just asking because
dont remove pls üôè üôè
https://api.neatqueue.com/docs#/Commands/player_ban_api_v2_player_ban_post
those endpoints should no longer be used
oh theres a v2, didnt see that
yea all commands have an api
https://api.neatqueue.com/docs#/default/banplayer_api_player_ban_post
i was reading this
hi, how can i activate this feature, ai says I have to change readyup mode to the button option but I would like to keep it to vc
the AI lied, but the Ping button enables after 60 seconds
if it is clicked, it will disable and then re-enable after 60 more seconds
does it only work if the pug runner is inside the match?
yea you must be in the match to ping
yo <@145305657237700608>  im going to make a 4v4 queue, i was wondering can you create teams so that random people dont join the queue and its 2 properly organized teams?
you would have to do the "Full Team vs Full Team" queue type
but it will require each team makes a party
what do you mean?
-d queuetype
bcs im doing a mmr type leaderboard with teams
<@145305657237700608>
do `/queuetype` and choose "Full Team vs Full Team". and then people will only be able to join the queue if they are in a full party of 4 players
they can create parties with `/party`
ye but i want to create it so that the lb shows teams with the higest mmr
thats not possible right now, the lb is only individual
dang it
what is the command for stop / ready ?
Is it possible to set opening hours?
15 minutes xd
Is there a way how I can setup a random hero allocation?
Yo, we have had a problem multiple times in the last days and it's that the captians can't ban maps anymore they banned all 6 maps but at the last map the bot stopped working and kept only giving interaction failed message
And without finishing banning maps we can't score the game from <#915813502558556181> because if the map bans are not done there is no message sent in there to close the queue
How could I delete specific queues from my server? The ai bot says to use "/deletequeue" but that is not a command and can't find something for it in the documentation
Endqueue
If we use the command to save a version of the leaderboard for each month, is there any way for us to go back and pull the MVP stats for a specific month? The leaderboard we have via the /link command doesn't appear to be pulling that stat accurately and the MVPs isn't contained on the neatqueue.com leaderboard we see https://www.neatqueue.com/lb/Select-11s
unfortunately MVPs and Points are not currently tracked per-month
"reason" being is that they are not per queue stats, but server wide
i need to give 800mmr to a player what's the command?
`/add mmr`
I have open game that I or the players cant close, neither cancelt or winner select. Bot says ‚Äûcould not find that game‚Äú when clicking the buttons. Any idea? Manually delete the channel, and add the stats to the players?
it says You must specify one of user or role!
<@648635725964902411>
nvm got it
How do I know if I'm still in a queue?
every time a game starts it auto creates a separate queue channel, what command can i use to make that the channel in which you vote for the the winner while having the score displayed in a diffrent channel?
`/resultschannel`
can i create a variable?
like, i wanna gift coins to anyone who participates of the games yk
just like the points
but i already use the points to rank up another thing
Hello i got premium but i can't change the color or the bot's avatar/name or anything
When i change color for the embeds it doesnt change on the /leaderboard or stats
You cant change the colors of the leaderboard or stats
Nope
well the embed color should change for sure
all the messages should be the same color
Im so lost
it doesnt for some reason
and is there's a way a i can get the bot with custom logo and name
Name, you can change it via nickname
Alright if y'all can fix this embed color
cuz it doesnt show for results as well
staff results
leaderboard/stats too
Theres no problem with it
Maybe you just doing som wrong
Or missing something
ye i just tried too, looks fine
how many queues do you get with each plan
<@145305657237700608>
You can check on the site
really i have looked and cannot find it
Dashboard
oh word
sorry for the ping
Well all the plans got unlimited queue, free plan got 3
Is there a way to set it so that players can't use the /ping command to see who's in the queue?
It doesnt work for the leaderboard or stats
Can you help atleast
I used the command correctly
Can u send a screenshot of what u mean?
Is there a way to make it so the queue is only playable with a 5 stack party
the embed color works only for the queues
are they different channels/queues ?
Its tied to the queue config
Do I have to pay to have more than 1 active queue?
no the free tier allows 3 queue channels
not different queues
But its a different channel
it's the same queue
but the leaderboard/stats/results
the embed color
doesnt work on them
while its linked with the queue
It doesn't let me make more than one queue. When I try to make one, the /leaderboard and other commands only show one queue.
I did it on different channels but it still only shows the data from a single queue
You can type in any name you want, the ones that pop up are just existing
<@145305657237700608> seems like I cant get the image url to work when I try to add the queue image
it has to be a direct image URL
Ive done it 100 times lol, for some reason now its not working
<@145305657237700608> This is a direct link right?
hmm appears to be
does it give an error?
No error, just says it‚Äôs not a valid direct link
hmm i see, guess it doesn't account for that format
try using a different website to host the image for now
hmm strange, okay will do!
<@145305657237700608> Why my bot slow
shouldn't premium be faster
That doesnt have to do anything with premium
why its slow
then
restarting rn
can alone please explain how to use this bot... the documentation does a terrible job of giving full details as to what command do, why you'd use them and in what context you should or could use each command.
please tag me in the reply
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
been there... that what i mean.. it is as about as helpful as the instructions on a box of cereal
What cant you figure out? Its literally just read a bit
Create a Queue
Once a queue is created, players will be able to freely start matches at their own will. To start a queue, there are a few options:

You can use the /startqueue command, which will have 3 parameters for a basic queue setup: queuename, team size, and number of teams.

Another command you can use is /setup, which will start an interactive walkthrough to setup your queue.

NeatQueue also supports configuration sharing. You can load up a specific config using /config load, and save your config with /config save
Either `/startqueue` or `/setup`
so what i'm hoping is possible is role granting per team.. example when players are sorted into teams they get a role for that specific role, i managed to find the one for the winning team role.
I dont recall any way to assign roles per team
Closest would be just predefined roles
That youll chose when u join the queue
mmm ok, i will figure out how to set that up, thank you
i dont see a /clearleaderbaord command that <#1131752660740083763> mentioned
good morning, I'm having problems with the rankings, it hasn't awarded any points for two days, the game counts but it doesn't give points... can you help me because we have a tournament on Tuesday evening and the ranking is used to determine the qualifiers for the tournament.... how do I solve it
<@145305657237700608>
To clear.lb youll need to reset eveeyones mmr
any errors? or what do you see
it doesn't add points in the rankings to some players, it counts the matches
Can you screenshot an example and send me a user ID of who its happened to?
it happened to him "ohpukyy", currently when he wins he doesn't give him the points but he counts the match
If you want I invite you to the discord, so you can see everything there
but can players be removed from the ranking? like I would like to remove 5/6 players from the leaderboard, is it possible?
Reset their stats
Or if u wanna like "ban them" from lb
-d leadearboard ignore
I tried using ai support and it did literally no good
it has admin, role has admin on every category
every channel
and all i want to do it replace voice channels with text channels after queueing
and i want to add 1v1 results but i have to do it manually because every time i ask how to do something it gives me a non existent fuking command
yea the ai is pretty bad with that
there can only be 1 text channel per match currently, if you want to disable voice channels do
-d voicechannels teamchannels
it‚Äôll still create the lobby VC by default
Hey bro just curious I want to have a bot like that in my server how you do that ai ?
hi guys im in a 1v1 server that uses neatqueue my mmr of august is 505 and my mmr of september is 469 but on the leaderboard i only see 505 even after i get a win is still stays to 505
Code a bot with that communicates with a ollama model
How come this one server that uses neat queue doesn't have any vcs?
All u do is queue up and it takes u to a text channel
<@145305657237700608>
-d lobbychannel toggle
Got that
And what command makes it so there's a private channel where players can vote?
-d tempchannels toggle
are you looking at the august leaderboard?
nop in *all* leaderboard
<@145305657237700608>
How to sub off someone who left the server
When someone leaves the server, you can't remove them from the player banlist, sub them out, etc because you can't tag their name anymore. He's asking if there's another way to do it
if you can grab their Discord ID you should be able to mention them and use any command still
ex: `<@123456>` <@123456>
a bit hacky, but kinda the only way
Unfortunately not
ok i should be able to fix that part
Hi, which queue type will put all members in queue (8) in to two separate teams of 4?
by completely random*
Pugs
how does this command work?
<@648635725964902411>
what is mean?
How do I give a mod or admin access to the queue chats. The chats that the bot makes when someone joins the queue.
Works along with `/roles`, you chose a role
could you check dms please
Rate limited means there were too much channels created in x time, so it rates limit, can be a bug tho
`/tempchannels permissions set role:`
Thanks for the quick response!
Hello good afternoon, I would like to know how to delete queues so I can create them again as I can only create 3
Just /endqueue
this appears
and when I create a new queue this appears
I can't delete all 3 to create new ones
U need to do /endqueue in the channel where the running queue is
I deleted the discord channel with the queue and even creating another one with the same name nothing happens
it shows the queue name cuz you have stats still for that queue
you would have to use /managestats reset
I managed to delete it, but I still can't create the queue
I have already removed the bot from the server and added it and I still cannot create the queue
That wont do something
Do /serverstats info
And look at the channel queues
I deleted the channels before deleting the queues and this appears now

Queue Channels
‚Å†unknown
‚Å†unknown
‚Å†unknown
Shows the number of players who have queued under each name.
When I click on Queue Channels the message appears that it is from a channel that I do not have access to
I have a config that's set as a 5v5, am i able to change that to 6v6 without having to redo the whole queue?
yes /teamsize
thank u
so it stills thinks the deleted channels have queues in them in seems?
one sec
the name in blue and 'unknown'
when clicked this appears
Because u deleted the channels where the queue were?
Maybe that bugged it
try again now
check the info
disappeared lol
To prevent this from happening, just don't delete the channel that has the queue, right?
remove the queue first and then the channel if I want to do this right?
I mean, if u delete the channel where the queue is, it ends the queue, but looks like sometimes the channel still flaged like if a queue was there, so just endqueue first and delete the channel
I understand, thank you very much for your help and attention. thank you very much. If I have any questions, I'll come back here
yea its supposed to delete the queue automatically when the channel is deleted, will have to look into it
Any chance server owners can see stats of their own server? What days are most active? Times?
Those types of stats nope
Am I safe to run the /startingmmr set command without everyone's elos being set to that starting MMR? I'm not too clear on how this command behaves
How can you make map/mode randomly generated without players picking the mode
What do you mean?
Startingmmr command will just affect new players, thats the elo that they will get when they first queue or you reset stats
Very different from `/set mmr`
Okay I understand, thank you üôè
I just wanted to double check
I had used this command improperly before and it messed everyone's elos up
Specifically when I set the starting mmr to a @Ranked role
how do you remove this?
Remove what
queue activity
you can‚Äôt
is there an option for side selection, like if captain 1 picks player first then captain 2 can pick which side theyd like to start on?
is there an option to make the leaderboard show discord usernames instead of nicknames?
Nope
Nope
thanks man
I wanted to know if there is a way to start queue 1 again. example: I played 5 games and 5 queues were created, the next game will be in queue 6. I would like to know if there is a way to make the next game be in queue 1, if I want to start again from scratch
Here I am on line 6, is there a way to delete the lines and go back to 1?
no those numbers are unique per server, you cant reset
I understand, thanks man
Bot down right now?
was lagging a bit behind, its back though
ah perf, all good
Greetings, first of all, I installed the system, but as team 1 team 2 team gk, I want there to be 3 buttons like the one below, how do I do it? <@145305657237700608>
This bot is acting really stupid
I need help
yes?
sorry i‚Äôm not understanding
I see theirs a hero ban option but am i able to make it so players can pick what hero to play kinda how you can ban them
There's a guy in our server that scrapes the data out of the queue channel and compiles it into stats. Times, days, maps played etc.
You can turn on server insights to show you this
In server settings
hello, i added map and captain and when we  join que captain random, no  voting and map dont voting only taking players and game start..
<#1131752660740083763>
i want to make it so only one role can create parties
but the /partyqueue command isn‚Äôt a thing
i go to send message and it auto fills to /partyqueue maxsize
<@145305657237700608> how to make it so that everyone starts with 300 default mmr
is there a command to manually deduct a specific amount of mmr?
-d startingmmr set
-d add mmr
thanks
how does someone end up with negative points betting on predictions?
how to setup the bot to host scrims

<@145305657237700608> yoo, getting this error when trying to update the queue
nvm, 10th time worked lmao
hi, i need help.
How to put a website leaderboard, inside a discord server room?
-d leaderboard
I would like to develop a bot similar to this that allows me to open a website where there is a ranking and be able to scroll through it from the discord room
thats not possible
Does /outcome cancel also revert the stats gained/loss for that game?
Like MMR and everything
Nevermind, got it!
I just asked AI Support on how to see a list of maps in a queue, When trying to use the /map list command, it doesn't show up. Am I missing something?
itll show in /info
how can i change the leadeboard and results channel embed color i linked both of them to the queue and nothing i want it green like the queue channel
hey yall! how do I setup the buttons to report match result?
I've seen this in a server and wanted to replicate. Does this requires extra configuration?
ah yea this doesn't work with linking, i need to fix it
that should be by default
hmm after I ran /setup I didnt get it in the private room. I'll try to tweak a little bit more üôÇ
got it! thanks <@145305657237700608>
it seems i needed to join voice <:hehe:915209554202095636>
is it possible to remove this "Are the team valid?"

I'm doing 1:1 matchmaking, I've setup 2 teams with 1 person and set the team assignment to Random
-d teamselection reshuffle
Is there a way to make the queue notify you when someone has queued? Because I have the queue fixed in a read only channel
But then won't know who queued unless constantly waching the queue
you can try enabling
-d message queuemessage history
but can you redirect this so a specific channel or will it default to the queue channel
only the queue channel
why does this happen
make sure the bot has permissions to send messages
Is there a no elo loss command?
in what sense
A command that reverts the elo loss for the losing team
But the winning team keeps their elo gain
Bot its not responding
‚ÄúThis interaction failed ‚Äú
by naming both queues "lobby 1" in the setup, will both of them be linked to the same queue? with same stats, results, leaderboards and settings ? or there is another way to duplicate and link both queues
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
<@145305657237700608> any chance that you got to the feature regarding specific map and mode combination orders?
How can I unlink my old discord account that I cant acces
Just asking about this, and if it was ever fixed. I can add it as a suggestion if you'd like.
<@145305657237700608> is there a command to disable the winner voting menu
so that only staff can score games through staff detailed results
`/message winnermessage results value:Staff Only` might be your answer. Not 100% sure though
Ill try it
It works
Added the ratinginname thing to a different server but they want to be able to hide their elo
i wonder if theres a command for that
All i see is admin commands which work on the whole server
yes plz add it
do you mean hide it for a specific person?
Like lets say im not staff
Im a normal player
The ELO is in prefix format, but i want to hide it from my name. I just want my name to be shown, no ELO
no you can‚Äôt toggle it off per person really
unless you just make it so the bot can‚Äôt nickname that person via permissions
how do i set up a 5v5 with captains where the captains pick players each one by one
with elo
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
i said end queue and i wasnt able to get the queue back
any advice?
when you end queue it should give you a config code, or check /config list
and use /config load
This works now. Just tried it by removing a person we had banned. Thanks!
how do i make it tart
Hello guys, any chance how i can to add me in leaderboard without any game played? Im admin of queue
Add yourself games, prolly the only way
i want to put only to join without voice what command is for do it <@648635725964902411>
and how can i put that if one player stays more than 10 minutes or x minutes after that the bot will kick from the queue?
`/queueentry methods`
Thanks but don't working üò¶
How to off this hidden, i need to know nickname
is there a way to hide prediction amounts? feature request?
You cant hide that i believe so
Uhm you sure you dont have more reqs to show on leadearboard?
I dont think u can hide it
how do I disable this inactivity removing me from the queue, I‚Äôve tried the /timer afk, by increasing the time (which doesn‚Äôt have any effect) and by removing it entirely (which doesn‚Äôt work)
-d timer queuereset
the afk timer is per-player
well, I‚Äôm the person inputting it, and it happens to me
but I see, ty, hopefully using this instead will help
is possible that players vote in different channel to the queue channel <@145305657237700608> ?
to the team that wins
or <@648635725964902411>
only if you use
-d tempchannels toggle
but either way the votes will happen wherever the match is setup
ye, when the match is done i say
like the match results? move them to a different channel?
ye that when the match starts
the vote to decide who win
is apart from in other temporary channel or in a specified channel that i said
the vote will appear in the same channel as the setup
<@145305657237700608> and how can i put a cancel button
for players
because players maybe have lag issues in game and decide to cancel it
Just do /cancel
but i want to put the button panel to all games <@648635725964902411>
not only for one
and 5 players/8 accept it
Thats not gonna work if u have temp channels
Aswell button would get lost if u didnt have temp channels
`/cancel` will start a votement quickly i dont see a big deal
i prefer that appears, because that break the streak
But the answer is that you cant put a button to generate for all games individually
ye, is that
but if the admin must put the cancel manually it break the streak if people play other matches
i just put if is possible to add in features <@648635725964902411>
Nono
Players can use /cancel
The admin command is /outcome cancel
ok i will try it
ok thx i will inform it
that possible?
Hi, Is it possible to pay for premium by paypal?
<@145305657237700608>
not via the website but i can help you out manually, unfortunately i can‚Äôt do so until sunday though
Is it ok if I dm you on sunday to do that?
sure
yeah üò¶
already paid on the website with the help of a friend, thanks anyway, and thanks for the bot, it's pretty good
Bot its not responding
‚ÄúThis interaction failed ‚Äú
Just keep trying
bot lagging?
bot is still unresponsive to my server as well
<@145305657237700608>
Discord API is having big problems
It‚Äôs very frustrating paying for this bot for our server when it has long stretches of not working like this
understandable but we are often at the limits of discord itself
looks like they say it‚Äôs been resolved
Understood, very frustrating of discord then
We most need neatqueue on Friday afternoons and I‚Äôve been getting pinged all day from players having trouble
usually i would send out a message in announcements but wasn‚Äôt around in time
whats the command to change max call size
<@145305657237700608>
is there a command to effect mmr gains/loses for a game where someone accidently clicked disable mmr after the game is already over?
Hey is there a way of upgrading the premium plan, I just joined the professional plan but I haven't read that it limits to 1000 games a day. I might need double as much, I have 20 credits spare in the account but I need another 40 to move from professional to enterprisee
I can't configure roles staff.
I have the role neatqueue admin, but the commands don't appear to me.
I already tried deleting the role and creating it again, but it didn't work.
Nope
If u want to avoid this just disable that possibility
`/mmr change allow_disable`
You can talk to neatz i guess, he'll help you
I have all the commands allowed and I also have default access to all the commands (all this in a role) but when I have the role it does not appear or allow me to use a single NeatQueue command
if you switch plans it will upgrade automatically
like it will calculate the refund for the previous plan and apply it to the new one
if the commands don‚Äôt appear at all that would be a permissions issue
check your Use Application Commands permissions
same thing here ^ commands being hidden would be related to permissions, not the bot
Got it, just to confirm. So I got the professional plan for 20 credits, I need more 40 Credits to upgrade to enterprise and once I upgrade I receive a pro-rated refund in credits.
those permissions are activated
The commands work, but only the user commands, the staff commands that are not working
Juan and I are together trying to solve a problem on the same server
When I have that role, with all permissions activated, not even the commands appear
yo tbn tengo ese error con mi pc no aparecen los comandos, solo lo puedo manejar desde el celular

<@145305657237700608> what costs the elo premium? we cant find the site to check how costs
basic premium is 5 credits, you can check the price on the website if you goto a servers dashboard
ok thanks
I need some help I tried to do an elo system in my discord and ended up with a negative number at the starting point
did you change the starting mmr?
by default there is nothing preventing MMR from going negative
Yea I did would you recommended just leaving it the way it is ?
yea i think the defaults work well enough
my next question would be fastest way to reset it
probably just end the queue and make a new one
<@145305657237700608> Ran a 100 person tournament, bot handled it nicely, ran into 1 issue where the players would get matched vs the same person on discord again, but on the bracket they get moved forward.
Overall just wanted to let you know it went really good
awesome to hear, thx for the info
wdym they get matched vs the same person?
like the match is duplicated, but bracket looks fine?
exactly yeah, they get a room created on discord with the same opponent they just beat
But on the bracket it looks like they get pushed to the next round, but what ends up happening is they start playing and get the loss from the real round when it starts
<@145305657237700608> how do i restart a bot because its lagging
why does the bot seem to be experiencing ‚Äúinteraction failed‚Äù a lot lately when trying commands or queuing up
same
and i have the best plan
You cant
Also it doesnt have to do anything with the plan
Its just for everyone
That it lags
seems to be working again
thank god. i‚Äôve tried so many bots and this has always been my favorite one
how do i remove a queue
-d endqueue
I chose the wrong Premier server and paid after charging the credit, can I change the server? bought it today
and i bought the "5.67 credits" product, how can I use it?
<@145305657237700608>
oh i see, plz DM me the server ID
I need some help with `/api/v2/selectwinner` https://api.neatqueue.com/docs#/Commands/outcome_selectwinner_api_v2_outcome_selectwinner_post

I calling the API like this:
```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.neatqueue.com/api/v2/selectwinner \
  --header 'Authorization: <REDACTED>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"channel_id": 1287870121196523581,"match_number": 2250,"team_num": 0}'
```

And I'm getting the values out of the `TEAMS_CREATED` webhook payload, but I'm always getting 404 `{"detail":"Not Found"}`.

I tried passing the values as strings, and the bot (https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/1131752660740083763/1288010233842761758) said to omit the "channel_id" field, but it's also not working. Any idea what could be wrong?
Does anyone has any clue why I'm getting added to every channel neaetqueue is creating? I think it's some misconfiguration on my end
how to add a referee role, so that the captain cannot choose this referee for his team
is <#1287870121196523581> a valid channel on your end when this happens?
Thats not possible
Yep, that's the confusing part to me. I have an automation that sends a message to the channel with information about the match. And the message goes trough, if I use the same channel ID to call the API it returns 404. So I wonder if the format is correct should it be `1287870121196523581` or `"1287870121196523581"` or ???

I tried both and it didn't work
I also verifies if it's the same ID I get from discord
I wondere if there's anything to do with the reserved channels, I think the bot is reusing channel ids
yea that‚Äôs ok the channels should be reused
i‚Äôll have to take a look myself
the channel should just indicate which channel to use the command in
can you explain how someone ends up with negative points
mmr or points?
<@145305657237700608>
when a queue pops how do i make it so players dont have to join a voice channel
just automatically starts instead
either change the /readyup mode or disable /lobbychannels
i want to set the autoroles for the top 3 players, the top 1 work but the top 2 and 3 dont get the role
is there anyway to remove the two queues I made as tests from the leaderboard. When someone types /leaderboard, I don't want the bottom two to show up as options
I tried doing what the ai suggested but it was only to clear the data from them, not entirely erase them from being searchable
Is there a way to make the line graph in /stats display points based on, say, every 10 games played instead of based on date?
Atm it looks silly for people who played a lot, took 2 months off and then came back. There's a giant flat line in the middle with tons of datapoints crammed in on the left and right side.
the queues will show if there are any player stats for that queue
you can use /managestats reset
what did you try? It says "at rank 2" so it doesn't seem like a range
interesting idea, not currently, but i can see that being annoying
i feel like even just per-game might be better?
Yep, that's the confusing part to me. I
-d autoroles leaderboardposition set
you need to set the lower_value and upper_value if you want a range
for top 3, lower_value is 1, upper_value is 3
or are you doing separate roles for each rank?
that exactly
i tried lower_value 2 upper 2 and also dont work
only thing I can think of is that the bot can't assign that role
due to permissions, also make sure that the bot's role is placed above the autoroles in Discord's role hierarchy
the bot has admin permission and was already able to give the role to the top 1 so I don't see why it couldn't give the other roles
my queue doesnt give anymore points to the players that hit 70
thanks, I used the /managestats reset all and then selected the name and that worked
mmr maximum didnt chage anything ^^
points or MMR?
like it doesnt raise their mmr anymore even after a win when they hit 70 <@145305657237700608>
can you save the config and share

Hello does anyone know how I can make a call of duty 8s queue. I keep messing it up
Hi there, wondering if someone can help me please. I've set-up a queue but wanting to create different queues for different channels within my server but it keeps overwriting between both? Help appreciated
That would be cool too! Anything to tie it to games themselves and not to dates.
why the points have so much decimals?
uh oh
thats not right
fix coming up
How can i put that players that have less than 600 points or X points wont join to the queue to play? <@145305657237700608> , the ai says that is with dodge, but dodge only sanction when they dont come to voice
i try to add decimals with . or , and it does not work
is solved that not answer it
<@145305657237700608> theres a thing where the bot dms you ‚Äúyou are already in the queue!‚Äù If you unmute/mute your mic
is that a bug or is that intended, want to disable it
hi, i want to know if i can boost x players when they win x match, for example you win 30.0 mmr points and with boost 1.1 are 33 points (is an example, do 30x1.1)
only with x players
do you have the join VC to join queue feature?
if so, then that sounds like a bug
-d mmr multiplier
Hey guys!
Quick question:
Is it possible to remove the response from the bot when you for example join the queue? I mean the APP-response which is private.
which response exactly?
These:
hmm yea those are probably not needed
they only show in the matchmaking queue type
but they should really only show if anonymous queue is enabled
So, anyway to remove them when anon queue is disabled?
We have mm type on
not right now, i‚Äôll remove it though
there‚Äôs no need for the message if you can see yourself get removed from the queue
how do i delete it when the queue starts?
i want to disable it
-d captains reshuffle
thank u
Hey! Another quick question:
we‚Äôve set up the leaderboard in a channel and it‚Äôs showing there correctly but it‚Äôs not updating automatically (on the website it updates).
Is there a way to make it update? I saw the schedule command but that‚Äôs only once every day if I understood correctly right?
it should get updated after every game
quick question is it possible to make a point system for diffrent rankes?
so like one rank would win 50 mmr and lose 50 while another wins 25 and loses 50
And if it doesn‚Äôt, what might be configured wrong?
theres not really an specific for that, but you could play with mmr multipliers by role, you would set an autorole for mmr ranges, then set some mmr multipliers for that roles
-d autorole mmr
-d multiplier mmr set
hmm if it refreshes on the website idk tbh, could be some weird bug, with discord
if u click the refresh button on the lb, does it change
hey uh whats the cmd to set the default mmr
whenever u join
-d starting mmr
is there a 3v1 setting
for the bot
No it doesn‚Äôt change when you refresh on the embedded leaderboard. Hmm
Just noticed now that no buttons work with the lb. Not even switch page or stat to show. It blinks a milisecond but then stays on the same page/result.
Something is defintily wrong
Hmm, then, delete that lb, re create it
Or try it with another channel
Might be working now, mightve been a role restriction problem, even though the bot didnt output any error message.
I created a new channel and gave the bot all of the permissions and now it works to change the page.
Is it possible to show autoroles on the leaderboard btw?
For example we have a bronze, silver, gold system for different elo, could their tiers be shown on the leaderboard?
Nope
That would be shown on /stats
I'm not able to formulate my question properly so the bot understands me this time, but our server is getting quite busy. And often people don't vote for the winner and we end up having channels open for a long time.
I'm programatically closing them by interacting with the API, but is there a built in way of closing those after a given time? either cancelling the match or given the victory to the one person that voted, doesn't really matter that much
-d timer matchcleanup
Default is 90 minutes
that should be it, Thank you!
is there a command to reset the the queues only? without changing the stats and settings
Then what are you resetting?
the queue number
Ah thats not possible
btw, how do I buy the premium?
<@857633321064595466> premium
> ### How to get premium
> 1) Login at https://www.neatqueue.com
> 2) Click the Dashboard tab
> 3) Select your server
> 4) Purchase credits and/or select a plan
I might have fkd up.. 
I accidently purged the channel with the queue. Managed to get it back up using the config load.
Now the leaderboard is blank and doesnt update. what happened?
I guess the link between them got removed, but even with a link command it doesnt work
or share stats serverwide
did you load the correct config?
btw if the queue message is gone you can just use /clearqueue
Yes! Altough i had some minor adjustments since it wasnt the latest config.
the autoroles and everything is still there. But cannot find the old leaderboard and the new queue seemed to have reset the leaderboard completly
So now i did a game in test mode with only me in it and the leaderboard updates as usual but all of the old stats are gone...
Surely the data is still there and its just something ive done wrong right? please :/
yes, whats your server ID?
is it possible to add a cancel vote?
instead of /cancel
Nope
I figured it out. The stats were saved to player_stats and not the name of the queue. sorry for troubling you xD
is it normal to get negative points when you predict üòÖ im broke üò≠
uhhh you should lose points but not go negative really
hi i wanna know can know which premiumj membership will allow me to get the bot customizaiton like the own bot with own name and av
<@648635725964902411>
Theres not option for that
You can change bot's name with a nickname
uhhh
thats more than a normal amount i would think
if i lose all my points should i get an automatic reward +100 or +50 points any mercy compensation. because if i have -5k points how can i predict again <:sadcat:1179569615911800842>
you gain points for playing by default
is there a command to disable votecancel to players?
you can disable it via server integrations, searching for the command
and disabling it for a role
aaaa yesyes thanks
i think you can make a requirement that the winner needs to be voted on before they can requeue a game
<@648635725964902411> the mmr decay feature, does it work as a multiplier?
or is it like a stable percentage or value for a specific time period?
its a set amount every time
thx, fixed
so if i set 25 rr decay, and a duration of 2 days, it'll deduct 25 rr every 2 days?
is there a way to undo?
i added decay and it deducted everyones mmr
i thought the decay would start from the moment i entered the command
it would decay anyone who hasn't played in 2 days
no theres no undo
im just trying to make a team system for people to group up to do a dungeon in a game, is there a way to do that?
How do I make an embed to join the queue?
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
What do I click
I can't find anything there that talks about embeds other than embed color
if you start a queue it will show up
I started a queue but I can't find it
Hey!
We've set autoroles for different mmr ratings on our server, but it doesn't update automatically. What could be wrong here?
(when we do the command it sets the roles, but after a couple of games it doesn't change..)
like you are saying it just stops updating?
yes, people who should get promoted over for example 1500 elo are still stuck with their old role, even though the autoroles are set
Is the bot placed higher in the role hierarchy than all the autoroles?
in the discord role settings
when captains are banning maps, i would like to see neatqueue mentioned one captain first before the vote, and then other so i will see who's banning first and second, exist any command to make who can ban maps first and second? ü§î
i selected captains can only ban maps but i don't see the order when they're banning maps
Is there a way to reconfigure the bot to give each match +10 points for win and -10 for lose starting from 0 points?
Points or mmr?
by points i meant mmr
also i don't want them to be influenced by win or lose
So you want mmr from 0, and win 10 and lose 10 per match
-d starting mmr
And mmr changet set has a static option
exactly
thanks <@648635725964902411> it worked perfectly <:11658pepepray:1284477135364296747>
How can I make it so I don't have to vote on that site when I wanna see the leaderboard?
you just have to vote 1 time per month
or get premium
Hello
Can I have some assistance
By somebody who knows how to set this bot up?
<@145305657237700608>
is the `autoroles games set` command for lifetime or will the games played be reset monthly similar to the leaderboard
This was the issue! Thank you so much!
can anyone confirm this?
if you have monthly stats then it will track the monthly games
whatever shows on the leaderboard
any reason the graph isn't updating, player is 965 MMR
it shows the peak for the day i believe
yeah the peak was over 24 hours ago
How can i set the bot to give a role such as ‚ÄúTop 3‚Äù to the 3 players that are on top of leaderboard and that it also changes the roles when another person is in that position
-d autoroles leaderboardposition
How do i enter the command for Top 3 players and Top 10 players?
Like the format
Why can anyone on the server connect to the team's channels without being a member of the team?
Who can help me set up my neat queue bot in my server I can possibly pay you DM me.
Mostly assume team channels are full
By the team
So no one can join
Basic guide on channel's topic
What?
<@648635725964902411>
Where‚Äôs that?
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
i have reset server stats, but the auto roles  based on games played still remain
any idea on how i can reset the roles, or automate it?
hmm yea if the stats are gone, the bot won't even look at those players...
do i manually remove roles from all players then?
and then setup auto roles again?
<@145305657237700608>
also what time zone is the bot in
asking so i know when the monthly leaderboard resets
if it‚Äôs not too many people that‚Äôs the easiest
or delete the role
-d timezone
fair, did that
bot down?
frozen
Any luck with this?
Sorry for ping, didn't mean to do that
looking now, np
how do i remove queue inactivity
<@145305657237700608>
how do i remove queue inactivity time
thoughts?

-d timer afkreset
How do i fix double picks by the captains? So first captain picks 1 and second should also pick 1 instead of 2

Is there a way to make an auto queue select 2 random people automatically and put them together in a new text channel
That is so, so much better. Thank you much for taking the time!
perfect, will release it either later today or tomorrow morning
why this is happening?
sometimes it shows the leaderboard and sometimes its like bugged or idk
how do i disable all team selections
all i want is it to auto queue people then be able to close it
and how do i disable the messages that send when a match is completed
Is it possible to remove names from the scoreboard or not?
and if so how?
<@145305657237700608>
better with dates because it shows progress over time
it‚Äôll be a config
default to dates (like now), but can swap to be per game
i pretty much always avoid changing default behavior
are you considering sharing an embed for the ban command?
wdym
for example when i use player ban command
only i can see this
it's my bot, i meant this one
What all does fleep do
same as neat
but not working properly
im still using neat
no there isn't any posted message like that
how do i add it to my server that it fully works ? Ive invited the bot to my server made a seperate chat chat for it is that all i have to do?
just run /setup now
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
how to fix my map bans, i selected only captains can ban one map and select one map also...selecting maps by captains is ok because only appears each name of the captain while they're voting but, in map bans both names appear at the same time
-d map bans
enable per_team
how do i disable the cooldown when i want to check stats
U cant
why tho
i cant check stats then? xD
You just have to wait
It's important to note that the decay process is triggered whenever the player's stats are fetched, so if the player's stats are not checked for the entire week, the decay will not occur until the stats are fetched. If you need further assistance or have more specific questions, feel free to ask in the <#868549627652214794> channel for more detailed help.
is this true
i assumed the mmr decay would be automatic
`/leaderboardconfig weekly` i cant see this command on the server or in the documentation
How do I look at the results when I put in place a queue-entry survey?
Where is it stored?
it is automatic, thats just the implementation
only via the API currently
<@145305657237700608>  what about this
no thats not a command
its only monthly as an option
i see, could you please look into the ai bot, so many times ive been provided a command that has left my head scratching
yea im not quite sure why it makes them up so often
Oh boy, alr ty
how do i disable this message
this is a private message from the bot
-d matchstart dmplayers
How can I change how long a player has to vote in map selection
-d timer votes
hello, im using the NeatQueue bot and it looks different from what I saw, how can I config the bot to look like that?
If that‚Äôs NeatQueue then i would be impressed, i‚Äôm not sure how they did that
it actually is, so its more something they did instead of some native configuration?
yea looks like they have hooked up something themselves possibly using the API
i need to talk to whoever set this up lol
oh i see, so they probably got a bot that calls NeatQueue API to handle picks, bans and the queue
in a more interative way
gotta build my own then and do the same, thanks!
Thats acc crazy
Hi, our server owner created a new category for our ranked section and moved the channels into this category.
Our queues have disappeared and we can no longer use any neatqueue commands without this error:
We've given the bot the permissions it had in this ranked category, but no dice.
Any ideas what we should do?
check the category perms?
something must be different?
Yeah, that must be it. I told our owner to do so but he says they're the same. He's checking again.
Thank you for responding so quickly
Also, thanks for shrinking the dots, /stats looks even better now
np! i agree it looks better for sure
Everything is back to normal. We're now still getting the same error, but only in the match channel created by the bot when the queue fills.
We figured it out. Our server's anti-spam bot was blocking Neatqueue's permissions...
is there a way to have 2 separate queues in 2 separate channels, where one of them has role restrictions?
yes, you can either hide the channel with permissions or use
-d rolerequirement add
will this create 2 different leaderboards?
<@857633321064595466> stats

How exactly does the dodge command work?
without voice channel thing?
it won't work without the VC
so will you bring this feature in the future?
im not sure how, it requires some check to see if players are there when the match starts
i don't think it is very difficult, we tried this with several developers
also same for ban things
this bot is really good
but it has its shortcomings
Im not sure what you mean
ror example, when using the reroll command it reorders the same maps
the dodge penalty applies when the players don't ready  up for the match
i meant dodge command
like
if i use ./dodge command
bot will ban me from queues
and the match is will be canceled
yes thats how it works currently
its just working with vc
i guess
without any command, so i mean about joining vc or not
or if you use ready up buttons
this command is used more after everything is completed ( team selection and map ban phase )
it would be really good to have a dodge command in there by writing
like to cancel the match?
both
-d cancel
if i use dodge command i will be banned from queues
ik that command
same like that
im not quite sure what you are looking for
hey, is there any way to give a role for the selected captains for a queue?
and when the queue is finished it removes from them
Setting up a new queue for the first time in a while. Anybody know off the top of their head what command changed the language from "Players in Queue: 0" to "Queue 0/2"
I know this wasn't a language override, but I'm not sure what command I had used to change this originally.
-d queuetype
left is Matchmaking, right is PUGs
ohhh ok
I set minimum points to 0, but players still go negative
Alright, we've been having a similar problem for the past couple of hours. We tried adding a third queue channel (we have two that work currently). We made it by duplicating an existing queue channel that works, then running /setup and setting everything up just the same (as far as I know). The private tempchannels that this new 3rd queue creates seem identical to the tempchannels created by the other 2 queues, but the new one gives the "Permissions Error: Manage Channels." But from what we can tell, the channels are set up identically in every way.
Any ideas on why only tempchannels created by this new third channel would get this error?
Perms errors are just related to your server config
is there a way to not allow players to queue until the winner is officially decided?
-d requeue condition
Do i select winner? if people are actively in a match does it update or do I have to wait until they are no longer in a match for it to update? Because I have people voting for a winner then joining queue will their match is still going on.
Winner selected
thank you
how long does it take to update the graph for when you change the stats view from dates to games?
should be instantly
that‚Äôs the limit of games, not the x axis
it‚Äôs still showing a limit of 30 games
-d statsconfig xaxis
how can i fix "in a day" thing?
-d lobby timer
thanks
is there a way to export the leaderboard in a csv or something?
you can fetch the data via the API but otherwise no not currently
So my people with staff role can edit the channels that the bot creates but other than that they cant edit anything not even the channels in that same category how can i remove their perm to do that if its bot related?
so the staff role is only for NeatQueue, so it will only give them power to do things to stuff regarding the bot
you should create a normal moderator or admin role in Discord it sounds like
queue didnt give mmr even tho we have it set up
maybe the players voted to disable mmr
if you have that option enabled
they wont be happy when i tell them üíÄ its 100% the reason
yea might wanna disable that option
people sneakily disable mmr
Nothing comes up after this what do I do
Check if u have embed messages enables
It‚Äôs enabled
Its the same with this, doesn‚Äôt work
bot probably doesn't have permission to send messages
it does
i redid it like 3 times, making sure it has all the perms
i even tried configs and nothing comes us
every time ive seen this issue it has been due to permissions issues
Can I show you
is there a built in rank system? how does that work
-d autoroles
-d autoroles mmr
didn't know the bot would DM everyone in the server due to autoroles üíÄ
is there a way to disable that dming feature?
-d autoroles notify
Hey guys, im extremely new to having my own discord and im trying to set this up but i feel like im not doing this right at all.
is there any video on to how to properly set this up
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
not sure what's causing it but been running into instances of the queue hanging and then people can join/leave and the picks do not run and multiple lobbies end up opening
Hello,
How do I allow a particular role to view the voice channel created by the bot? (not the VC chat or let them join) I want them to only be able to see that people are joining the Queue VC, but they can only access the channels if they actually join the queue.
I used the 
`/voicechannel permissions set role:@role_name permission:View Channel value:Allow` command before but seems like it doesn't work even if i allow the role to view channels
help the bro
Fixed, i just had to search it in the server thanks
What about Top 10 from 4 to 10?

Feature request incoming
Sorry, I added this to my channel and can't remember how to do it again. I'm creating new queues and I'd like to set something like this up.

Basically to have a channel when people can click on Show My Stats to see their stats
how does /register
work
im tryna do a siege tm server
I have a bot that is using the neatqueue API to run commands, and for some reason it keeps changing every day or two days or so - what could be causing this? I don't think anyone is running the generate tokens command
what changes
you can create a second channel and /link it to your queue
and use /commandbutton stats  to send a button which players can just click
you would use /requireregister Rainbow 6 if you want players to link their accounts to fetch their rating
instead of everyone starting at the same MMR
dodge autoban goes for who left queue when already started? because said when they don't join voice  channel
itll only apply to people who don't "ready up" for a match
depending on the config, either joining the lobby VC or clicking the "ready up" button
the token changes and I am no longer able to use commands through the external bot without resetting the token
is it linked to your account?
I used the `/autoroles leaderboardposition` command 
And i messed it up

Basically now after every win or lose it sends messages to top 10 or top 3

It sends 2 messages at a time

Role Added ‚úÖ
`For being in rank range 4 to 10 for mmr in **Community Matchmaking | Forward Assault**`
Role Removed‚ùå
`For falling out of Peak MMR rank range 4 to 10 in **Community Matchmaking | Forward Assault**`


Seems like this happened when i used the command 
/autoroles leadboardpostion role: Top 3 mode: PeakMMR lower_value: 1, upper_value: 3

Just like that Top 10 role but lower_value : 4 and upper_value : 10

it messed up and now spams messages in dms after every win or lose for Top 3 or Top 10 positions in the leadboard
are you using the same role for multiple conditions?
they are probably clashing
What do you exactly mean by multiple conditions
There are two roles
Top 3 which is for 1st PeakMMR to 3rd PeakMMR

Top 10 which is for 4th to 10th PeakMMR
looks like the Top 10 role is being used for checking Rank and Peak MMR
based on the screenshot
I'll analyse and let you know
Anything particular perm you want me to check or fix?
no nothing permissions related
if you check your /info itll show the autoroles
you can't use the same role for multiple autoroles usually
I'll see
<@145305657237700608> is it possible to generate an api token without an api key
through /api/v2/webhooks/generatetoken
no not really
the tokens are linked to your discord account, so without an API key to start it won't know who to generate the token for
thats how the bot knows if you have permissions to use each of the commands (or API endpoints)
you could however call that generatetoken API using your existing token
the issue is
after a day of using the same api token, it just doesnt work
everything works as normal and then i get 422's everywhere in the consol
i thought there was just a staff fing with the /webhook .... command but turns out nobody did anything
it just randomly decides to stop working
<@145305657237700608> sorry for the pings but any possible workarounds?
a 422 wouldnt be caused by an invalid token
you would get a 401
quick question, how do you make it so that when queue is full and starts the players are given a role that is removed after it ends?
-d autoroles ingame
mb its a 403/401/forbidden
im just trying to find a way to generate a token without a currently working token
i don't think you will find a way
but the token shouldnt be expiring or getting replaced, at least not on my end
ill check to be sure though
next time it breaks we can also compare to see if the token changed
Is there a way to refresh the bot when the queue breaks because of party errors
like it's stuck right now
party errors?
if a part of 3 joins vs 3 solo queues and the solo q are captains then they can't pick
oh thats interesting, thats a bug i hadn't thought of
nobody had mentioned it before either, ill look into fixing it
but if that happens you need to cancel the match and retry
So this is the issue I am having.

In the server I run the bot, I had a general queue in which anyone can play. We ran over 200 queues in this system so stats have been pretty much defined. I then added another channel for a separate queue (let's call this Lower Queue) that is role specific. I disabled ``sharedstats serverwide`` however when players queued a game in the general queue, their original stats are not updated and instead their base MMR was reset and they are gaining initial placement MMR. I cannot find where these stats are pointing to. I want the original stats updated.
you need to re-sync the general queue stats
use /leaderboardconfig sharedstats set: player_stats, it should pop up
when you disable server wide stats then everything detached from the global server stats
So how do I go about keeping the Lower Queue stats separated? (No queues have been ran on that so far)
if you disabled serverwide stats then you are good
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
How do I do this? 
If I run ``/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set: player_stats`` in the primary queue channel, then the games from that queue will go back to updating the original stats?

this happens every ~12-32 hours
yea this is definitely not the token for your account
Is it possible to assign players to a team as admin once the queue pops?
how to set up a channel with only a queue
A channel can only have one queue
Why would i use my discord token and not the token i got from /webhook‚Ä¶.? unless there‚Äôs something im missing
The token you generate is linked to your account
1 token per user
the bot creating channels
Yes, that token just doesn‚Äôt work 12-32 hours after using it tho
and how to remove voice channels
that you need to join voice chat to start the game
-d readyup
Even tho you mentioned there is no expiration date for tokens somewhere here
yea i can see your token was regenerated
its not the same one you posted
this
I just answered you
can you have the results from 2 separate queues point to the same channel?
doesn't seem to be working for the 2nd queue, so just curious
-d resultschannel
It won't let me login
Everytime I hit login on the site, it doesn't update with anything new
Just a continous loop of me able to hit login
no one can vote on a winner ( interaction failed ) i tried manually making team 2 win and im getting ''The application did not respond''
bot offline?
bot not showing in members list and not working
<@145305657237700608>
yeah seems bot is down for us too
el bot se cayo?
si :(
<@145305657237700608> bot restarted at least 5 times in the last minute
bot online but not working for me
Do they notify you here when the bot is working again?
everything is back
I would have to wait a few minutes, right? I see that the bot is working but it is very slow.
everythings good on my end, wonder if discord is acting up
we got a weird duplicate queue now
either the bot is slow or discord acting up
gives me interaction failed
5 sec later
pops me into queue
For now, I closed the queues, I don't want any errors to happen while the bot is running badly.
makes sense
We're getting rate limited now. I assume this is per server though
Kinda a bad error message, but its caused by <#919709100114346076>
the bot tries to create the match, discord is too slow to respond, so the bot gives up and shows that "Rate Limit" message
I see thanks, is there a command to clean things up once discord is back?
We're having a lot of channels being "blocked"
funny matchmaking these days
hi, the bot keeps saying interaction failed, runs incredibly slow and delayed, processes so long, it will say messaged failed to deliver and then register ages later. any help?

whats the best way to reset all neatqueue setting of my server without deleting it?
usually just end the queues via /endqueue and then /managestats reset all
how can i remove in partyqueue because when i press yes it keeps asking the same and more than 2 attempts
basically i want a random map after 2 bans by captins in the partyqueue and then they get a randomize message 2 times
-d gamemode reshuffle
isn't reshuffle is the reroll feature?
to change map?
lol it's fixed, thanks
it applies to gamemodes, maps, teams etc, anything random
Can you help me with my issue?

<@145305657237700608> is it possible to add something like a message to the queue embed?
-d message queuemessage
you can set a custom footer
or use /language overrides to change any text anywhere
can u please tell me how to add a message as a reminder for the footer? i mean which command specifically
np i added but how can i remove that message after add, i cant send the command without any value
np i handled, thanks üòÑ
how the rematch works, i enabled for the queue and nothing happened after we voted for the winner and enabled in the game itself and same
Guys anyone can help me? since the "Voting menu" is not available?
you will see a Rematch button on the results message
not sure what you mean
how to make only captains vote for it
because it requires everyone's vote in the queue
i tried /captains drafttype straight but didnt work
-d votingmenu add
yeah but nothing here about rematch
there is an eligible voters option
looks complicated can you please help and tell me how to setup it?
im sorry for not being clear but the match wont end cos the "outcome result menu" wont show up
i tried `/votingmenu add title:"Rematch Vote" options:"Yes,No" key:"rematch" team_voting:true repeat:1 eligible_voters:"captain" options_variable:"none" number_of_votes:1 allow_random:false force_random:false button_colors:"blurple,red" show_numbers:true order:1` and didn't work i don't know how to set it up, please let me know how to do it and make only captains votes required for the rematch button
Is it possible to apply the auto roles only to those who have queued and not everyone in the server?
autoroles will only modify players who are ‚Äúin the system‚Äù
meaning they have at least joined the queue once
unless you set everyone to a set MMR
<@145305657237700608> can you answer me?
i‚Äôm not sure what your question is
is it possible to make only captains vote for this? because it requires everyone's vote and i want only captains vote for rematch to make it easier
is it possible to generate a restricted api key that can't perform admin actions and only look at stats?
not currently
alright
thank you
is there any way to do the ban message public?
i cant find the command
Bc theres not any command like that
how can i setup it ?
Not an option to achieve what u want
so , cant setup a ban channel?
and i dont mean button for banlist command
Thanks
how can i make a voice channel into queue and then when its full it automatically picks a captains and then once the captains chose 3 ppl they get sragged into another team vc
-d queueentry method
how can i reset everything ive done
hello
<@145305657237700608> i had a question regarding queues
normally when a queue starts, it should open a private channel with the voting and allat
for some reason it doesnt do that
ai isnt helpful so best of 3 thing wont work and once you vote for one thing it just ends the queue
You should just play the best of 3 and vote for the overall winner
When your queue starts, does it create a seperate channel for voting
not sure what you mean, like a queue channel?
-d tempchannels toggle
will it be in the future so you can choose the result?
like 2-1
or 2-0
Ah so I do this?
because i swear i do and it just doesn't work üò≠
also is there a way to skip like the voting? for example, after a queue is full, it automatically puts peoples in teams
like randomize
is there a specific command to skip the voting
whats the command for that
to skip voting
lemme pull it up rq
-d teamselection set
Im running a server with both Unite and SIege players and trying to keep the leaderboards/MMRs seperate, in doing so I dont think the individual leaderboards are updating right. Is there something Im missing?
When I tell the leaderboard to pull from the specific que it gets it right, but it cannot make a proper URL for it and if I refresh it, it goes back to the original broken form
Are your two leadearboards separated and linked with each queue channel correctly?
I doubt it-
How would I go about properly linking and seperating?
if you have 2 queues and check the leaderboard in each, are they different ?
I thought so, I made sure people with the Unite roles couldnt show up on the Siege ones. But I did that with the command. So I would believe its all the same leaderboard
okay, next question then. How do I set up different leader boards? I thought they would set up with different que names and whatnot
If not serverwide stats enabled, thats how it should be
Do 2 channels for each lb, link the channel to some queue, run in the linked channel for queue 1 for example /leaderboard, on the second linked channel for queue 2 run /leadearboard, they should be different
If u wanna quick see the lbs, do what neatz said
I feel like Im going insane. The leaderboard is showing one thing but the bot is pulling the MMR from what I assume is the serve wide one? Which I did disable but Im just burning braincells here
the same channel?
is there a way i can rename a queue without the stats getting affected?
surely either the leaderboard is old (not refreshed), or the match was old
-d leaderboardconfig sharedstats set

<@145305657237700608> hello, is it possible to prevent players with @Muted role to send messages in temp channels?
i disallowed the role to send messages but user overrides reversing it, is there a solution for it ? <@145305657237700608>
Just in case you guys are not aware:
<#992610856904957992> hasn't caught yet
Backonline it seems üòÑ
It‚Äôs discord api again
is the bot down?
seems to be discord
aint no way
<@145305657237700608> is it possible?
Could I get someone to hop into my server to look closer at my situation? I cant figure it out and cant figure how to describe it.
hmm i would think that if they have a role which denies it then they cant chat
i might be wrong though
yeah you're right
it can be done by /tempchannel permissions user: @user....etc if you can add it
<@145305657237700608> Please? Im so lost lol
Just try to explain
Its almost as if there are two ques feeding into one channel. The leaderboard is not accurately tracking MMR even though in the staff channel it IS tracking them properly but its not updating into the leaderboards at all. Mind you its been a day or so since a match has happened.
For example, one of my players is 2-3 and has 1004 mmr. The bot know its, but its only showing 0-1 and 933 mmr on the leaderboard.
Is there a way to block a certain in-queue role from being able to be joined via requeue priority?

For example, having someone with reqeue priority joining as a GK can ruin it for those without priority, as there are only 2 spots for them.

I don't think there is, but wanted to check first.
Are the stats shared server-wide or nah
Nah, I did turn that off after it started tho. I made sure it didnt include those in the new leaderboard
You can invite me and I can take a look. I'm hoping to be free in about an hour or so
how did this happen
do we reset his stats and manually add the mmr?
or deduct the difference?
<@145305657237700608> what's happening here
<@145305657237700608> any answer?
either someone set their MMR really low or they having a low starting MMR or something
for what
our default was same as the bot: 1000
also are there any plans for a white label solution anytime soon?
for this
If what I said doesnt work, then no
what does this mean
Custom bot per server
i need someone
to help me
please üôÇ
you would have to be a little more precise
like how saphire provides, with custom bot pfp and personalization options
Hello
I need some help with this message : 
NeatQueue You must vote for Queue#50846 to enter a new queue!

I find the queue in my messages, but there is no way to vote..

Please help
is there a way to change the min required games to show up on only the winrate leaderboard and not the leaderboard completely
you should see that match channel?
it's ok Edu helped me
Thanks
<@145305657237700608> is possible to clear the queue numbering?.. for example, i had 5 queues and they were all canceled cuz testing the functionality
Nope
hi is it possible to delete maps you have added? i tried ot remove incline and what not but its not working

In test mode (unsure about normal mode) it is auto banning me for not joining voice channel within like 5-10 secs, how do I either remove this or extend it? (Or is this only an issue in test mode?). Ai support suggested ‚Äú/voicechannels mode‚Äù but that command doesn‚Äôt exist ?
In test mode, when u activate it, you can see it says:
So yeah, its a short timer
You can disable autoban
`/dodge autoban duration:0`

hello, how can we disable people to type in the channel where team picking is going on?
what's the command for it?
<@145305657237700608>
Just change the permission of the text channel so no one can send a message
but there's a new text channel everytime for a new queue
It does not.
Currently got map and gamemode voting setup where it goes team by team on a best of 3. However when it goes to game 3. I wouldn‚Äôt want the first team to be able to choose the decider map AND mode, final map &mode should be either random or team 1 picks map, team 2 picks gamemode?
Is there a way to change this?
you can use
-d tempchannels permissions set
they should delete when the match is finished (a winner is picked)
good point, currently no but i will revisit the logic for how it decides who votes
idk I have to keep manually deleting them
they just stick
No problem, my workaround making it a best of 2 then just adding an extra 2 voting menus, one for team 1 (map) and one for team 2 (mode).
is there a winner selected?
can you share the config
`/config save`
yeah winner gets selected

Hi folks, when setting up a tournament section. I‚Äôm currently on test mode & it‚Äôs automatically creating matches for me, which is great, but only doing it match by match and not starting all the matches in that round at the same time.

hii is not anyway i can check the amount of mvps a player get
im trying to do a reward with money involved for the player that get more mvps every month i know it can give extra mmr but is somehow possible to have like a leadeboard or know the number of mvps per player
the leaderboard has a dropdown for MVPs
yeah i didnt see it sorry last thing i want to ask is about the api is possible that someone can join queue on my website and with the api and user already sign in can join queue from the website
i know a way to authorize discord to sign in in my website
yea you can use the API to add someone to join
but is through discord they need to log in discord or they dont need it
i will have a button join queue in my website
You will certainly need the players id whos clicking that
i would definitely use discord oauth at some point in the process
ehh does anyone know how to remove/clear all games played from a user? and how to give lower "staff" roles perms?

When I interact with a queue I don't see anything. For example when I join the queue nothing visible changes. This is what it looks like when I have joined a queue (attachment). Also cannot see leaderboards, etc. Problem occurs in web app (Firefox) on Android app and on desktop app (OSX). Am I missing a permission or something? I've tried in multiple different servers
Check if the bot has enabled embed links
How can I do this? I am not admin
Oh, so its just for your pov that looks like that?
Then im not sure
Yeh, as far as I can tell, when I checked the help video for the server showing how to use the queue, my pov looks very different
I'm assuming its something to do with my Discord account settings as it's not app or server specific
can anyone help me i want to make it so that if a player goes below a the elo in there rank the get there changed when there elo changes to that rank
Can u see the queues in this server?

Hi folks, we do 4v4 team vs team games in our server. We have set up ‚Äúparties‚Äù so we have our teams setup, however we tend to have teams up to 6/7 as often not everyone is on at the same time.

What is the best way to deal with this?

Ideally we‚Äôd want all of the team to be able to join the queue but only 4 people can play one map at a time & it‚Äôs a best of 3? Normally in say map 2, maybe 2 people will spawn out and our subs will spawn in.

Any idea how to manage that with this bot? Or do we just increase team sizes to the same as party sizes and people get points regardless if they spawn in or not?
yea i would have the team size match the party size
Yeah probs easiest solution. Also out of curiosity. What is the purpose of /substitute or /player sub I wondered if that was going to aid with that conundrum. Was going to test what it does tomorrow
it‚Äôs to substitute a player in/out of the match
anyone can use /substitute to sub themselves out, while /player sub is a staff command to force a substitution
So if there is a queue of 8 and the game has started, they can use that command and someone from outside of the queue can take their place, or does it happen within the queue? <@145305657237700608>
usually it would be someone outside the queue
would really love to have a weekly leaderboard, not  sure how tough it would be to add
The bot is down??
not fully, i believe there is minor outages rn
I was preparing a wingman queue üò¢

It is down for me as well. Where can I find the server info to post it?
how long will the bot be down
its down for me too
the queue functionality is fine so you should still be able to play
nope, people cant leave or join queue or use commands here
no team or captain voting as well
I only see Lorcanito having issues, not any other servers atm
Does removing the bot and just reinviting fix the interaction issue?
burger tms, server id: 943730662471512064

<@252284693263679498> No it doesnt, Or it didnt for me at least
Ahhh, seems like a Discord issue, multiple bot developers reporting it
I would expect an update from Discord soon
yea i keep watching the api status page
cuz on my side everything is fine
Sounds good
Appreciate you guys being so responsive
miss you king
<@145305657237700608> I reset the bot hoping that would allow a quick fix. Do you know if this will cause the MMR that has been acquired to reset?
Miss you too LY!!
you cant reset the bot üëÄ
Like removed and re added
thats not resetting
and wont do anything tho, so rn looks its on discord
I didnt know what to call it lol
Just wait out discord

is the bot glitching? can't report score, says "match not found" even with mod commands
Yea Discord has been bugging out a bit
Okay next question for all you smart people if the queue was deleted while the bot was down is there anyway to retrieve it. Im trying to give mmr to a team that won but cant make a decision on the game since the queue was deleted
<@145305657237700608>
no you are likely out of luck for that match
okay thank you
is there a way of changing this message? We don't use voice channels and people often get confused
-d matchstart dmplayers
ill update that message though, it shouldnt mention a voice channel if it doesn't exist lol
One more question, We now changed tempchannels to threads and it's working great. All the mods are being invited to each, would it be `/tempchannels permissions set` deny ? This behaviour was not presence in the channels temporary channels
yea the only way to invite a role to a thread is by mentioning them, so that‚Äôs why it does that
currently no way to disable for threads
would have to either remove the staff role or go back to text channels
If I remove the staff role, would they still be able to correct match results?
if they have the manage channels permission, yes
hi /ratinginname doesnt wortk
hi guys how show mmr behind name ?
-d /ratinginname format
-d ratinginname toggle
don can you say dms how set ? with format ?
Is anyone available?
the bot is gone from the channel, the person who runs it isn't available rn so I'm not sure what the commands are to redo it
<@648635725964902411> <@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608>
Wdym by the bot is gone from the channel?
like it automatically started new queues after the game had been full
but this one didn't autopopulate or it had and it crashed
i'm not sure, I wasn't actively in the channel
There is no queue channel and the bot won't create a new queue am i right?
There is a queue channel
There was an active queue
and then it disappeared while waiting for other players to join
You can /cancel queues
In the queue channel
Or did the queue embed for joining and leaving disappear?
the queue embed for joining and leaving disappeared, i believe
i didn't set up the bot so i dont know all the how to's and the guy who did is MIA
An admin ended the queue, probably
Or there's a bug idk about
use /clearqueue
the message should come back
thank you!
When using the command button to invite a player to a party, can we not use discord names to invite them? It‚Äôs asking for a number?
how do i link multiple queues into the same channel so i can see all leaderboards in the same channel
rn i can only see one leaderboard which is the one i have linked
If not. Is it possible to create a command to fetch the id?
It‚Äôs just nobody will have developer mod me setup to fetch ids so will make the command button parties commands unlikely to ever be used
hmmmm thats a good point
<@145305657237700608> is there a max amount of games limit? two games going on in my discord and now tghere are more than 10 people in queue

ty! regardless, i haven't hit 50 games today yet but there are not more than the max amount of players (10) required to be in queue
any idea about that?
also i tried making separate queue channels and then one queue jumped from one channel to the other LMAO
not sure what you mean
do u wanna join my discord and see
perchance
basically there's supposed to be
10 players per team but there are now 11 players in queue
-d queuetype
you want PUGs then
do pugs have elo?
are leaderboard separate based on queue?
like multiple leaderboards?
yeah
yea you can different ones for different queues
beast
do u know how i can set that? i've tried /leaderboardconfig shared serverwide thing but it still shows two separate queues on the same leaderboard
Did you have the queue made before you ran the server wide command
is that why
Most likely
Lmk if you need help
how do i refresh a leaderboard in a queue its updating
Like when you run the leaderboard cmd and press the refresh button? Or like reset the player stats for a queue
running the leaderboard command shows an old version of the leaderboard
most recent game log and then when i use the leaderboard just now
technically those 1100 people should be on there right
<@896624546990411826> saw u join the cord haha u want perms?
No I‚Äôm good
I‚Äôm not staff for neat queue I just use it a lot
And help out
any idea of the leaderboard thing?
Those are the same queues?
theres only 1 queue
at least i think
is there anyway to see separate queue leaderboards
if there were any
Not a singular cmd for it, the data on games update after results are set so I don‚Äôt see why your leaderboard is off
Try running the outcome cmd
Do /outcome select winner then for that queue 31 put team 2
team is already marked as winner
Just change it to team 1 and see if leaderboard updates then you can always put it back to team 2
dont think it changed anything
Those games are for that queue right your sure
yeah same channel same everything
I just got off work so I‚Äôll be on my computer here in 10 and can help you
lmaoo im heading to work rn
but uh idk what i just did but it semesd to work
i might just reset mmr
Yea there is merge options so we‚Äôll figure it out
welp i just ran reset all and it didnt reset the leaderboardd
you probably have 2 different queues with separate stats
if you check /info on the MMR page it shows the name its using for linking stats

Btw you can put it in test mode then join queue yourself 10 times to make sure it works
how do i do that :o
Look in your discord
its lit ty <@896624546990411826>

new api?
looks like its down
hmmm
<@145305657237700608> it was down for a bit but its back up with a new error
```diff

somehow the host's date + time completely got desynced... no clue
should be starting itself up shortly
Idk why but when i join a queue it instantly ban me before the 10 minute even finish for not joining the channel
you are probably in test mode
ok so it‚Äôs only in test mod
its back
nice, thanks
read the message when u do `/test`
7 hours ago?
how do we purchase the premium version?
is there a way for autoroles to not assign a rank to everyone in the server and only those who queue? like I have people who join the server and are immediately assigned an auto role
Can I reset the queue number to 0?
With Bo6 Coming out I was looking for a way to set it to start from 0, if I remove the bot and re add it will it go to 0?
no that wont do anything either
match numbers are unique per server for identifcation purposes
still not resolved?
How do you set top players.. as in a #1 overall rank
is there any way to check the bot audit log, like queue changes from other admins?
btw ai support its not working üò¶

how to turn off voting?
i just want random captains.
no voting

Just tried again, worked!
Is there a way to stop the queue voice channel from forming? Not the team one the one called ‚ÄúQueue#1194‚Äù
this cmd ^
someone didnt vote for which team won and i deleted it now when  that person tries to join it says they need to vote but its gone
ive tried restarting nothing works
no matter what ive done it still says u need to vote for queue#
use /outcome
thx it worked
How do I rename an existing queue? Using `/queuename` doesnt seem to work
that would work but the stats won‚Äôt show the same
you can use /leaderboardconfig sharedstats and set it to the old name
or enable serverwide stats
i have them linked to a dummy queue that controls the name of the leaderboard, but i cant get the other queue names to change
you have perms its <#1179629156133244948> if you wanted to try
wdym can‚Äôt get them to change
regardless of what i try to name it, i get the same error
uhhh
works for me lol, what do you want me to name it
also remember how stats are stored by default if that matters
ZooMafia BO6 HP Matchmaking
and <#1179851881590304961> ZooMafia BO6 SnD Matchmaking
if you could
can‚Äôt send messages
oh my bad
oh i thought matchmaking was part of it, i guess its ZooMafia BO6 HP and matchmaking is auto added by the bot

yea i should‚Äôve known better lmao
i knew Queue was added but I forgot about Matchmaking haha

can i make a leaderboard with only team names?
Hello üôÇ

I would like to add a functionality to the bot but I am not sure it's possible, could you please help me ?

Is it possible to include a surrender vote that works this way: 
During a match,
1st half: 4 votes required to surrender
2nd half: 3 votes required to surrender

Thank you
nope
for some reason when i go to setup bot it send this but nothing to setup
i have problems with selection winner i can't see buttons i configured to show up voting after 1200 seconds and staff only can vote, 2 votes max to select winner
./timer winnervotemessage seconds:1200 .
could someone help get the system running for me? dm if possible i hve my own server.
./timer winnervotemessage seconds:SECONDS - isn't showing up (i selected 1200 seconds)
ok now i selected  /message winner message pin and sticky Enabled
Can i have 3 separate queues linked to 1 leaderboard?
did not work! <:thisisfine:1128496721052307456> <:sadcat:1179569615911800842>
Hi guys, I would like to know how I can assign mmr points to a player who was not in the queue and made a complete for the team. Could anyone help me?
-d add mmr
Yes, but the queues will need to share stats, so it will be same stats for every queue
Thank you brother üëç
i didnt get it how can i make it share stats?

so if server shared state serverwide is enabled i can have 3 different queue names with the same stats?
like if i made a queue with the name "2v2 and another queue with the name "4v4 can i make them share the same stats and points
If u enable server wide, all your queues, even if the names are not the same, will shate stats
it give me 1 queue option to name the leaderboard to
I think this would work using the ‚Äússerverwide‚Äù command so long as you don‚Äôt have any other queues outside of that that you don‚Äôt want to include.

But if you had say 2 different games eg rocket league & call of duty. Then you couldn‚Äôt use ‚Äúserverwide‚Äù you‚Äôd had to use ‚Äúset‚Äù and the problem with that (I think) is that you would have to call the queues the same name to share the stats, but I don‚Äôt think you can configure them differently? So if you changed the queue configuration to something different, it would change the config of all the queues with the same name?
For example you have one queue named X, this queue has some stats, if in the serverwide name parameter u give the name X, then the stats being saved in that queue now will be applied to all queues, then all queues will share stats
But can you have two different configurations when you have named them the same queue name?
Config doesnt have to do anything with stats
Like say you had one channel named 2v2 & another 4v4 and gave them the same queue name so they share stats. Can you configure them differently
<@648635725964902411>
even if the queues are in different channels? like i create a chat with the name 2v2 and another chat with the name 4v4 and i want them to share stats
Yes he just answered that
Yeah, they will share across the server
didnt read it sorry
thanks
All good, just create 2 channels, 2v2, 4v4 and give them same queue name and that should do the job bro
im trying to make a queue where you can join and match into other players and adds them both to a ticket and then nothing else happens
and u cant see who elese is in the queue u cant se their nammme
you prob have your queuetype set to `matchmaking`
-d queuetype
you prob want PUGs/Normal
ah, you want that (?
i figured this out
whats the diff
matchmaking will wait till there are some amount of players that are in a similar MMR range to start the game
PUGs will start when the queue is full
so no mmr or anything
because i dont need the mmr system
theres still mmr
but like
is there a way to just
disable the mmr system
you can set it so no one wins or lose mmr
-d mmr change
`/mmr change set amount:0 loser_mmr:0 static:True` you can do this
oooh ok but
with pugs/normal
regardless of mmr
will people still queue into each other
ok bet
one more thing
do u know how to make it so that like
after the bot makes the channel and adds the two people that queued into
it just
doesnt do anything elese
if its a 1v1 use `/teamselection set` and pick the Balanced team mode
and it will skip team setup
wait
how do i remove the thing
where it asks players to join the vc for the queue channel
-d lobbychannel toggle
We've had multiple instances where the bot is recycling text and voice channels that are being used by another queue, even when there are multiple reserve channels available. <@145305657237700608>
Actually change multiple instances to this is happening a lot üò≠
Not the best example since it's a VC but:
like it takes a channel thats currently being used?
yep, but not always
sometimes it doesnt even delete the contents of the channel, there will just be two queues in the same text channel
sometimes it does delete the contents, and sometimes also clears  the voice channel
Here's an example that's from like right now
what happened to 50038 ?
they're still in game, this time it did not kick them from their VCs
oh so both games are somehow using the same text channel
correct
its <#1300537076751536280>
looks like this time neither queue affected the other at all, they're just sharing a text channel
but like i said it's not always like this, sometimes the VCs are affected
im looking into it
when the first match votes the second match wont be able to
i would assume
yeah that would explain the 'error' that ive been getting pinged for all day, they all say "my channel disappeared and i cant vote for the winner so i cant queue again"
Is there a way to clear all parties in the server? Like complete refresh? <@145305657237700608>
how do i get rid of the join vc thing after two players queue into each other
so the bot is very barebones
it lit just makes the ticket
and thats it
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/857677776471588894/1300361625315835935 

Any solution for this ?
Wouldnt it be better to get a ticket bot (?
To disable it run
`/readyup mode mode:Disabled`
How could u get a queue with ticket bit
you cant login?
use `/lobbychannel toggle` if you want to fully remove the channel
no :/
All good just checking
Also, I locked all the queues last night and let every existing match end, and gave the bot a 'break' for like an hour, started them all back up and we havent had an issue yet.
<:prayge:901494445550235688>
Yeah as soon as i login using discord auth it just returns to the main screen.
u mean the vc channel
or just both the vc channel and also the regular 1
Can i make the leaderboard only have mmr option
how do i make it so that after  fight is over when players vote for a winner, it doesnt actually count until an admin approves of it and then it counts the win
also how to make it so it doesnt post results for every fight
I may have found a bug. I'm not for sure. When the queue goes to draft, a captian can tap the button to draft a keeper, then next round type the number in to pick the other keeper, making their team have 12 players, and the other team have 10 players and no keeper.
that would be just the VC
-d winnermessage results
it will always send to the `/resultschannel`, just make it a hidden channel if you dont wanna see
that sounds strange
also if you dont want the queue to show as player_stats, use `/leaderboard sharedstats set name:player_stats`, then you can choose whatever `/queuename` you want
Agreed. Is there anything I could do on my end to stop that?
no but ill try and see if i can replicate it
Hey i still cant login to the site, Although at the 21st it was okay <:sadcat:1179569615911800842>
Can someone explain how to rename a Leaderboard?
i somehow dont get it.. I linked two Leaderboards, but i need to rename them because one is named gctf 3v3 and other one is gctf 2v2 and i would like to name it just the gctf leaderboard
You cant link 2 lbs and have 2 lbs on a same channel
Also, the leadeaboard its just pulling all from the queue, so it will be the name of your queue
Okaay well i know :D I linked 2v2 and 3v3 leaderboard together but i cant rename them because it will be the name of the queue

u see the normal "Queue vc"
thats the default one
when it gets 10/10
new queue vc is created
where the captains pick players
but it is not auto matically moving players from queue vc to new game id queue vc
which it did before
but some1 messed up cmds today
so wht is cmd to set it to auto move ppl to new vc again?
-d lobbychannel pullall
gawd
thnks
Do players auto join the queue when joining the VC?
i have set it to either
u can click n join
and auto vc joins queue too
I made the starting mmr ar 300 mmr points but for some reason me and my friend are at 1000 starter
And the 3 games he won it just 50-52 points per game
Did u queue before set starting mmr
For me yes, and I‚Äôve reset everything but he never
can i lower someone mmr?
check your /info to verify the starting MMR
but you can use `/set mmr` to manually change it for someone
Do I need to enable topplayers role? I think it may be broken
how do we make it so muted players cant talk in bot created channels
Is there a way to change the permissions of specific roles in the newly created queue channels? Like our server had a "muted" role but they can still talk in the new queue channels. Is there a way to change this through the bot?
once you set it up it should just work
as long as the bot can manage roles
I dont even have the option to enable it
-d tempchannels permissions set
-d voicechannels permissions set
wdym enable it
did you add one?
I do the auto roles topplayers and it doesnt popultate for me to select anything
oh the command was changed
-d autoroles leaderboardposition set
Did the command for Setelo All change as well?
i tried to do @.everyone to with the temp channels command to set evryone to default and deny and it buth doesnt work

Hey <@145305657237700608> its prob. not possible to not be able to queue again and again against the same person? i got a 1v1 queue and i dont want them be able to farm somehow
theres nothing that prevents people from matching up multiple times
so nothing i could possibly to against that right?
only thing really is
-d anticheat flag streak
monitor if someone is going on crazy win/loss streaks
so how that works? I saw that but couldnt really get into it :D
-d anticheat channel
just set a channel, enable that flag, and itll work
it sends a message if someone gets flagged
Whats the command to show someone is looking for game in the queue
thank you
the anticheat channel is automatically for all queues?
help?
is there a way to remove or set roles that can connect to vc's that are auto-made by the bot?
When the bot creates the team call, how do I set a player limit?
The queue he disappeared from the channel so players can join how do I get it back showing
The player limit is the teamsize
Type in the chat of the queue
It should pop up agaim
hello, is there away to skip this menu and make it auto select enable mmr and random teams?
Is there a way to make the queue only usuable at certain times? for example between 6pm - 12 am is the only time the queue will be open?
-d schedule time
-d teamselection
Set it to random
Hey that didn‚Äôt work for us I tried resetting the bot too, should I invite it again
What did u do then?
It wont magically dissapear
Hey, i got mmr change on 25. Now i saw the issue that a player with for example 500 MMR only losese 30 MMR to a 250 MMR player how to fix that?
i mean so the person with lower mmr gets more from a 500 player and the 500 mmr player loses more
-d mmr variance
Yea, but how do i need to change that for my problem that i wrote? i dont  get it tbh sry..üò¨ maybe someone could tell me :x
im using the /managestats reset mmr command but it isnt resetting the leaderboard
'/channel name queuenotempty'
Can someone explain this command
Not sure what‚Äôs going on. Asking for neat queue to setup and it shows that it is but never actually does anything. Help?
the bot will rename the channel when the queue is not empty
make sure the bot has permissions to send messages
it had all permissions but it's fixed now thank you
<@145305657237700608>
are you using the command in the queue channel?
<@145305657237700608> sub command is bugged
it works sometimes and sometimes not
it just keep the same player in his team and add him to the other team instead of replacing
Ok so, is it possible that if anyone who queues get a permanent role? I want that because i dont want keep @everyoning when a player or 2 are missing in queue, so i would like to have a role to @ that playes the queue
you can use autoroles and assign a role for all players
for example set a ‚Äúgames‚Äù autorole for anyone who has played 0 games
bot down?
<@145305657237700608> you there?
yea bot also down for me
the bot just stopped working in my server
is this happening to anyone else
same
back now
Hey its me again!
So i asked the AI-Support about my Problem that High MMR Players(500 MMR) gain way to much MMR from low MMR Players(150-200). I want that Low MMR Players gain a good amount from High MMR Players but High MMR Players should not gain a lot and way less. 
The /mmr change variance command i dont get it tbh.. so im here again after trying out but dont find a solution
-d mmr change variance
there should be a link to a calculator in the docs
it‚Äôs not the most simple thing but you should just try setting the value to 800 or 400
well i guess in your case the opposite
try 2400
Okay thank you ill try it out
sorry i‚Äôm not following
So, i tested it. and i somehow just dont get the results i want unlucky i guess. If i have 616 MMR and my opponement 100 MMR he still losese -20.1 MMR.. its pretty unbalanced if u get what i mean?
i testet it in both directions lower value and higher value
you just have to skew it more
the calculator will tell you what to use
that will coount for players that only clicked on join queue, or for everyone in the server?
only people who have joined queue before
if you haven‚Äôt joined queue, the bot won‚Äôt even see you basically
what os the command again? /autoroles?
-d autoroles games set
set lower to 0, and upper to 1000000
Queria saber como posso colocar a leaderborad com as caracter√≠sticas dos players em um canal separado, at√© agora n√£o consegui colocar a leaderboard em canal nenhum, tentei por API no site e tentei por comandos, mas n√£o achei nenhum que desse na documenta√ß√£o
./rolerequirement add not working
In the channel u want the leadearboard do `/link` and select the queue u want to pull the stats for the leadearboard then do `/leadearboard` in the linked channel
Whats not working?
i added 4 require role to que
and still everyone can join
okay got it
bot added @everyone as require role
By default that role is added
So you need to remove it
Thank you
how do i fully remove a player from the leaderboard? he was caught cheating*
Reset its stats
Or do a banned role if u want to
`/leaderboardconfig ignoreroles add `
<@145305657237700608>  you know why this happens? works like after the 20th time lol
how can i get integers mmr ?
mmr win +20
mmr loss -15
i don't want to see 1660.0 just 1660
~~on mmr change, put static to true~~
Wait
Its just like that, the mmr
yea it always displays with 1 decimal
Hi, the leaderboard can be reset?
with the same queue name
If u wanna reset, then u need to reset the queue stats
I want to place mmr by roles
mmr by roles?
You mean give roles based on mmr?
We are using the bot to create lol games, the problem is that there are many of us with different divisions and we wanted to give people with a low division an mmr, and those in a high division another mmr, is it possible?
Hmm i dont get it at all
For example:
Silver Player: 200 mmr
Diamond player: 700 mmr
is it possible?
-d startingmmr set
i did but dont work
Need to reset player stats
./set mmr 900 frosty
resolved
im not quite sure how to ask the AI bot so ill ask here. I have a 10mans server, is there an option to allow the bot to select a random player in the queued players to host the custom lobby?
is there a way to make it so players gain a certain amnt of elo and lose a certain amnt of elo every time?
-d lobbydetails set
if you open the docs there is an example of exactly that
-d mmr change set
you can use the `static` option
so the command would be -d mmr change set static
`/mmr change set`
im using the /managestats reset mmr command but it isnt resetting the leaderboard
whats happening?
Hello, I just came across this bot recently and am trying to set it up in my server. when i use "/setup" it says "Starting Queue Setup!" but nothing happens
it says there should be an interactive set up guide but nothing seems to appear. Any help would be appareciated üôè
make sure the bot has permissions to send messages
it looks like it does have permission but still not initiating setup
the channel or category is probably denying it
it looks like it can send messages because when i use "/startqueue" it works but not "/setup"
think i got it now
i just turned on all message options (messages/threads/private threads etc..)
yea, responding to a command is different than being able to send messages
no perms required
Hello, How do I remove a role permission to enter the teams' call?
The bot is creating the call with the permission of this role to enter, I want to prevent the bot from creating the call with this permission.
You‚Äôre the greatest human being ever, thank you
You really do be helping people and they barely say thank you
Im a new gen how I fix
it will copy the permissions of the category, so you can just update the category perms
did you vote for a winner?
Ohhh
i can't see /priority role and values with /info. any chance to see my settings? i can't remember
is there any way possible i can see a previously resetted leaderboard
My server's mvp's are not counting and I have already enabled mandatory voting, what do I do?
hi there, how do i add leaderboard with wins/losses mmr etc to my neatqueue channel? thanks

How to setup this bot
Theres a basic tutorial on the channel's topic
Hey ya'll i'm having an issue of players in my server joining voice channels of matches they aren't playing in. Any idea how I can correct this? The players that have access to the queue share a common Role which is why I think they can connect to these voice channels
you should be able to update the category permissions to deny that role from joining VCs
the bot will manually add each player to their respective team VC
so /voicechannel permissions set Role: "x" Permission "connect" Value: "Deny"?
And if people disconnect from that channel and need to get back in will they need to be re added manually by a mod or can they do it on their own? <@145305657237700608>
they should be able to join on their own
ok cool
this should work, but you can probably just update the category perms directly
using the Discord UI
ok gotcha
I'm having a problem with mvp, it doesn't register.
do you know if anyone is getting the required number of votes?
Having a few issues. 

Just as the person above me stated,  I am also having issues with MVP Rewards. The individual(s) are receiving the right amount of upvotes (1) but the role is not being issued. However, if I enter the queue alone and force start, and end match and vote for myself for MVP, I receive the role. 

Secondly, I want the MMR Rate to be a straigt +10 for win, and -15 for loss, and +5 for MVP. But it is adding additional points, for example we played a game and won, and got +13.9. Some help with that would be cool. 

(Does the MVP Voting/Rewards go to the player with most votes? Or does everyone who gets voted for it receive the incentives? If so, is there a way to make it to where only the person who gets the most votes gets the rewards?)
if you want a very specific mmr change, use the static option
-d mmr change set
as for the mvp, only the player who receives the required number of votes gains the reward
Right, the required number of votes is one
But people weren‚Äôt receiving the role

-d managestats reset player
this didnt work
yea the AI lied, thats not a thing
currently there isn't any way to check
ai is lying üò¶ it would be a very cool feature tho, ty anyway
yea i have all the info tracked, just not a good way to display it atm
hi is the bot down?, no commands work & cant start a new setup even
its working
yea seems fine
it worked out after a few min, is there a way to make a specific queue Soloq only? because we just added another queue and it kinda makes people join the soloq with a party
-d partyqueue
-d partyqueue toggle
Still having issues with MVP. I set required votes to 1, and it still is not awarding the role or additional MMR.
could you give me an example game number + your server ID?
Game #8 

1218928069084057600
looks like the required votes is set to 5?
hmm no i see its set to 1
seems to work for me, did you change the required votes after the match started?
I kept running the command to set it to one after each game because I realized it still wasn‚Äôt rewarding anything. We will be playing again here shortly, so I will let you know if it‚Äôs working or not
Looking for some help with this.

<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> how to set a role, which can use admin commands
also is there a command through which a role can only score the games, but not use any other admin command
<@145305657237700608> hi if i wanna make it so the winners gain 30 mmr and losers lose 20 whats the command
-d staffrole add
Not really
-d mmr change set
okk ty
is the premium
a one time purchase
or is it a subscription
so if i buy 5 credits and buy the 5 credit plan is that for life? or is that 5 credits every month
Its a subscription
so 5 credits everymonth
<@648635725964902411> i want to add a staff role, but dont want to allow them to use end queue command
It resets the whole queue setup
Also what does clear queue command does? 
The staffs unknowingly use it, instead of /outcome cancel cmd 
and after /clear queue cmd doesn't cancels their game, they use end queue and other cmds and mess it all
is there a way to where, once you hit a certain mmr, you automatically move up in to a higher rank and another queue
is there also a way to make it so only a certain role is in a certain leaderboard... eg

bronze leaderboard only consists of players with the bronze role

silvee leaderboard only consits of players with the silver role
-d staffrole command allow
-d autoroles
-d rolerequirement
do you mind checking your dms
curretnyl when a queue pops in my server, its like "queue number 1599" is there a way to make that 0
and is it possible to have that across differnent queues aswell
is there anyway to remove the cooldown for checking stats
no, its unique per server
also no
i start a queue and it only says queue started but no option to join

Btw it worked yeterday
make sure the bot has perms to send messages
ok thanks ill try
tysm it works
It‚Äôs doing the two queues in the same channel thing again üòë
can u give me a match number to check
<@145305657237700608> when i use the neat q command for mmr change and use static, im still only getting the average per win, how do i make it so its a flat 30 per win and 20 perl oss
-d mmr change set
enable static
then i have to put an amount and a loser amount right?
Next time it happens I will, I‚Äôve just closed them all out that just occurred
its fine if its closed if you have the match number still
no, the loser_mmr is optional
but if you want, sure
yah so if i want to gain 30 and lose 20 per match is that right
alright tysm
57729 and 57738
this is  along shot but is there a way to have somoene play x amount of games and depending on how many they win they get placed into a different rank?
so like if i wanted soeone to play 3 placement matches and like, if u win 1/3 ur bronze , 2/3 silver , 3/3 gold, after the three games theres no way to automatically move them right?\
like those games were sharing the channel?
i think i found the issue
It‚Äôs happening a lot but I‚Äôm at dinner
sorry :/
It‚Äôs all good man
What do you think it is?
not confident but there seems to be times where the channel is not being marked as used, so a new match comes and grabs it
think i see why but not 100%
is the bot down?
Looks like Node 2 is [offline](https://www.neatqueue.com/status).
is there a way to make everyones MMR 0
instead of 1000
like when i reset mmr for everyone it resets it back to 1000, how do i make it reset to 0 mmr
-d starting mmr
and node 2 died again...
oh...
is that for everyone, or a specific role
-d starting mmr set
it still says 1000 üòî
you have to reset mmr again
does it have to be in that paticlar queue
because im worried itll overide the mmr set for the role, like if i want everyone to start on zero for open queue, but i want players who are like silver to be able to play with players of their own mmr, so if i make starting mmr 0 in the bronze queue catergory is it gonna mess with the pre set mmr restrictions?
these are per-queue settings
unless you have stats shared between multiple queues
i believe i disbaled stat share between queues
did it again i set starting mmr as 0 and it still shows 1000
How do I update a config save? I only see an option to save a new one (i.e., save vs. save as).
check your /info to verify the starting MMR looks fine
you can't update, think of each config as a "snapshot"
although maybe you should be able to overwrite configs from your own server
I see. So, when starting/restarting the queue does it then load the most recent "snapshot?"
if you use the most recent config code, yes
each config code can only be used once
Hmmm...not following. I am trying to avoid a lengthy config process every time the queue is started.
you shouldn't be ending the queue once you make it
so this is my bronze catergory, i want everyone to be starting 0 but why is the @everyone role at 1k how i delete that
set up your queue and leave it there forever
-d startingmmr remove
thats the default
I stopped it because I could not figure out how to get it out of test mode. When I restarted, I lost all of the work I had done.
when you stopped the queue it should have given you a code to reload it
you can exit test mode via /test
Is it recommended then to do saves/snapshots along the way while I am still configuring?
if you don't wanna mess anything up that might help
Side note: what you have created is remarkable. So impressed.
thanks!
If it had a GUI, I would buy you a new car. üôÇ
That reads like I followed a compliment by an insult...not at all what I meant/intended.
is the bot down again
if for example i do role reuirement and add a silver role, and i do another role requirement and add a gold role, do players need to have BOTH roles to be able to join the queue? or just one
Server is down
any update on fix eta?
<#919709100114346076> will be up in a sec
What's the use-case(s) for linking a channel to another channel's queue?
Displaying leadearboard in that channel
yes since you can have many different queues in a server, you can link to specific queues
I wanted to host an event, first one to play 50 games from now onwards will get xx amount of prize. 

a) Is it possible to reset everyone "games played" but not their other stats? 

b) Is it possible to count their games played from the time of that announcement without messing with their old games played and also not messing with their old stats.
<@145305657237700608>
`1)` You can set the games played to 0 for everyone. `2)` No, you will need to track them on a new different queue so they dont merge `3)` You dont need to ping neatz
1) what's the command for that? 
2) can we switch back to old queue, if we create a new queue  to track? If yes what's the cmd
-d set games
the other option would be to swap to a new stats system temporarily and then swap back after the tournament
yeah what's the cmd pls tell
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
either change the queue name (option 3), or use /leaderboardconfig sharedstats set (option 2)
Is it possible to disable `/cancel` prior to the voting screen appearing? What's happened a few times is players have cancelled prior to everyone joining the VC, but because the match didnt start, there is no log of the match in our mod logs. Occasionally, they are unable to requeue and given the error that they still have to vote for the previous match
latest example was 57986
ss of when the match was cancelled^
no theres no way to do that
also, the issue of needing to vote for the match is still happening?
you mean the one from earlier right
like last week
hasnt happened so far
we are talking abt the same thing right, using the same channel for 2 matches?
^ here you said the match is cancelled but it tells them they need to vote for a winner before queuing
different thing i thought
my brain is mush rn
direct quote from the player "its saying i cant join queue while in match setup but the match i was in got canceled?"
so my mistake, match setup not voting for winner

<@145305657237700608> is it possible to update an existed config and keep the same name ?
what are you stuck on
Just not understanding what commands i need to set it up fairly new to adding bots and make a discord sorry
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
<@648635725964902411> thank youuuuuu!!!!
If I have my teamsize set to 4 and teams set to 2, why would my queue be showing 0/16? Which setting do I have wrong?
What I have:
Three separate queues, one for 6mans (3v3), 4mans (2v2), and 2mans (1v1). All of them have their own channels for players to start the queue, and participate in games. Using the /leaderboard command in each channel, will show the leaderboard for that specific queue.
-----
What I want:
One channel, named "leaderboards" which shows all three queue leaderboards at the same time. (Three seperate messages for the three separate queues) The channel will be an only view channel, with no one being able to message, so the neatqueue bot messages will stay there as the only three messages.
-----
The issue:
I have managed to show all three leaderboards in a row using the command /leaderboard queue_name: . However, the title of all leaderboards show the same title, which is "2mans mmr leaderboard". As well as when the leaderboards are refreshed, they all revert back to the 2mans leaderboard.
-----
Example:
Me: /leaderboard queue_name:6mans
Neatqueue: Shows 6mans leaderboard, but says "2mans mmr leaderboard"
Me: /leaderboard queue_name:4mans
Neatqueue: Shows 4mans leaderboard, but says "2mans mmr leaderboard"
Me: /leaderboard queue_name:2mans
Neatqueue: Shows 2mans leaderboard, and says "2mans mmr leaderboard"
-----
Solution?
Is there a command so the bot automatically renews leaderboard at a certain time, 
For eg bot deletes it's old lb msg and sends new lb at 12 am daily. 
Or edits the msg
you might have set the number of lobbies to 2
-d numberoflobbies
no but the bot will auto update the leaderboard when stats change
What I have:
You are correct. I assumed that needed to match the number of teams. Two teams, one lobby each. Is that not correct?
no you want 1 lobby for the entire match
"lobby" meaning the grouping of players
in a 5v5, its a single lobby
Ahhhhh! That description is more helpful. So, is there a separate setting for putting each team into their own VC for the match?
yes but thats by default
-d voicechannels teamchannels
Brilliant!
When I join <#915810764277817354> enough times to trigger a match, it quickly bans me before I can do anything. I ran into this on my own server when in test mode so I came here to see if it did the same.
Its on test mode
It reduces the timers
They are pretty short in test mode
How do I get in the BO6 8s discord?
Like set up a queue for bo6?
is there a way to give a role automatically if they reach a certain MMR or anything?
if so could someone show or tell me how
peep the autoroles section https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/
"Ranks/Automatically Assign Discord Roles"
Could this be possible?
is there a coinflip command? because i have a server with a big mix of na and eu and rather not go for another bot if this bot has this function but cant seem to find it
Well, the bot by default has the `requiredvotes` to majority, so after someone votes, it for sure has a background timer to see if there are enough votes, altough i dont know if this timer can be changed, and i think the majority of votes are based on the teamsize
No theres not
not directly but you can get random details in your lobby details
-d lobbydetails set
check the docs for an example
Leaderboard isn't loading, glitched
currently using  text type
Please fix asap
It can get bug sometimes
If u wanna see the lb, click the name, it will take u to a website leaderboard
When the bot creates the team call, it creates it with the channel category position and this ends up making it so that whoever has the category position can enter. Would it be possible to change this and let the bot set the call position only for the players in the queue?
it will take the channel category perms
you could play with
-d voicechannel permission
how do i unban someone from the neatqueue so they can queue up?

<@145305657237700608> i have 2 reshuffles enabled in my queue and when i reshuffle the map i get the same reshuffled map again how can i fix that?
I am trying to have two queues in one channel based on an mmr system. So low mmr can only join a specific queue etc etc. However, it seems that players can only join the queue that was last posted. So If i have a low Q then add a Mid Q the people who are mid range mmr can join the mid Q but the lower mmr players cannot join the LOW Q above it for its saying they are too high of an mmr when they arnt
So Do I have to have the Queues in separate text channels in order for this to work and have multiple queues?
You cant have two queues in one channel

Hello, with what command do I remove the title of a queue **TEST MODE**. The `/testmode disable` command does not work for me.
That doesnt exist
Just run `/test` again
xDD!
hey How do u have the queue bot tell u which team is host
or what person will be host
and how do u have it show everyone Points when the captains pick
Theres no host
You could make a votingmenu random that chooses a "host" either team 1 or team 2
`/votingmenu add title:Host options:Team1,Team2 key:Team hosting force_random:True`
This will show before the voting message appears
ok let me try this then i have just a couple more questions if u dont mind
or with
-d lobbydetails set
the docs has an example
yea i read trough the doc .. and i somewhat tried the lobby set already // i did /lobbydetail set  HOST
so that picks a random host every time right ?
i keep forgetting that feature lolz

if you need to clear out some channels that should be fine, hopefully within the next 24hours we can tell if its better
itll take some time for everything to clean itself up
I believe I figured it out. I still needed to run the `/teamselection set` command and *only* select Balanced. Do I have that right now?

Why would one of my `/serverstats channelnames inqueue` instances be showing the queue count for a different queue? The #scrim-queue is updating the #8s: Lobby channel name. I have removed the `/serverstats channelnames inqueue` from both queues to ensure neither was updating. I then ran the command on *only* the 8s channel to update the 8s VC. However, the 8s VC continues to display the queue count of the Scrim queue. I am at a loss.
Okay, it's even more odd. It isn't just showing the count of another queue. It shows the total count of two separate queues. Why would it do that?
It is summing the 8s-queue *and* the scrim-queue.
it‚Äôs a server wide stat, not per queue

Hi Neatz,

We are encountering problems with people not being able to see the queue.

We tried solving it by having one person leave, which allows others to see the queue afterward.

What do you think would be the best fix for this?
check the Message History permission
-d channel name
you probably have some channel name overrides
What does that mean ? And what should i do about it?

how to show leaderboard with a button
Hi, i wanted to ask if is possible to put the autoban for x players that vote wrong team (and put the time that is banned too) and if is possible to put cooldown (for example my game is 10 min and i wanted to put cooldown until the 3rd minute that people cant do prevote) <@145305657237700608>
i asked on the ai and he cant solve me my question
you can just use `/leaderboard` and it will have controls
With stats
Like this
just do `/stats`
I hope you don't mind me getting your attention this way I didn't want to ping you directly I wasn't sure what the rules are in the server 
as far as pinging staff goes I have a couple questions I'm interested in using the bot thank you
The ia did not understand my message

The bot removes MMR if someone does not join the vc in time, how do I remove this? I want mmr values to stay the same
Do you have /dodge mmrpenalty?
Set it to 0
Is it possible to connect 2 different queues to the same leaderboard?
Yes but they will share stats
So the queues will have the same stats
<@648635725964902411> can you answer that? thanks
First one, not possible
Closest thing is
-d anticheat flag incorrectvoting
Second one is /timer winnervotemessage
i tried these 2 but they failed, i will try that one now, thanks!
players are still losing MMR even with the penalty set to 0
this is about players who fail to join the voice chat within the allotted time
So i tried making a new queue to kinda combine it w a current existing one but it seems that the leaderboard crashes everytime and it seems to not want to combine it ( tried using /leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide and /link )
Then disable autoban cuz that should fix it
any possible solutions?
would that open up the option for people who want to troll to join the queue?
I figure without the autoban, people will join, then dodge vc then rejoin right away
and when theres no admin/mods to timeout them, they would hold the queue hostage
are those 3 the only commands related to the join penalty?
i mean that should be it, because by default theres no penalty
so idk why your command of mmr penalty doesnt work
yep i just tested, enabled mmr penalty, it deducted my mmr, then i disabled it, now it doesnt deduct
could it be possible the command has to be ran on all different queues/channels?
instead of being guild-wide, if I have multiple channels for different gamemodes, then each one would need it?
yes, most configs are per queue

Hey! Is there a way to unlock the temporary voice channels the bots make so other people can join in?

Hi I would like help with Captains Drafttype when I asked AI support "Can you make me a custom type draft with the double pick at the end for the second captain" he gave me the command
/votingmenu the problem being that I can't figure out how to use it could you help me to be able to create a new captains drafttype where the 2nd captain has the double pick at the end before the last pick for 5v5s
why dont you run snake?
do the channels auto delete
after a match
when
it should ask if you want to reshuffle maps when picked randomly
when the winner is picked
mine didnt for some reason
there‚Äôs no way to get a custom draft type
so it won't work if set on least frequent?
Stuck getting the message: You must vote for Queue#15 to enter a new queue!

the leaderboard command, when i want to choose what queue to display, does the queue have to had some games active?

-d lobbychannel pullall

do you have a screenshot?
queue 213 jreplay had 1104mmr next queue he lost 25mmr but ended up with 975mmr
Did someone change the MMR manually?
The matches show correct MMR changes
I went through the logs and didn't see any changes
how did jreplay went from 1104 to 998mmr
check your /logs ? Also did any previous match have the outcome modified?
how i can chagne queue voice channel name ?
Good evening, I am using the command I am using the command /autoroles leaderboardposition set [role] [stat] [lower_value] (upper_value) to create roles based on the MMR, which command do I use to create the role that the command argument asks me for?
nothing on logs, I think some other staff messed up... I will just return their points manually
I need an answer as soon as possible
The role its just a discord role
I have another question, I use the argument:

/autoroles leaderboardposition set role:@Silver I (S1) stat:MMR lower_value:1 upper_value:199(To assign the lowest rank which in this case would be silver 2).

The question is that using the same argument but now with the role Silver 2(Rank 200-399MMR), this role is not assigned to the user who has that amount of MMR and the previous role is not eliminated(Silver 1). The same with the higher ranks
it‚Äôs not talking about 0-199 MMR, it‚Äôs position on the leaderboard
so ranks 0 to 199
So how do I declare them to use the MMR/Points? I'm sorry if I'm annoying, I've been using Discord bots for a short time.
-d autoroles mmr
Thanks a lot
idk 90% of how this bot works i just cancel matches for chandler, am i able to manually change their teams?
There I did as you told me and it should work correctly, is it not necessary to reset the MMR/Points of the players to prevent bugs? Since the amount of ranks is about 18 ranks.
Can anyone help me set up a premium for more than 3 queues?
how can i let 2 teams vote on maps

what do you mean exactly?
-d map voting
disable `per_team`
make sure you use `/bestof`, seems like you added a custom voting menu but the bot doesn't interpret that as the best of config
Nothing, I solved it. Sorry

How do I remove a game queue I put in the wrong channel ?
Hi i have one question and one bug i guess.

The question: What command is to change the time that you can stay in the queue before to be kicked in the queue for inactivity? Is because people that are in the queue says me that they are more that 10 min (that i put with a command) and it seems a bug, is if is possible to change it

The bug: Sometimes when the captains are afk the bot put the most mmr player in his team. The thing is that they have 30 seconds, but the bot has a delay and it put the player after other 30 seconds, idk if is a bug or is to purpose or i can change that paramether with a command.
<@145305657237700608> bug queue does not appear
you dont have a queue in that channel
-d endqueue
-d timer afk
as for the second issue, ill check it out, sounds like a bug
no, i dont have the queue but i had a queue since a lot of time and it was ended for no reason
my lobby has a lot of activity so sounds a bug too
but nvm i create another queue and the stats are back so nvm
ok is because we are waiting for the captain picks and is a waste of time the delay
Thank you
yea that sounds annoying
can you share your config?
`/config save`
<@145305657237700608> hi how can i increase this timer
-d lobby timer
i did that but in 5 seconds just cancel the match
you are in test mode so it has a very short timer
to test
aaaa
thanks
i have another one right now, because due to create another queue, the config wont save it

Hello ladies and gentlemen, does anyone know if there is a way to make a voting menu appear to select weapon bans after a map is selected?

I've created one using
`/votingmenu add key:Weapon banned options:AK47, AK74M, AK12, M16, G3, M24, MK14, VSS, KRISS, GLOCK, COLT eligible_voters:All show_numbers:True number_of_votes:1 allow_random:True title:Weapon Ban team_voting:All Teams repeat:0`

But I can't seem to make it show up after map selection is done
oh... set the repeat to 1
thats the default, ill add a constraint to ensure its >= 1

tried looking through AI and user guide online, can't find a solution to my queue vc not working. the queue fills up to 3 of 4 and when the fourth person joins, it does not register it. so it stays at 3/4 when the vc for queueing is at 4/4
why is the bot removing roles and adding roles?

depends on your `/map selection`, but you can set it to be "Least Frequent"
Is this for joining queue when you join VC?

I had some trouble with Ties in the Tournament queue (matches doenst report to challonge),  Is ths a known bug or is there any configuation to fix this?
im not sure tournaments can handle ties
for a bracket
Challonge/Swiss can. I will try to do it in challonge and then cancel the game ends in a draw.
Thanks! Awesome bot and tournament is a great freature
ah gotcha, i didn‚Äôt think about for swiss
ok, i‚Äôll have to revisit that idea, unfortunately i‚Äôm away this week so can‚Äôt update it soon

Hello I just want to know can I do drafts of 8 teams 88 players in total each team will have 11 players and 8 captains will pick their players
I tried to test it out and it says that
What server?
88 player is quite a few, captain selection probably won‚Äôt work
I cant shuffle seeds for a tournamanent bracket, it always start in the order of joining (first joining player at table 1, second at table 2 and so on). Team selection modes is set to Random.
With the shuffle comands (captain reshuffle and matchstart shuffleonstart) nothing changed. 
In challonge I also cant shuffle seeds between command tournament start and tournament startmatches. Is there any workaround?
Always get the same bracket in joining order for Round 1 (I even try it without test mode and real accounts).
i would expect the seeds to based on MMR
that shuffle command doesn‚Äôt work for tournaments but that‚Äôs a good idea
hm, understand. so a workaround could be to give the players a random MMR increase right before starting the tournament. I'll try this out, but not what I'm looking for in my case.
One question, will the parinings for round 2+ came from Challonge and the MMR isnt used?
yea, everything after the initial seeding is handled by challonge
Doesnt work, I change  the base MMR for 2 of 6 players and it ends gain in seeding order.
other workaround, I clear the queue and add the players in a random order manually, "just expected 32+ players" üòî
hmm interesting, it should be based on mmr
is your tournament queue stats the same as your normal queue?
also, can‚Äôt you change the seeding on challonge?
nope, other queue/stats. all players are mmr 1000 here
nope, the seeding option in challonge doesnt work without participations, but as soon I "start the tournament" and send the player names to challonge the bracket is genererated directly and challonge doenst give the option to random seed anymore
ah gotcha
thanks for your support of course
probably would be smart to update it so the players are instantly added to the bracket
instead of waiting until it starts
but that‚Äôs for me to do
if you could changet this, it  would be awesome. not sure how it than work when participations leave the queue later before starting
hi all!

can someone please tell  me how to set up this bot so that there is a queue in a specific channel and players can join and when queue is full make a channel just for that queue with the captains and stuff but as soon as that channel is created another queue to be made
you can make a
-d spectatorrole add
yes it must be your own challonge account and you must be staff in the discord
that sounds like the default behavior, use /setup
When using /api/outcome/tie
it only asks about my match number and not my server so when trying to execute the post i get "detail": "Could not fetch server"
hey! we are creating a new server and want to assign MMR/roles with the bot to balance the games from the beginning, is that possible ? andif so, with which commands?

Hello, I am following up on my question regarding find out who initiates a /cancel user command for neatque. I have looked through the logs a few times and im not seeing any indication of who entered the command. Could you please clarify what I should be looking for? Here is an example of a cancelled que using /cancel.
People in queue keep losing their spot when a game ends and people queue up past 8 players
Can we fix that? or is that on yalls end?
check /logs, not the audit logs
it shouldn‚Äôt be removing people from queue if they are already in there
is it?
Ahh, I see. Thank you very much
It is yes
When we get 9 it seems to not register at least one person on the bench
and skips over them
and puts in the 9th
How can I set the maximum number of players allowed in a queue? Meaning if I want to set the max to 8 players in a queue a 9th will not be able to join until the current queue launches

is there a way to change the points gain/loss when reaching a specific amount of mmr, for example upon reaching the points between 300-500 you gain 20+ and 500+ points you get 15+? or vice versa if lower than 300 points, you earn +30 per game?

No and no

I‚Äôm not sure if this was mentioned already or not but is there anyway to fix this?

Whenever someone with priority joins, it moves the other person with priority who was queued up before, to the middle of the line instead of reorganizing them to 1st and 2nd in line.

For reference, we have multiple levels of priority. Sant! has highest priority, and Juanpa has next to highest, in regards to those queued up.
I have this message : You must vote for Queue#3 to enter a new queue !
but i'm not on the Queue
are you sure about their priorities? It should definitely insert based on the value
And i have 0 other queue
How to unlock the situation?
The photo is of the priorities I've made.

Everyone from Juanpa to Silva was moved behind Sebasabramo when Sant! entered. So it somehow moved 5 people to the back of the line, not just 1.
If you have the perms, you can use `/outcome cancel match_number:` or something like that to end the queue. You should be able to see the match number wherever results are posted
It‚Äôs good Thx
does the queue still look like that? Or do you have a match number i can check against?
I tested something else real quick. It apparently doesn't matter which role is joined.

Alisha should be first in line, unless I join. If I join, they should be second. Regardless of which role I joined up as, they were moved to the middle of the pack, along with the 6 people immediately after them before I joined.

I don't have a match number for it, since it's just the lobby waiting for 22 people. But I just saved a config for it, if that helps.
Might be an issue with role queue and displaying, let me see
deployed a change, can you check again?
Looks like that fixed it! Thanks!

Is there a way to add a delay between when the teams are created and people are moved to the team VCs versus it being instant?
how do we make everyone elo start at 0 and not 1000
/ starting mmr for everyone
How can you turn on/off the setting to DM a player to check if they are still active in the queue?
is is possible if we can rotate the maps selection, so it doesn't randomize and repeat maps?
-d map selection
pick "Least Frequent"
wouldn't itt repeat the least freq maps then?
once a map is picked its not the least frequent anymore
no but i mean, till now whatever maps have been chosen
their frequencies weren't recorded?
I put /startingmmr 0 @xrole, and some players got 1k mmr
is that normal?
Now i have reseted all mmr but it didnt change the roles of players neither changed the rating in the nickname
I tried refreshing but still nothing, i have to do it manually
check your /info
I can only link 1 queue to 1 channel?
How to refresh nicknames to display the correct mmr?
<@145305657237700608>
they should have been
if i recall
a channel can only link to 1 queue
should do it automatically when their MMR changes
Its not doing it unless someone joins the queue, new players have to join queue to get their ratinginname and role
Im not using /register
<@145305657237700608> your the goat
Because roblox has an bot (bloxlink) wich automatically connects their roblox account, so decided not to use /register
is there any way to automatically updated their nicknames with the mmr?
right when joining the server
use map add, to add maps
no there are no map pools
just 1 big pool of maps
Hello, 
Your bot seems very generous in terms of functions, a player asked me to see if we can use it 

My use case is : I own servers on which I run gameservers and I can develop the tooling I need (command line, rest api, ...), I have players that wants to do ladders 1vs1, and I want that the players use the bot to setup a match, and make the bot configure (gamemode, map, password, ...) and start the gameserver 

Could you please give me the big lines on how I can do that?
the bot has webhooks for match events and a full API to execute any command
so you can listen for matches starting, set up a server, resolve the winner automatically,
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
ok, that way
thanks !
Hey, for some reason the mmr leaderboard for this queue does not want to show but it will show the leaderboard for all the other stats like games played etc, I can not immediately find a solution unless I am overlooking something?
Can be discord bug
Try deleting and re spawning it
Hi <@145305657237700608> could you improve this? (tournament need to shuffle seats before first pairing). 
I run some smaller tournaments in the meantime and work around with adding all participants manually to the queue after shuffle them (in excel sheets), but it is uncomfortable work and for bigger events no way.
Is there an way to automaticly refresh nicknames according to mmr
I dont think thats an feature
It automatically does
In my server it doesnt, idk why
Hes supposed to have 0 on his nickname
I think it only refreshes once hes on the queue
<@145305657237700608>
bot off? <@145305657237700608>
don‚Äôt think so
It doesn't let us register or anything.
I didn't say anything
how to Change the max number of players allowed in a queue?
-d teamsize
If I have 4 queues can i link all of the stats to a single channel if they all have different MMRS?
or does there have to be individual stat channels for each queue?
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
What exactly does this /mmr decay command do, I don't quite understand.
Like, imagine u get to 2k mmr, and u dont play for a month, u can set it to decay if the player doesnt play for 1 month and the mmr will start lowering to an certain value u chose
How do I remove the MMR in the nickname for all users? I already used the "/ratinginname" command and disabled it, but people still appear with the MMR in their nickname.
I think u have to do it manually, or they just join the queue and it does automaticly
it should remove the nicknames when you disable the command if the bot has permissions
Is there a way to remove people from the leaderboard who haven't played a match or queued in a while?
how to reset leaderboard instantly
You can reset their stats
Or do a banned role for the leadearboard
-d manage stats reset
how do i change max players in a role?
Why doesn't it give MMR to the MVP player? You already use the command `/mvp reward amount: 25`
-d roles
you can specify the same role multiple types
is anyone getting the required votes?
What I did is enable the option to vote for the MVP player, then the option to vote first for the MVP player before voting for the winning team, when you vote for the MVP player and the winning team, the winning team gives everyone 100 MMR as well as the MVP player who should get 125 MMR.

How to  remove balanced captain random unfair from team selection
-d teamselecti9n
Hello! I'm trying to get the bot setup for 1v1s and 4 player free for all for a card game, but I'm not sure how to get a lot of the extra stuff to not pop up that's not needed for card games or 1v1s. I.E when 2 peopel join the 1v1 queue it's asking them for a team captain and all of that stuff, then it puts them into their own seperate calls, but they need to be in the same call to play the card game and talk to each other. 

I have the bot working and the queue works for the right amount of players, I just need it to stop:

- Asking all of the extra questions like team captains and pick your teammates

- creating 2 seperate voice channels for the "teams"
-d teamselection set
-d voicechannels teamchannels
those should be what you need
thank you
<@145305657237700608> how can i change that i want set map selection to there and i want write to maps
map selection happens after teams are picked
if you add maps via
-d map add
so i dont need that how can i remove this?
sorry last question, how do I make it so there isn't MMR changes? I set it to pug/normal but there's still MMR changes
-d mmr change
-d mmr change set
And do 0
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Bruh i tried an tournament and it had an ton of errors, i dont trust tournaments feature now, i improvised but i got sad i had so many people, atleast the brackets feature worked
what errors?
"Tournament participants can no longer be added
Name has already been taken"

Then it wouldnt let me start it
and then when i was changing up the name of the queue it deleted all players, so i improvised without the queue
And if u want the configs for it, it was saved as JNQVN, i ended the queue
-d readyup
-d readyup mode
<@145305657237700608> there is an error with the api I think
for example, the endpoint /matches
im getting the player ids in number format
and the id its incorrect

      [
        {
          "name": "iClown",
          "id": 256112978020007940,

      ],
```
and my discord id its 256112978020007938
is rounding the numbers
are you using js/ts by chance
this response its from the API Swagger UI
hmm that‚Äôs probably the same issue
javascript can‚Äôt handle numbers that large
the api should retreive it as string
or Bigint
need to use a json parsing library like lossless-json
it is a big int, but javascript json parsing doesn‚Äôt handle big ints
usually i return as a string but not in this case it seems
so ive to try this?
for now at least, i‚Äôm traveling for the holidays so can‚Äôt make any changes
no problem
using lossless-json worked
thank u

Is there any way I can have the leaderboard be a leaderboard of parties and not by individual players?
Damn
How am I able to create a stats channel where it shows the players ranking after the games?
Thats just the leaderboard

Hey, I created a que but made some mistakes in numbers, so then i deleted a message sent by the bot. Now when i try to make another one it says the que is already running and i have no clue how to close previous one

alright, thanks

To give a role 100% of mmr multiplier how do I add it to the value? in /mmr multipliers set
`/mmr multipliers` `role` `2.0`
Is this command correct?
I made the roles for the player when they go into the queue, and I created a voice channel for it to show how many players are in the queue, how long does it take for it to show? Is their a delay on the number display?
channel names are limited to 2 updates per 10 minutes so it‚Äôs not great
discord limitation
Gotcha, I'm about the 12 minute market and it shows 0 but I have two players in the queue, i'm waiting to see when it will change
<@145305657237700608> how to create an queue like this
use /queuetype Select Team On Join
and /roles
Thanks!
If i were to remove the roles from the queue how would i do it?
like tank,DPS and support option
U need to retype the roles, but skipping the ones that you are gonna delete
No queue found!
If you want a queue in this channel, run `/startqueue` or `/setup`!
If you want to control a specific queue from this channel, use `/link`!
Can u give me an example of skipping
Just dont type the role that u want to remove
Hi, can you please help me set up my queues so that people can only join the next queue after the previous one was already voted upon?
and how could I make it so majority of players need to vote before it closes (7 out of 12)

my players have been re-queueing as soon as a match starts, and sometimes the queue fills up for a 2nd game while the 1st game is still in progress, so these players end up abandoning the 1st game half-way to join the 2nd game VC
-d requeue condition
-d requiredvotes winner
is possible to debug the queue when i have 1 queue with 3 party teams with 2 players that i have 8 slots?
i show you a example
`/teamsize size: ` might work?
** **
** **
Is the bot down?

Edit: it started working again
For some reason sometimes they give MMR to the MVP and sometimes they don't? Does anyone know why?
the problem is that i allow parties with 2 players maximum. The thing of that is when the captains are one, it must be forced to pick party teams unless it will bug as you see in the screenshot <@415301114817413133>
the thing is that if is possible in that case to do priority to parties to pick so, we can avoid this kind of problems
the queue is from 4v4 matches, idk if dev can give me a solution about that
Oh, so this isn't a draft, but joining as a team?
is a regular queue
that join 8 players and the captain mode
So I think I may have missed something... 8 players join. How many teams do you want, and how many per team?
2 teams
is 4v4 match
the problem is the party teams that join because as you can see in the screenshot it happen may be 5v3
Maybe try:
`/partyqueue preventoverfill toggle:Enabled`

Idk for sure, as I don't allow parties to join in mine
do predictions not work currently. The leaderboard of points doesnt match people's actual points at all?
hello, and thanks! 
I ended up setting up these 2 but players are not getting any kind of prompt to vote
they are not being asked to vote on DMs either
Did u disable something?
i only did the 2 you suggested this morning
config is currently saved under name "XGBIP" if you could please take a look we would really appreciate it
Do `/logs` and look if theres any `/message winnermessage results` command used, looks like u set it to staff or disabled it
Just run `/message winnermessage results value:Default` and it goes back to normal
awesome, thanks! we will see if it works with that

sorry i dont understand... it always requires me to type something and it doesnt actually remove from choosing an role from a queue

what are you trying to do?
To remove the requirement of pressing a role before entering the queue
Can i make it so Captain role can sub an player from their team if needed?
use /roles but don‚Äôt specify any
Hi! Ive been using neatqueue for a while without any problems but just a while ago it started making these kind of channels, and i cant seem to figure out why its doing it
there is a limit to the number of channels the bot can create per day, so it reuses them
just means your server is getting active
Hi, on my server I made it so that from a certain MMR I give an automatic role but can I do it so that when a player passes a certain MMR and therefore changes role he can keep the old roles in addition? Thanks in advance
you could make the thresholds overlap ?
like 0-5000 MMR, 500-5000 MMR, etc
Thank you very much for your help, very good idea, keep up the good worküëç
Hi there, is there any way to randomize maps / modes for blackops6? So everytime we select a BO3 or BO5 is will give us maps and their modes at random? Thanks!!
-d map selection
-d gamemode selection
Thank you so much! - will it now just ramdomly pick the correct maps / modes or do I need to enter those as well somewher?
you will need to add the maps as well
-d map add
Thanks Neatz! So is it best Practice to do Each Map and Mode separately, or could you do "Vault (Hardpoint), (Control), (Search & Destroy)" as an example?
doesn‚Äôt really matter, but adding each map once is just easier
Sorry Neatz - 1 more now, it's working really well. Just the Map ban per team isn't working. But I do have Test mode enabled?
test mode shouldn‚Äôt matter
-d map bans
Thanks - now during test mode I have messed up my MMR üòÖ what's the best way to reset my own MMR Back to what it was?
-d set mmr
Thanks that's helpful, still cannot get the map bans working in test mode for some reason, is it because I've set the voting to Captains only?
are map bans showing at all?
did you enable it?
hmmm yes i believe so
map bans are not coming up in the test
can you cancel a previous queue?
without voting?
Hello, i set it up that it auto chooses random option, is there a way to remove the "Are the teams valid?" option?
./outcome cancel
Unable to access stats/leaderboards, even though voting has been done on top.gg. Is there a time restraint between voting, and the leaderboards being accessible, or should it be working automatically as soon as I vote?
type it in your server
Fixed, thank you!

Did you ever get a chance to look into the possibility of having three separate leaderboards being able to be displayed in the same channel?
Is there a way to remove Oct2024-Dec 2024? Because stats were never recorded for those seasons
if I send you the leaderboard link can you remove the 2024 months? <@145305657237700608>
i should probably update it to hide months without stats
When using /stats with the all_time parameter it does not show the all time MMR and graph but the monthly one instead. all other stats show up fine

Do we have an tutorial on how tournaments work
with challonge and stuff
i havent figured it out
Do i have to add players to challonge or the bot does it for me?
everything happens in discord but you can view/track/edit the bracket on challonge
Could it be that the bot has some issues rn?
what server?
What would you need ? Config or just Server URL?
just the name
SF2 Competitive
run /clearqueue
somehow you have a player without MMR and its breaking the matchmaker it seems
yea `ManiaCKoR`, not sure how thats possible they got into queue without MMR
Tried today the /managestats reset mmr command cause wanted that the stats are still there after every season reset could be that the issue?
probably related, yea
Hm meh ok. Is there any other way to keep the stats in the leaderboard? Would like that players can still see there wins, losses etc.
Would be great to see dez 2024 with the stats etc as well but you told me some time ago that this isnt possible.
At least without coding it on my own.
if you change the queue name you can just look at old leaderboards
-d leaderboard
the "queue_name" lets you look at old ones
Hm okay yeah but my queue is just named "versus" and dont change that normally. The /managestats reset mmr command deleted the dez 2024 month but the stats like win / losses stayed thats why wanted to try it. But when it breaks it need to use the command for everything to get reset
What is fine also. Just wanted to give my players something they could "match" each other if you know what i mean.
But thank you NeatZ üòÅ
how can i remove one given player mmr ? i cant find command for it. does it exist ?

How do i allow an party of 6 players join an 5v5 tournament?
"/partyqueue maxsize"

But if i type that command does the  teams from the queue get kicked?
if it‚Äôs a 5v5 then you can‚Äôt have a 6 person party join
since the teams are just parties i would just make the team size larger
it won‚Äôt reset the queue or kick anyone
but /teamsize does kick the people inside the queue
Can u sub in players even if your the captain and on a party, for the tournament?
Another question Challonge says, if 2 players or more are registered it will start showing the brackets, but on the queue there are 4 teams already. 


I had tested before and only /tournament start it starts showing the brackets, and /tournament refresh doesnt show too
yea the bot only registers teams on challonge when it‚Äôs started
you can still sub, it will just remove you from the match

Hello support may I ask if theres any way to show the player that got voted for mvp? by displaying its name or soemthing?
Should be seen in the match results i think
''To create a condition where two specific players or roles never join the same team, you can utilize the role restrictions feature of the bot. By assigning each player or role a specific role, you can then set up the queue to restrict players with the same role from being on the same team. This can help ensure that the two specific players or roles do not end up on the same team during the queue process. If you need further assistance with setting up these role restrictions, feel free to ask in the ‚Å†‚îÇsupport channel for more detailed guidance.''

Are you talking about discord roles, or in game roles
I enabled the option to vote for the best player (MVP), also I enabled the options to vote for the player (MVP) first and to give him +50 MMR. When a game ends, players are forced to vote for the player (MVP) but it does not give the +50 MMR, what did I do wrong or where can I see if I did well. Thanks.
probably nobody got enough votes to be marked the MVP
ohhhh ok!
hey a question guys
how does the /need command work
for example i want my server to click if they want queue ping role or not
-d need
i meant as if they want to take ‚Äúqueue ping‚Äù role
or not
so that they can choose
I just showed u what /need does,
If u want a reaction for example to gain or not a role you can use reaction add command
-d reactionroles add
it says either it got no perm
or that message doesn‚Äôt exist
i dont get it lol
tag me when you do respond please
The bot doesnt have permissions to give roles in your server then
like this pops up
i gave it administrator
might not be possible right ?
You need to copy the message id
so it can actually do that ?
so players would get ‚ÄúQueue Ping‚Äù role if they react to a certain emoji
Go to your account settings > advanced > activate developer
Then hold the message > scroll down > copy message id
And paste it to the `message_id:`
then to `reaction` add an emoji
hey i did thanks very much
So the bot is saying to "Keep these Captians?" but when you vote for no, they get picked. It's asking to randomize them but it's saying this
Thats not the original label, so the owner must have premium to customize these
The original label says "Randomize Captains?"
Ahh. How would one go about changing this back?
Can you customize it?
I should be able to, I just don't know where or how
Then you can use override command
-d language override set
Thank you!
Hello

If we don‚Äôt play

Uhm no
Is that the reason?
<@648635725964902411>
By default, no one will be shown in leaderboard without at least 1 game played
Oh Alr
Can u add me just in case I have inquires?
And also if u do the
If u do /map selection
U said, how many many r picked which isn‚Äôt correct
And when I try to do random and then check /info
Irs always picking the map by least amount of votes
<@648635725964902411> also I‚Äôm trynna replicate discord pl
What would I do, do I just noy set a best out of?
Just ask here
What do you mean, it says Random, vote or least
basically when i try to do /mapselection
its like 3 options to pick from
and a issue wiht that one is that, the description of the command is wrong
but the main issue is that the 3 options doesnt rlly exist
LIKE the first part gives 3 option which are
vote
random
least frequent
and when i try to do random on my own
and then i do /info to check it
it shows least voted
How is it wrong?
Can you show me
yea sure
Let me send thr pics when I can
<@648635725964902411>
Tried to do random for lap selection
Map*
And on the end it‚Äôs this
ALSO for best of 1, it will pick 1 map right?
and if I change it to best of 3, it will pick 3 maps for me)
Youre confusing the commands
Oh how so
Best of is not Map Selection, its a different command
I thought best of was just related to the map
Its related of how much games are needed to win to gain the mmr
And is there a way to check ur current map pool?
So let‚Äôs say I change it to 3 and I have random map
What will happen?
Tap the right arrow on the /info, till you see the map section
Then 3 maps will be chosen to play 3 games
Oh so for mine, I want to to be discord pl yk
So I should just keep 1 then
I don‚Äôt have anything there other than no bans for each team
Oh i thought map selection was available to see
Also u guys put the map selection description wrong
It shouldn‚Äôt be - how many maps do u want to be chosen
It should be
How should thr maps be chosen
Also what is the point of the point system again?
Where does it say that?
points or mmr
Points
Yeah, the command is to determine how maps are gonna be selected
Whats wrong?
It‚Äôs not how it is tho, it‚Äôs how the maps are gonna be selected
Because thr bo3 ^ determine how many maps r selected
And the command above determines how
Whether random or vote yk
Im not really following
Dont know what you mean
Basically
The best out of # determines how MANY maps will be chosen
And the map selection commands chooses how the maps will be chosen
Meaning this should have, chooses the amount of maps you want for the description
And this is, chooses how the maps will be chosen for thr description
Not really, best of just means how many games are going to be played and the best of X wins. You cant make the description about just the map
You can add both Alr
"Chooses how the maps will be chosen" and "Choose how maps are selected" is the same thing
Best Of by itself its pretty clear
Wait
I‚Äôm blind
üò≠I thought I said, how many maps sorry abt that
<:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
Other question is, wtf is points
Like isn‚Äôt mmr basically the only thing u need
For my case, where I‚Äôm trynna make a discord pl replica for free
All I need is to track elo or mmr
Yeah dont worry, points are not much in use right now, you can either give a role based on points, or a queueentry price with them
Oh so basically points is a useful function but u can give roles
Is there a way we can not track them?
Like disable
You can do points change win and point change lose
And set them to 0
Alr tysm, and last of all
Manage stats reset
Basically clears all of thr stats each player has
<@648635725964902411> ?including wr
Oh Alr
And just thought abt it
When u do stats
It doenst give an option for which queue
Is that intentional?
And it asked me to do stuff
Or is it only cus I have more than 1 queue available
Yeah, you can only run those commands on a queue channel or a linked channel to that queue
It will show the stats of that specific queue
What if my queue channel is called A and I want to have a specific place for checking Andy‚Äôs
You can make a channel to check stats for that queue, /link
Oh for leaderboard, idk how to do it. Can u tell me how to?
Cus I want it to be like the bot would run /leaderboard (user sets every how any minute) in a specific channel
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
Alr I will look into this tysm
Uh I looked into it, I don‚Äôt get how to enable an automatic leaderboard
Its by default
Like it‚Äôs gonna update itself?üò≠
Basically this is all I need
???? And when ppl start playing it will update
Or do I need to click that reload button
Holy ily for this free botüôè and the help
All thanks to NeatZ
Ily yall
<@648635725964902411> erm since ur still online
for the bot, is there a command to see the map pool or the maps you added so far?
If u added maps you will see them in /info
Page 4
yo <@648635725964902411>
you here ?
i need u rn
so apparently i forgot teamselection command to setup,and i want people who have highest mmr/elo to choose first in the queue,what option do i select in teamselection
alr ill check
Do you already have captains mode?
You want the captain to be highest, or the first one to draft to be the highest
so everyone is sitting at regular elo rn
so yeah i got captains on it
but can i do it without ppl voting ?
without ppl choosing 2 high rated
because i want that to be from default
so it automatically begins a match determining captains as 2 highest rated without anyone actually voting for that opinion
`/teamselection set` > Captains
`/captains selection` > Highest Rated
`/captains firstpick` > Highest Rated
last command is that captain with highest elo chooses first right ?
If u dont want it, then obv dont run it
it again popped up
with all options
even tho i did all commands you told me
are you using the commands in the correct queue channel?
yeah
no wait
i did it in like other channel
has to be channel where queue is ?
alright thanks for helping me with thing above
i just need this as well
for example i want guys who fall below 1000 to automatically get bronze role
so basically to give them roles based on their elo
i alr got roles created
-d autoroles mmr
does mmr number get taken away if someone is given a staff role?
or admin role in a discord
why would it?
unless u set it
there is no set ?
<@901199744645357568>
no, theres no way to configure losing MMR when you lose a role
what set
losing MMR makes you lose roles via autoroles, not the other way around
<@145305657237700608> no i mean next to their name
so like
clutch acadmey 77
ohhhh
rank
its a nick name
so i assume not
it goes awasy when given a staff role
if the staff role is higher than the bot in the role hierarchy, the bot wont be able to nick name them
but theres no special logic to remove nicknames from staff
gotcha
so move bot up
<@145305657237700608> https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/910981294937210930/1213918242674835507
i¬¥m using a bot to manage matches using some of this endpoints what can i do if they are remove
<@648635725964902411>
How can we change this?
And I enabled map voting by accident, how do I delete it
Or disable it
teamselection
mapselection
bot is lagging hella lol
My bot stopped playing helllpppp
Any comand responding
Doesn‚Äôt work
I tried /disable mapselection
And it won‚Äôt work
That command doesnt even exist
Yea?
Then how do I change itüò≠üò≠
I accidentally did map voting false then all
Mapselection and change it like u did
Can u send me a pic?
I don‚Äôt get it
I got this down I think
just run /mapselection
`/map selection`
And then random?
I assume
Alr so when I do /mapselection and then random
Will it automatically disable map voting?
Also what does the account age do?
Is that like discord account
if i dont want the vc to be required to start but still be there incase teams want it
\
The vc is to verify all 6 players r there
<@648635725964902411>
Hello soo I have 2 matchmaking channels (na and Emea)
And I have a channel to run commands such as /ign
Would that be possible for that single channel to link to both regions or not?
Also what does /register do
-d readyup mode
You can choose readyup button
So you can for example type your account of Valorant or Rainbow 6 or you can manually set an api, and it will pull the mmr from that
Goes along with requireregister
Oh but what‚Äôs thr poling
Point
Oh ok, so I need separate channels?
Pull the real mmr from your account
Many servers are Valorant or Rainbow, Overwatch, etc. If they want their real mmr to queue, they can do it like that
Isn‚Äôt that the same as their stats?
So let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm trynna make a ‚Äúpl‚Äù
Server basicslly, I would need to have them do /register.
I don‚Äôt rlly get it sorry
Ah and what‚Äôs thr command ans what would ppl need to put in thr command
<@648635725964902411> .
<@648635725964902411> HELP csn u teach me how to set up /register?
yo i wanna make a role that can join already channel that was queued just to spectate and stay muted
any way how can i do this
There is a spectator command
<@648635725964902411> hello pls helpüôèüôè
wha is it
It‚Äôs /spectatorrole add
Smth liek that dude
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/?id=game-integrations
Uhh I don‚Äôt get it
I tried and idk how astill
Do you even need that?
Idk wtf register rlly does
I mean if it makes an impact on setting up my discord pl I wanna add it
i recommend not using it
Then why...
It sets each players' MMR to be their in game rating from the actual game
I asked what it is and u didn‚Äôt explain it rlly well
Alr nvm
just let everyone start at the same MMR and they will get their deserved MMR after playing matches
still my ppl can't join
U add a role and u give that role to pplüíÄ
Ywa it‚Äôs like /set mmr and then mmr gain
i mean that ppl that already got spectator role cant join
<@1162398185692598392> inv me to ur server and give perms
Let me help set it up
Did a new match start after you set the role?
Alr I‚Äôll check
Ah, since my game is brawl stars. That doenst work?
No for doenst work?
it doesnt work, its not an option for the requireregister command
Oh ok
Also just cus I‚Äôm a bit slow
wtf is configure
configure?
not sure what you mean
Config command
Like /config save
And then I added NA PL and EMEA PL
config = configuration, the queue configuration
And idk wtf that foes
Uhm what does that mean?
Like how the queue is set?
Soo since I saved it as NA PL
yes, the queue configuration/setup/settings
What does that exactly mean? üò≠üò≠
Oh ok
All u see in /info is the configuration of your queue
Basically all of my set up is saved in a box called ‚ÄúNA PL‚Äù
Ah Alr
And is there a way to copy and paste that in another server
Another channel mb
Since I saved my matchmaking channels as NA PL and EMEA PL
just as u did config save, you can do config load
Ah Alr
And all the info is gonna be copy and pasted basically
Alr tysm
<@1162398185692598392> yo inv me to ur server if u still need help with thr spectator thing
they can join queue but not when we pick players and when game starts
they can join when we are about to pick
If i use crosschat, is it possible to tag an role from other server? dont want to ping "@everyone" everytime i announce pickups in #pickups channel.
ive never actually tried
if you have the role ID you can try mentioning it directly
like "@(id)"?
`<@&123>` <@&123>
I think ive tried that
lemme check again
yea im not sure what would happen tbh
on the left is server 1, on right is server 2
yes works
<@901199744645357568>
and how do i set that their elo/mmr is displayed before their discord username
u can check my server
i did that
i mean whats the command to do it
```/ratinginname format format: location: ```
<@1162398185692598392>
what is format format about to mean
i mean what shall i choose
Theres options when u type any command, it has all the explanations
what symbol do i choose
i dont gett that
lets say i wanna do it like this
im sure u know what i mean
i aint english so that its hard for me to understand
The command description says
-d ratinginname format
<@145305657237700608> the v2 api endpoints are still working?
i did,elo still doesn't display next to their discord
for some reason everyone else gets the nicknames changed for elo just fine except the staff
what do i do
also
whenever i try to register
it says i need to register externally or through an admin
<@648635725964902411> can you help a boy out
The Bot cant change the discord's admin server's nickname, and if the role of neatqueue is lower than the staff role, then it cant either
i see
They set /requireregister to Manually
yeah i did that
its set to manually
why cant it do this?
Discord
so what would the course of action be here
what should i be doing
Yeah
Then, its manually
or not at all
how do i solve it not changing the nicknames for staff; and how would i solve the registry issues
you cant
Discord doesnt allow it
that blows
what would be the workaround for this
sorry
i should rephrase
im not good at phrasing lol
what do you think i should do just turn registry req off?
If u dont need it, or dont want it then yes
is there other ways the elo suffix nickname will pop up without using registry
You dont need to register for that
Just use the ratinginname commands
i see
thanks
what does the registry even do
out of curiousity
if you dont need it, dont use it
most servers should not use it
im confused isnt that what the mmr commands do?
shouldnt use a command that you dont even know what it does üò≠
fair enough
i read that it intializes mmr and starts to track it
so i thought i needed it
But you can pull your mmr from a game that has MMR if u want it
i see
But you dont want it
so if it has a number in the game it can register over
to the discord bot
fair enough
thanks
For example pulling it from your valorant account
i see okay that makes sense
sorry if i seemed like stupid i just was confused i started using this bot today and these were the only issues i seemed to be having
but its all set now
<:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>
does this mean
the owner of the discord cant be assigned the suffix
because of discord?
no one can change the discord owner's nickname
i see
the party feature does not work if we dont enable button to join
is it possible to let players join the queue only after joining the voice channel while the party system isnt affected
how does starting mmr priority work with a specfic role vs everyone?
like if I want 7 roles to have different starting MMRs and then everyone else not with that role a default MMR
yo guys
i need help displaying their elo next to their name
on discord
just send me out fully what i need to type
pleae
on leadeboard it doesnt appear
+ we already tagged u with the command
yeah i know
i executed the command
it still doesnt appear
idk why
inv me to ur server
on dms or <#1116094649048760442>
check dms
hhow many queues can thhis run (free version)
Can i disable that the team channels dont get delete when these are empty?
How do i allow people to use the command /party create
Thats an user command
They can use it
If u didnt deactivate it in server integratioms
I dont know why people cant use the commands
how do i activate it back?
Server integrations
Still doesnt work
weird
Oh, took a while to allow, i just gave permission to x role to use commands
Is there a command to prevent anyone from writing to the queue?
is it possible for people that didnt pop into the queue, to be unable to join the queue vc?
I want to set two queue  on my server with diferents leaderboards, but when i test the two queues are on the same leaderboard aways, and not appears on the list of choose aways appears "player_stats"
`/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide toggle:Disabled`
Thankss
Oh no, Still cant, what I must wrong ?
Just type the queue name
Dont need it to show up
Oh ok it worked thanks
what do u mean typing to the queue, typing in the channel?
yes, but people who can join that are problaly people who have admin or mod perms
the bot does it by default
That's right, do not write in the queue that is created since the corresponding votes are carried out there.
Just disable the perms to type of the category where the channels will be created
no intiendo la pergunta
I have to do it every time a queue is created.
Changing the **category** perms?
how do i invite the bot to my server and how do i set it up for ELO and ranked matches
ive never used bots before so u know my expirience level
Here is a basic straightforward guide
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
loaded it in and got this
tried to make a queue
nvm working now
will it automatically create a new queue when the old one is filled
old one?
so like if 2 people enter a match
would more people be able to start a new match while the others are still going
The queue just will create games everytime its filled
so theres a thing where being higher or lower ELO gives you a different role right?
ive made the roles but not sure how to do it
just put the role, the lower value to get it, i.e 500, and the upper value is that you lose that role if u hit that mmr
so if i put (beginning role) 0 and 1500 then you would need to get to 1500 to get to the next role
or 1501 techincally
and only one allowed means you wont keep the old one when you switch?
not sure because its saying "games" instead of "ELO"
i should be using mmr instead of games
did a fake match to test out the bot
is there a way to manually change ELO
so i can set us both back to 1000
ill check the guide
-d mmr change
You can also reset stats
-d managereset stats
can someone help me set this queue up for bo6 8s, im so lost with tryna add map pools and gamemodes
I did /setup and its not giving anything back to me
hey I have a question, is there any way to sort balancing based on roles different from what i understood the documentation to mean

lets say we're using it for agame that has the trinity class system, 

so we want to run inhouses but want tomake sure theres an equal number of tanks, healers and dps - is this achievable by giving users a role that represents them and having the bot balance it by roles?
make sure the bot has perms to send messages
-d roles
Yep I gave the boy admin and it fixed everything
thank you o7
its on the command doc
hey, i dont think i'm getting it right with the ai bot.

my current issue is with the queue ending right after everyone got moved to the temporary channels. it seems like it's finishing right after it starts, and everyone is moved out of the queue
wdym finishing?
I have a bunch of people stuck at 1000 MMR on the leaderboard but when doing /stats it shows a different value, any reason why this is happening?
Is there a way to have server roles impact or adjust MMR?

When people join our server they select what their current rank is (Halo Infinite). It would be nice if the higher rank that is selected somehow either assigns a higher MMR or something that doesn‚Äôt start them at the base MMR. It makes for some team imbalance currently.
Would it be /startingmmr set and then set the starting MMR higher for each increasing rank?
If yes, then what happens when people update their rank server roles? Does it reset their MMR to that startingmmr number?
<@145305657237700608> hey, there is this problem that started 6h ago that when people join the voice channel they aren‚Äôt able to join in the queue. Does this mean we have to buy the premium version? We have around 410 people in 3weeks and less than 50matches a day
But we are able to join the queue if we add button
why cant they join? what do you mean
Two Questions!
- How do I reset the match number that my queue is on? (because ive done tests and its on like 7 right now and id like to reset that)
- Also... Say I have an 8 man queue, that one fills up and starts... will another queue be able to fill via the same join queue and start its own thing?
First, not ppssible
Second, yes
> Also... Say I have an 8 man queue, that one fills up and starts... will another queue be able to fill via the same join queue and start its own thing?

If you have your queue set up to create a temp channel/lobby to put people in, yes.
How do I make a voting menu result change a queue setting like best of 3 or best of 5?
I think I already found the answer. It's in the `/bestof` "vote" option. Correct?
I have a bunch of people stuck at 1000 MMR on the leaderboard but when doing /stats it shows a different value, any reason why this is happening?
prolly cuz of underage
Do you have more queues?
I enabled monthly queues but disabled it and it didn't fix it, also made sure it's using the same shared stats as the queue
the leaderboard and /stats do not sync the right MMR but the w/l is correct
Bumping my previous ask:

> **Is there a way to have server roles impact or adjust MMR?** (Note: not the other way around which utilizes autoroles)
> 
> When people join our server they select what their current rank is Halo Infinite's Ranked Arena playlist. It would be nice if the higher rank that is selected somehow either assigns a higher MMR or something that doesn‚Äôt start them at the base/starting MMR. The default settings create some serious imbalance for new players.
> Is the answer using `/startingmmr set` and then setting the starting MMR higher for each increasing rank?
> If yes, then what happens when people update their rank server roles? Does it reset their MMR to that startingmmr number?
just do like /register
meaning they need to register their acc to the game and then it will automatically
unless thats not a game
offered by /register
<@648635725964902411> do u know how i get premium
at the current moment i am having an issue where people who are not currently in the queue are able to join

and the 10 people in the queue are unable to start the match due to them not being able to join the vc

is there a way to make it so that ONLY the people in the queue can join?
or to let more people join the vc
by default the bot will only allow the players to join the queue
check the created channel permissions to see what is incorrect, that will give an idea of what is changed
<@857633321064595466> premium
> ### How to get premium
> 1) Login at https://www.neatqueue.com
> 2) Click the Dashboard tab
> 3) Select your server
> 4) Purchase credits and/or select a plan
you are correct on using `/startingmmr`
once a player gets their starting MMR, it won't be assigned again, so it doesnt matter if they change roles
by default `/stats` will show all time stats i believe
the leaderboard should show all the months as well, perhaps they have 1000 mmr for some month?
I have the monthly leaderboards turned off and their MMR is just stuck at 1000
and the same channel shows different MMR on /stats and /leaderboard ?
<@145305657237700608> my leaderboard reset when i woke up and the games did not carry on from the old one how do i fix that
Did you change the queue name?
no i didn‚Äôt i just readded the wins im worried that its gonna reset again tomorrow
check your /logs for any command usage
theres nothing automatic about the bot that it would reset stats
is it possible to reset stats like games wins etc but keep the mmr of each player?
set games, set wins, set losses
ok well it should stay the same
i haven‚Äôt changed anything i just manually readded everything
i took screen shots so it shouldn‚Äôt happen again
is the bot down rn or something
Nope
is there any command to do happy hour in the bot?
its make it private
<@648635725964902411> my bots like frozen
or <@145305657237700608>
everything not working
Same
so if I do the /leaderboard command, the embed shows the correct MMR and win / loss. but the website leaderboard has a bunch of people stuck at 1000 MMR and this never changes but their W/L does. 
take a look at player ``e, HuggingThor, nate`` for example. 
I run the command in the channel linked to the proper queue and monthly is disabled.
Can you send me the link of the lb
hi I dmed it
Hmm yeah thered something going on, stuck or something
gotta wait till neatz can see
if you give me the link I can take a look
https://www.neatqueue.com/leaderboard/932865045283631155/1282141043957039104
the bot is bugged it say
we are already in a queue
but we are not in a queue
how i can fix that?
<@145305657237700608>
it seems that the leaderboard is combining stats for the previous months even though its now disabled, ill probably have to revisit this logic
for now, you should be able to run `/managestats reset all queue_name:Jan 2025: player_stats` or something similar, the queue_name should pop up automatically
ok this cmd won't affect the main leaderboard/stats?
okay running that did not fix the lb
i wonder if it's just cached in
i still see the january stats
did the queue name pop up automatically?
I dont think I typed the correct queue name
I reset Jan 2025: playerstats and did the confirm prompt
but nothing really changed
hmm it should be Jan 2025: player_stats
yeah it does not show up with the _
strange, type it manually
yeah that is weird but it seems to have worked now cool
thanks
no prob
hey, when players create a party they are unable to join the queue by the vc mode
is there a fix other than adding the join button?
<@145305657237700608> my boy fully frozen
Wdym frozen
Hey, not sure if anyone can help but one of our members doesn't see the pop up, only sees the buttons "Join Queue" or "Leave Queue"
Have to them check their discord settings for ‚ÄúShow embeds‚Äù
Will do, thank you
can you set the minimum ammount of elo that you MUST lose when you lose a game
<@145305657237700608>
how can I make it so players cant see the "join queue" channel at all if they are currently in a game?
no there‚Äôs no hard set value for a minimum
you could add an /autoroles ingame, and change the queue channel permissions to deny that role from viewing it
could you elaborate more? There‚Äôs nothing about parties that would be different from normal players for viewing stuff
Since I set everyone at 0
And people just lose 0 sometimes
did you set a minimum MMR?
people shouldn‚Äôt lose 0
Uhm yes
Minimum mmr
But that‚Äôs like the minimum mmr u can gain
There‚Äôs two ways of joining a queue right? Either by clicking the join queue button or by joining the voice channel. But we removed the button option as it creates problem in our project.
But then when people create a party and join voice channel, the bot does not detect them and do not take the players in the party in the queue
hmm i‚Äôll have to check it out
<@145305657237700608> the button im here! for afk never work
Okay, why would the bot not be giving people mmr but it is taking the mmr away?

basically the bot isn't giving mmr on a win but is taking away mmr on a loss. And I haven't the slightest clue
Do /info and go to page 3, what does the mmr change says?
Average on win 50
Average on loss 50
How do I do omit?
my /auto roles set mmr isnt working rn, its giving people random roles and not handing out roles when people rank up / down
any advice?
Hi, I'm currently trying to buy the Professional plan but it's not letting me do it sice it says "Please invite NeatQueue bot to your server". Idk what to do since the bot is already in the server and it's apparently not working. I've waited +5 hours and it still doest work. If someone can help it'd be good
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>
what server?
it surely isnt random, check your /info and see what your autoroles config is
My Discord Server
have u tried /channel restrictions mode:?
Is there an way to change  "Player Joined Queue!" to be "Player Joined Match!"
also for left queue to left match too
i tried language override but didnt work
Language override is the command
Did u forget to toggle them?
no i didnt forget
i changed every message that had queue to "Match", and i double checked
Found the solution, when searching for word queue it doesnt actually say every phrase that has Queue in it
its letting anyone with the queue role to join
How is the balanced team selection asigning teams by mmr? How does it calculate? An average? A sum?
average
Hey guys
Question, so basically i have 3 different queues.

4v4 / 3v3 and 2v2.
When i try to link the leaderboard to 2v2 or 3v3 or 4v4 the games played on 4v4 also count in the 2v2 leaderboard
If someone knows how to fix, would be helpful
Hey Guys, 
Can somebody help me out??? 

I just need to know if your bot creates a custom game lobby for league of legends 5v5 and how this is sent onto players? <@145305657237700608>
Thanks
All this happens within discord
Nothing goes outside discord
You have a basic guide to create a queue in this channel's description
Ok I see, 
So the bot will not create a lobby for league of legends! 
It will create the voice channels and then up to the players to organise themselves ? 

Fantastic, 
My final question... I have certain categories I want the voice channels created in... How do I set the creation of voice channels to a differnt category in discord ?
Can I have run seperate leaderbaords ? <@648635725964902411>
You can with /channel category
And yeah you can run different leadearboards but not of the same queue
Hey good night, I need help
I can't figure out how to make all the ones that are in voice chat join automatically the queue without need to click join button
-d channel entry
It's not working
Is there any other command I guess
No, thats the command
also need
-d queueentry methods
is the bot down
Yeah
ah okay
Aight thank you
## I need someone to help run a scrim setup. It‚Äôs gonna blow up, I just quit from working from a scrim server with over 1k members for Fortnite ballistic dm me if interested
is there any command which lets some user to have less -elo when they lose
You mean loss less elo
Not really, if you talking abt maybe a role that will be specific, nope
but we can increase some people‚Äôs elo right
so if we wanna let someone have loss less elo
we can give them the same amount of elo manually
-d mmr multipliers set
you can assign their role to a multipler of say `.9` and they should lose 10% less
although ive never tried
well, makes sense
but then they would gain less elo aswell if they win

Seems like your server has premium now, does the website not show that?
i dont think so, It says extennnt elc but its nnot showing any dashboard on ut
can you screenshot and send it
either here or in DMs
<@145305657237700608>
thats what i  see when i hit dashboard
That looks good, your server has Enterprise for a month
but does that not mean i get a dashboard
<@145305657237700608>
There is no other dashboard
<@607374571405836338> Do you got dms open?
so its all commands ngl a scam
yes thats what it says in the plan description
im curious to know what the confusion is
So when it says pick map I cant change that
to pick gun?
everything is through commands
if you mean for the lobby to vote on what gun to use, then you can do that
-d votingmenu add
But what command to chnage that i looked
Got a idea for what to do if I wanted to set up three queues, starting with 1v1s, a custom where anyone cna join at anytime, and a offcial queue which would only be accessable whenn staff host?

Hi Admin, 
I am having an issue where my leaderboard does not display when m,y queue is inactive. 
Fixes?
Hello guys, if I add a spectator role the VCs don't have a limit no more, but everyone can join, is there a way to let only the people with the role join the VC?
Is there a way to leave the victory vote for later as a standing by, so that the admin can check them and accept them all together? And keep the matches going
<@648635725964902411> hey, is it necessary to have administrator perms to score match results?
you can let people requeue without needing to vote
-d requeue condition
you can also change it so only admins can select the winner
-d winnermessage results
no, the players in the match can vote for the winner
Yo I'm trying to figure out how to basically make a seperate leaderboard for an existing queue.  Having trouble finding the command for this in the documentation.  Anybody know how to do this?
<@145305657237700608>
What do you separate?
Well I'm doing kind of a 8s CoD tournament sort of thing today where the top 3 players at the end of the day get a cash prize, so I want to make a separate leaderboard for loaded config so that I can display all of the MMR the players get today go on a seperate leaderboard so we can keep track
<@648635725964902411>
When voting yes, it remakes the randomizer, it's reversed
Not really reversed, you just have to understand the question they are asking
We get that alot in our server too
but what they are asking is, "do you want to randomize the captains again?"
<@430235311642116098>
Ohhhhh
That's true
Lmaoooo
yeah lol
Anybody got any info on my question above? I've tried pretty much all of the settings I could think of in the documentation with no luck <@857633321064595466>
Youll need to name the queues differently
You cant have separate leadearboards of the same queue
Youll need to create another one can be the same config, but with diff name

hey is there some server issue going on right now? the queue that I'm running on my server is stuck on full and the bot isnt responding when i clear the queue
Is the bot broken? Unable to do commands or join queues, also ai support not working
yea same for my server
Bot is off ? It doesn't let me join queue not even vc chat or button queue
Ah yeah I see
Update - The bot seems to be working now, players can now join queues, and admins can run commands.
Is it possible to assign Discord Roles when players are InQueue, InGame and then remove those Roles when they are not in Queue or Not in Game?
never mind /autoroles should work for anyone wondering
how can you disable all voice channels? I have managed to disable the team voice channels but not the setup voicechannels
-d lobbychannel toggle
Thank you!
did the bot stop working rn
bruh
yeah aint working for me
confirm the bot is off
How can I make the bot ping a role when someone joins a queue?
Not possible
Unlucky but thanks for the answer ‚ù§Ô∏è
wait i think this works
not even with /need?

Reset leaderboard weekly?
What do u mean
Is there a way how I can set a leaderboard to monthly but set it to reset like every monday instead of the first of the month
Not that straightforward
You coul achieve it using schedule commands
-d schedule
how do i add back vote captains and randomized captains?
Opposite way of how u removed them
Instead of not selecting it in teamselection, select it
oh okay okay thank you
for some reason when the teams are made they don't get sent to separate team voice calls it just keeps them in the voice calls

What do you mean coach??
I mean report a game

Just vote
Or do you want that only some people can vote the winner?
I want a team with me to give them a role to report a game
<@648635725964902411>
then you would have to put the results to staff only, first, you need to set up a staff channel, `/staff channel set`, give only permissions to people you want to be able to see this channel, then you will need to set `/message winnermessage results` to Staff only, and the results will be sent to this channel, so you can decide the winner there.

Can you make it so winners stay on
How do you do rematch avoidance
So players can queue against each other again for awhile.
What do you mean
-d rematch toggle
will it prevent players from queuing into each other accidently?
as far as i know that reads as it removes the button to ask for a rematch
Theres not a way to do avoid two players facing eachother
The only case would be that their mmr is far away, and you could set your queue to matchmaking, this meaning it will search for players with close mmr to start the game
Okay added a <#911057745204105237>
So after a team scores (example team one or team 2) who won, can you make it so the team that one stays queued in the bot and doesnt have to re queue?
Not really
Heey! How can I balance the queue? Try putting the /balancebytype MMR command and keep matching those who have more mmr together
Thats basically the only command

Since the <#1131752660740083763> is not currently working, I will ask here:

Is there a command to move a player from one team to another team (i.e., from team A to team B) when they have chosen the wrong team? I realize they can do this manually but there are times where it is easier to just move them rather than explain the whole thing to them.
FYI, the <@1131749637406064721> bot suggested a [command that doesn't exist](https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/1131752660740083763/1334257036900302908).
yea it does that quite a bit for some reason
no there is not
Thanks for the reply. Much appreciated.
How do I change permission for this bot in my server
<@145305657237700608>, sorry to bother you but is there a way to make it so only people in a certain voice channel can join an active queue other than using the /startfromvc command and setting up a whole new queue
so only the people in the VC have access to the queue?
Yeah
you can restrict the VC with normal discord perms and then use
-d queueentry methods
change it to "Voice Channel" and use
-d queueentry channel
Perfect, thank you

How can I make that the ones that join queue they get into another vc queue private
I enabled the temp channels to queue and voting setup, how can I see what they're doing the voting and all as a administrator
Sometimes when the match is over and then everybody is moved again to the lobby channel, they don't get into the queue automatically, they gotta leave and enter again, can we fix it?
You just get 2 types of vcs, team vc, and queue vc
Just enter the channel and see what they are doing(?, or if u wanna have a log of the match, you can set up a staff channel
You dont need to fix it because its not intended to be like that, match is over, you have to queue again
Yes I got a problem with like 20 persons joining and leaving and pressing the button join and it got a mess, at the end everyone left and no one played
What does that have to do with the vc?
Cuz I wanted it private and only the ones that joined first queue can see the vc Chanel
Theres no vc channel if the queue didnt start yet
Maybe move then to another vc and they gotta join lobby again, so they don't get confused
And how can I buy premium
You can make them not return to the lobby channel
`/lobbychannel returnall`
<@857633321064595466> premium
> ### How to get premium
> 1) Login at https://www.neatqueue.com
> 2) Click the Dashboard tab
> 3) Select your server
> 4) Purchase credits and/or select a plan
Thank you, it's done, I bought it, I appreciate your help
And can I make them return to like another vc channel, kind of prelobby
Hey I've had some issues with certain bad actor players trying to ruin the experience for others. Specifically, when there are enough players in queue (lets say 6, for my queue games must be played 3v3, 4v4, or 5v5), the bad actor joins queue to make it imbalanced. Then if another player joins to make it 8, the bad actor leaves. So if none of my staff is around to ban the player from queue, he can completely shut down games. Is there anything that I can do to prevent this? Maybe a command to make it if a player joins and leaves queue a certain amount of times in a set period of time, they get a short temp ban?
How can I cancel the test mode
that‚Äôs an interesting idea, how often are they joining and leaving?
I havent seen it but I dont think they are completely spamming it. Probably varies in pace depending on how many people are in queue already. I'd assume it would have to be something along the lines of banning them if they join/leave queue X number of times before a game gets created
Also I think part of the issue for my case is that people can join the queue while a force start vote is ongoing, which cancels the vote instantly
So not only can they make the queue imbalanced, but they can just wait and snipe the queue
I wonder if it makes sense to block the queue if there is a forcestart vote?
Also your idea makes sense, maybe limit players who join/leave multiple times without it a match starting
Would definitely be a big help for us to have some customizable options for that. As our community grows, some people just like to troll lol
is this possible with neatqueue?
got an error when trying to run a tournament.
of 21 people
it says the bot was missing permissions to edit messages for some reason?
you can‚Äôt designate channels like that since each match will create the voice and text channels
So without the match room vc¬¥s?
the rest is fine
can i make an vc for 1v1 queue, vc team 1 1v1 queue, vc team 2 1v1 queue

Is there a way to give more mmr to the best players than others? Like being able to select them from best to worst?

queue with different names but still have the same stats.
hi, in my server when i try and make a new queue it says im only allowed 3 queues but i only have 2 operational, i was wondering if mabye there are queues that i need to delete that im not using?
but how would i delete the queue im not using?
you should be able to see it via

> ### How stats for a queue are linked

this seems to work partially
the issue is with the leaderboard
it only shows some of the players for some reason
weve had these 3 matches for example
and only 8 players on the leaderboard
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>
even have this on for all the queues
is there a role requirement for the queue?
Joined an 1v1 game through an vc, how am i supposed to choose the winner if the players dont appear on the message?
is this an bug report
this is the winners message
yes since there are 3 queues, there's roles assigned based on their in game ranks
should i remove the role requirements and change channel view perms instead?
How can i turn off this notification?
When I did this an unexpected error occurred
if the queue has a role requirement, then only people with that role will show on the leaderboard
you cannot
this looks like a bug, how did it happen?
This has been resolved
How do I enable to start the match without need to forcestart, I know it's /matchstart when mode:Queue Filled

But sometimes it doesn't start and everyone is on the voice chat and in queue
if your queue says "Matchmaking", then it will wait a bit to try and find more fair teams
change your /queuetype to PUGs to automatically start when filled
I'd wanna keep it mmrs scores, anyways on team selection they make it balanced with the captains..
Or do pugs give mmr also?
Or should I try the forcestart conditions and that?
only diff between PUGs and Matchmaking is how the match starts
I honestly dont know what exactly happend, i just know i changed the queue entry to vc then it started doing this
Hello! Is there anyway to force the bot to ping any users in queue, so that discord clients load the user into cache
algum adm br?
Neatz, if the queue type is "select team on join", how are people supposed to select the team through vc's?
they would get a DM but it probably won‚Äôt work
there‚Äôs a bit of an issue currently with the bot and DM interactions
Not really
Is there any other solution, like team 1 vc, team 2 vc
When u chose to only staff can vote for win, the mvp option doesn't appear anymore and u gotta do it manually with a command to give mvp, is there any other option?
Hi, i cant find, have we an option for mention full 10 ppl in match? not 1 by 1
Only if the 10 people had an specific role
Idk if that possible
You do can vote mvp when the results appear
How can I make the temp channel voice private so that others that are not in queue can't join
Thats by default
Unless you have a spectator role
Or disabled it
-d channel restrictions
Hmmmm that's weird cuz everyone was joining and only me has spectator role
You know the text channel is private but not the voice one
If u have a specator role set then its not private anymore
Nobody can't see text but voice yes
Ohhhhh, then if i have spectator role other people will be able to join the temp voice channel

How can i delete an queue ?

Got an way of doing it, they choose the team in the tempchannel with /teamselection, mode changed to PUG
If I use the `ordered` argument for `/gamemode selection` what order does it actually use? I don't see an option to select the order. 

More context: I would like to have modes be in a specific order, and then maps be selected by least frequent and remove voting on maps and modes all together to speed up the process.
it should pop up and ask you for the order after you use the command
I'll try that and report back if I have any issues. Thanks!
Yep. it works. Thanks again. Halo Infinite, sadly, makes it more complicated than I think I can configure in NQ. In a best of 5, the standard order is OBJ, Slayer, OBJ, OBJ, Slayer. Unfortunately, there are 5 OBJ modes. So, while I could define the two Slayers, I would not be able to define the others without leaving out two. I thought about defining the mode order and then creating custom vote menus for the three OBJs but that's not exactly simpler that just using mode voting. Open to any creative ideas I may be missing though!

And it doesnt allow me
what does your dashboard say?
29 days left for next payment
Now my queues stopped working idk why
what does it say in the queue
Doesnt detect any player players on queue
I'd have to manually add them
People are waiting to play and they cant join automatically
what about now?
Still doesnt work
can you invite me
Check dms
How do i see an list of all the queues  in my server?
is this two queues in the same channel?
Can i remove an specific party from a tournament? idk if its an bug but theres an party that doesnt even exist and its there
Those are not 2 queues
Its the same one
You cant have 2 queues in the same channel
Okay
is there a way to make the bot not force you into VCs when the game starts? I have a 1v1 for my discord and we just wanted to stay in the call without having to join the queue VC then get forced into another just to join back into the VC where everyone else is
The bot says it doesn't have Manage Channels permission. But when I checked, it had. I can't see the leaderboard or use any other command.
Is it a way to max people‚Äôs games/ queues? So you can only queue X amount of times.

Not really, you could implement a game autorole that will give a role once they reach n games, so you could ban the role from queueing
Alr, another question. Is it possible to make it so n mmr can queue with others around the same mmr? 

Kinda like skill based matchmaking in other games, like Fortnite.
-d queuetype
Matchmaking
Yeah yeah, but does that have skill based matchmaking? So you meet people with similar points.
hi guys, ive got a quick question. Is it possible to change the bot profile picture for the own server ?

Is the anticheat, an actual anticheat??
Since the game I play and host on, doesnt have an anticheat that works 100%.
What is it then?
There are a lot of options

Basically will work as a flagging system for certain actions
But not anything related to the game

Same to you,  teamselection
how abt the maps selction ? i was trying to add some and i was so confused
i want to allow certain roles to type /party create, but on server integrations it doesnt appear, only when people type /party create on the channel
unfortunately you can't use Discord's server integrations for that, all commands under `/party` are combined
you can try using
-d staffrole add
give it the "User Commands Only" template, then add the commands you wanna deny
-d staffrole commands deny
any updates?
Hi, is there a way to configure NeatQueue so that only the attacking team can vote for the map to be played? If so, which command should I use?
Howdy, is there anyway that we can wipe leaderboards entirely running money 8s queues and MMR determined brackets anyway to make this easy

you can manually do it via
-d votingmenu add
set the "team_voting" option
<@145305657237700608> why does the bot give ppl 1k mmr even tho it‚Äôs set to 35 to change
Yo
We want to report a bug
To remove peoples mmr because we want it at a certain mmr point
But the bot keeps giving the players 1k mmr
When were starting off at all 0
from scratch
Its a 2.5k Robux tournament prize
Why does the robot called "NeatQueue" give people one thousand mmr even though it is set to 35??!?!?
I Say Stop it robot
Robot no stop it

Would it be possible to add custom web requests to neatqueue events. I would like to hook in a new pug lobby with an api call to create a temporary server. Can this be done?
yes, there is webhook support
-d webhooks
click the command and the docs have the events
wow thank you
maybe im not familiar with webhooks enough but I have an api endpoint that creates a server when POSTed to. Using these webhooks how can I integrate a custom request that way. For example when I curl my endpoint I can pass in query params. Essentially I want to curl my endpoint with certain params when a pug is created, and the same when the pug is closed. Am I misunderstanding the purpose here?
From my current understanding, when an action is triggered in neatqueue, it will send my url an action. I can read that action and do something with it, but I wont have any params. Also the response contains the server password and I want that available to the players in that pug.
alguem pode me ajuda
you probably would have to send your own message in the channel
Do you mean a neatqueue message like /message? a request would look something like this ```curl -X POST "https://myapi.com/dev/pug?serverName=DefaultServer&serverMax=8&serverVoip=true" -H "x-api-key: <my-api-key>"``` When I first thought of this discord bot I was hoping there was a way to write custom commands like this embedded in events. Obviously the more I learn, the more I realize that isn't going to work.

Hii Al, after team is created/selected. what is the command so the bot choose randomize maps instead of this (pic attached) i tried / mapselection (random) but it still does the process of voting. i just want the bot to randomize the mao right away from it self

Hey, i would like to add a custom draft to my queue since the available drafts arent working that good for my server. i would like to have a 1-1-1-2-1 (lower mmr first picks) draft. i already used your ai support but it couldnt really help me with that. i checked the /votingmenu command as ai said but did not understand how to really do it with it. would appreciate if you could help me with it
Its not really possible to add a custom draft order
thats unlucky but thanks for your quick answer ü§ù

Is not possible just create text channel not voice channels
Hello! Is it possible to make 2 separate leaderboards within one server, each of which will be linked to its own queue?

I've been trying to do it myself by documentation for a few hours now and I've managed to make 2 different queues with different rules, but when starting any of them, the rating is summarized in the one leaderboard....
Did u enable serverwide stats?
Or are u spawning the leadearboard on the same channel
Is this some kind of command? I just haven't found any info on it.....

And no, I have two channels for two queue and two the channels to leaderborads with links (4 channels sum)
Are the queues named the same?
Nope
Do /info and go to page 3
Check if server wide is enabled
Oh, I did it!

I split each queue into a separate role and they split into different leaderborads. But now there's a problem.

I have Role #1 and Role #2, and if in one of the queues only Role #1 can participate and in the other one Role #1 and Role #2 can participate, then for the match in the queue where there are 2 roles, elo is given to both leaderboards.
Disable ir
`/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide toggle:Disabled`
Everything works now, thank you very much for your prompt help!
do someone have idea why my bot is canceling queues even when i setup a timer for 1 day?
are you in test mode still?
im fine rn
sry forgot to delete message
hello?

If I disabled all this will just stay the text channel ?
Is there a command to permanently ban a user?
without having to enter years, days or hours?
-d player ban
you dont have to specify the time
Can I schedule a command to run once a week instead of daily? I may just be confused with wording
How do I replace the panel in the first image so that only the captain voting at the start of the game remains?
-d teamselection
Hii I want to avoid having the same teams be match over and over we are doing full team vs full team the only thing I was thinking is just to do a requeue delay for 1 min and that way maybe avoid having same teams but do you have any feature to adjust the requeue delay for specific roles like for one role would be 1 minute for other one 2 minutes etc ?
Nope
What about the requeue priority can I maybe trigger something like I gave roles to the managers of their teams not every team and they can requeue before than the other ones
Is possible
Also when one person in all team party have that role will work even others in that party don‚Äôt have it?
Does anyone know how to make the winning vote require more than 1 vote?
I already tried with requiredvote winning
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608>
you probably have test mode enabled still
unless its a 1v1
each member of the party will have their own checks applied
so if someone can't requeue yet, it will block the party
Surely, thanks
Hello The AI Bot said that the /switch command would allow me to trade players from one team to another has the command changed since I tried it but It wasnt working
if i ban someone with the /player ban and this player quit and rejoin the  discord he gonna still have the ban?
sorry thats not a command
the only way to swap players is via /player sub or /substitute
Can you use Neat Queue in forum channels?
I dont see any /voicechannels mode command
did it get removed?
it was renamed into other commands
if you want spectators you should use
-d spectatorrole
thanks
/rolepersist
how about this command
That doesnt exist
oh ok
any solution for this : https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/1131752660740083763/1341822512920662040
Are we able to add status button on queue without being MatchMaking
If u just want a role that are for players that queue, then you can do an autoset role for people who have a game
`/autoroles games set`
only if you have /anonymousqueue enabled
Okay
im aware of that thanks, however my question/doubt is, is it possible to have the queue player role not be removed after the selection of teams?
like when you join a queue, you have the queue player role. When the teams go in their VCs they lose that role
is it possible somehow for them to have that role until the queue/match ends? instead of being removed as soon as they get dragged into their VCs
-d autoroles ingame
Hi, is there any way to create a Matchmaking Teams vs 4 Randoms?
or have different teamsizes in the same queue? example Team 1 (0/1) vs Team 2 (0/4)
Hello, i added bot to my channel and did /setup thingy, the question is , can i somehow remove the voice chat verification thingy ?
Howdy!
So I ran into an issue. A member apparently isn't voting for the winner. So the lobby is just stuck infinitely as I cant find a way to close the lobby / end the match. The other player who did vote is now stuck as he can't queue till the current lobby is dealt with. Kindle assist in the matter
By default people are only blocked until they submit their vote, not when the winner is picked, unless you changed the `/requeue condition`
you can manually resolve the match via `/outcome`
-d lobbychannel toggle
unfortunately no
Roger that!
Appreciate your prompt response and fabulous work with bot.
How long will the bot be down
for some reason my queue is saying force start disabled even though it isn‚Äôt
does / trade work ?
that command doesnt even exist
does the bot have a command that allows people to see when the last queue started?
no theres no such thing
thank you for the quick response
how would i make a queue like this? where you join as your "position" and then you choose teams after?
-d roles
How do you remove calls during the match?
How do I reset the leaderboard?
yeah i did that but how do i make it so that theres different amounts of players allowed in each?
Just type `/setup` and it'll give you many types of queues
Read the first argument: `Role,Role,Role` meaning if you want two spots for a role you would do for example: `Role1,Role1`
Any way to update the lb with the new set points I did for specific roles?
Leadearboard is automatically updated
Dont know what you mean
I mean can I manually do it?
What did u change
You can just hit the <:refresh:1021953798542991410>
The lb got completely wiped on accident
So I had to restore each role points accoddingly
I changed MMR per roles to my liking
But nobody is on the lb
So they gotta play again to update their points
But I don't like that since they get a incorrect role
And incorrect points due to the roke
Ah yeah, by default you need at least 1 game to show up on the leadearboard
So I wanna manually update the lb to set everyone with their roles to get the points accordingly
Much appreciated
You can either add a game, or set it to show without at least one game required
-d /leaderboardconfig requiredgames
Much appreciated

I tried with /endqueue

Thats the command
We have added so we can vote for maps ect, but nothing is popping up. yk why?
Probably permissions
On embed links
Or send msgs
just out of curiosity, could the bot create the voice channels with an user limit?   it would make it easier to quantify how many players have joined the vc
How can we fix it so it doesn't say no permission?

> - Category and channel permissions do not override the bot's permissions.

If u dont have a spectator role or disabled the channel restrictions, you should have a limit
How to set up autoroles for leaderboards position say mmr leaderboards? (I used the command ` /autoroles leaderboardposition ` but it didn't work)
Nope
Once the queue starts, you could

Thats the command for that
No, i mean, when the match starts
Is there a way to get rid of the website leaderboard for your channel
i want to have a Queue that essentially uses MMR as a hidden SBMM for making teams, and not used for stat tracking as that can push people away

Hey guys
i just got this bot, i was testing it out with my mods in mod chat, how do i stop the que? i set it up in the wrong channel, i have max 3 ques i can make but one is in my mods chat which i dont want

thanks
also had another question, How does this bot know who won or lost the match inside a valorant custom game?
how do i set this up
also i had selected, for the stats to be combined across the whole server, how do i make it where it is que or channel specific stats only not the whole server, because i have 3 regions and want stats for each region
<@648635725964902411>
The bot works on discord, it doesnt connect to any game
So the people playing needs to vote who won
ooooh
i see
so it is manual
how would the players do this? or does the admin do this
Once the setup is done, it displays a votement message
sorry im a total noob at discord bots
and trying to add this to my server
is really hard
If u have all the stats combined theres not a way to show individual stats like that
how do i change it
to make it que specific
or not across the whole server
because when i /setup
it asked and i press yes by accident
i wanted no
`/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide toggle:Disabled`
will it automatically trigger que specific stats? once i enter this?
how do i add que names? <@648635725964902411>
or remove them from the saved names
also can i make it so once the que is full its automatically, captains and Mmr enabled? they dont have to vote on this or no?

You have a basic guide if u wanna see: https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
wait when i type /startque and select que name, there are only 2 que names and i cant make a new one
how do i make it so that que name i want is saved ?
even if i make a new que with a different name it doesnt get saved
Just type the name that u want
but its not saving
i want to link the stats to a que name
but the que name is not saving
If a que is full and starts a match, will it automatically go back to open que?
for example 10/10 will the que go to 0/10?
How do i enable this?

Hello. We want to test NextQueue for our server. Is there a free tier? How can I create a demo/free version
yes there is a free tier which is usually good for most servers
Nice, I see we have to set it up with the ./setup command. Missed it because I was reading to fast üôÇ Thanks!
<@648635725964902411> If i end a que and start a new que
will all the configs be saved? Like Map bans, Captain draft settings and mmr settings
A new queue is a new config, so no
how do i save the config?
there is a way right
-d config save
but you should just leave the queue running forever
Do you happen to know why when I create a que it doesn't display within the leaderboard selection?

Is there a way to use autorole to give a specific role to only the top 4 ranked players on the leaderboard?
Oh I got it, I need to use the lower and upper range
I just ran this command in our server and all players with over 1100 ELO instantly dropped to 1100 (the minimum I'd chosen). Did I do something wrong or is it glitched?
(As in, players dropped 600+ ELO instantly)
when was their last matches?
Over 86400 seconds ago, so it made sense that they decayed.

Oh, are you saying that they decayed by 15 for every 86400 seconds they hadn't played? Meaning it retroactively applied the decay, and players who hadn't played for a month lost all of their elo?
Well, I guess I will manually re-input everybody's ELO to get back to where it was. Is there a spot I can find that, or will I need to go through our #matchresults channel to find every player's most recent ELO?
i have a question
do i need to add maps per channel/que
or once i add the maps it will go to all ques, im assuming i have to individually add them every que right?
also for the MMR disable setting if i disable it, does that mean it will be automatically MMR enabled in the matches
Can I increase the room more than 6?
<@145305657237700608>
Hey im having a problem
i want when the que is full to be only captains mode they dont select anything else, but when i use captain selection command it doesnt work
<@145305657237700608>
the lobby is still making us vote for witch game mode do we want, Random/unfair/captain etc etc
i want it strictly captain default
You need to add them every to every queue config
-d teamselection
also quick question
i can use 1 config i built and use it on the other ques
and just change the que names correct?
cuz thats what ive done
great thank you!

<@145305657237700608>
The voice channel it creates when a queue is full, will be limited to the number of people that your queue has set of teamsize, if you refeer to that
An option is to get rid off that restriction, or add an spectator role
-d mmr change
You might want static to true
-d mmr change set
show me step by step
<@648635725964902411>
its really just that one command for the MMR change
is the  bot down again?
When I try to interact with the bot, I get the message "interaction failed", and the bot commands do not appear, it is as if it does not exist on the server.
maybe try restarting your discord? Does the bot respond when you ask it

NeatQueue Hub is on node 2, shard 7
doesn't do it
i dont see any issues on my end
how can i do?
How can I restart my discord?
Close and re opening?
Are you sure you have neatqueue on your sv
what‚Äôs ur server name
could we have an option to have a map vote before the teams are picked?
had an issue in my server where the voting process just completely disappeared and it instantly skipped to making teams.

it worked completely fine earlier and it just randomly did this for some reason, don't know why
why not?
Cuase is not an option to change
the game im hosting has high pingers and the map choice greatly impacts the game because of the teams
yeah so i'm asking could it be possible to have that as an option
Ah you mean as a new feature
<#911057745204105237>
<@648635725964902411>
any updates
party system doesn‚Äôt work
if we join by vc
or is something wrong in our settings?
Yea im still aware of the issue with DM interations which effect anything happening in DMs and am working on a fix
for details: neatqueue is split across 3 physical machines (nodes) which each serve 1/3rd of the total discord servers
when you respond to an interaction in DMs, the response may not goto the same neatqueue node
so thats why sometimes DM interactions dont make sense/don't get noticed
oh okok

yes thats the command
I played a game yesterday and my ELO went to 1392
Today my ELO ticked down based on decay, even though I have a 3 day grace period set to all players.
Do I need to continually set the grace period?
I see, that's how it is. I wish it could be set up so that there was a permanent 72 hour grace period, then you started losing 10 ELO every 24 hours.
exactly yea the grace period is a 1 time thing, while decay applies everytime the time threshold passes

Can I also have a command for how to permanently not get voice channels to start when a queue is done?
Since a lot of my players are on consoles, kind of annoying.
Also skipping the "are these teams fair" question
`/readyup` and disable
`/teamselection reshuffle` disable
first one for voice channels?

it won‚Äôt delete the lobby channel (at least, i think so)

Wondering; When the teams have to vote for players but someone is gone for example (its standard 2 mins for autopick), can I change this and how?
hi i have a question, what is this???
i received and invite but i don't know from who or where did i get invited to
afaik, this is not something you can change
Ah really, fair
Would be nice but I w/e then they have to do with it
closest thing you can customize is

shall have a look at that if this changes something then!
Is there a command to set the MMR of all players to 0?

how do i make it where when a queue starts it gives them a private channel where it sends the captain voting messages & everything there

That is by default unless you disabled temp channels
`/tempchannels toggle mode:Enabled`
okay, and the player queue thingy, it doesnt show who joins for some reason, just shows no tag
any fix?

Hey, is there a way to specifically stop it so when I want to join queue in our soloq channel, that it does not bring up the option to join with an existing party?
The parties are for a premade queue seperate to that
You need to leave/delete your party
This is a shame, people are so used to just the 1 click join, we've added a premade queue and it's catching people thinking they've joined but they haven't cause they need to press the additional button for Soloq
I would have thought making parties disabled for a certain queue would be somewhat simple considering how advanced a lot of commands are
then do /partyqueue toggle
but if i do false on that
does it disable it for all queues, or a specific queue?
Configs are per queue
They do not share
ok god tier ty
thats what i wanted
i thought it was sharing my bad
I want to disable guys to join the queue if they are playing a match
For now, if they vote in the match they can go to join the queue
I want to allow only after the end of the match
`/requeue condition condition:Winner Selected`
<@648635725964902411> Hi bro, another quick question

Any idea how I can make it so a normal non server admin player role can have access to specific commands? just namely the /partycreate, /partyjoin, /partyleave etc.
Otherwise how do people even use team queues?
AI support isn't helping
/staffrole add role:Player template:User Commands Only  

Is this safe to do?
With that u set Player to a staff role that will access user commands
Well you directly just can do `/staffrole command allow`
And set the commands u want the staffrole be able to use
What do you mean?
I see, thanks
I've added player as a staff role
but it seems disabling certain normal user commands isn't possible
such as /susbtitute?
Nope, you can do that via server integrations in your server
<@648635725964902411> Is there something I am missing? This player 30 mins later after adding the role 'Player' still cant see any commands after typing / in a channel where the role is allowed to type etc.
If I try to add /party create to the allowed commands, it just says it is already possible
it should be able
just check theres not any perms overriding
Also why you denied substitute and cancel
That will just apply to that staffrole
How is this possible in team 1 that the guy with 1000 elo is losing more then the guy above?
1600 variance
<@145305657237700608>
im guessing 1000 is your starting elo? the first couple games tend to be a bit more harsh/generous to get someone to a more accurate elo faster afaik
Not really, it all comes down to this [equation](<https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3qtwvlrw8q>), my guess is that it was a bug, if it keeps happening let us know
Did it happen more than once?
*note that if you override the loser mmr, it can lead to this*
ive definitely seen situations like this where people's first few games have higher/lower elo change
Are you aware of mmr variance?
The first 10 matches also give a placements multiplier
how much
.4 * (1.2 ^ (-number of games played)) + 1 
Thats the equation
So it starts at a 1.4x multiplier, then slowly decreases down to 1x
<@648635725964902411> once a queue started, how do i end it without deleting the entire queue?
The match ends when theres a winner (voted) or the match is canceled, the queue where you click join, works as a "match generator", so you dont need to end the queue
how do i endthe match tho without people voting
-d outcome selectwinner
hm okay i see ty i will let u know if it keeps happening after  everyone got 10 games atleast
Is there a way to set Auto roles mmr with a minimum game requirement?
I dont think so
is there a way to remove auto ban completely
`/dodge autoban duration:0`
What is the command to clear the table?
To clear the leaderboard you need to reset the stats of your players
-d managestats reset
How do I give moderators in a server permissions to access queue channels and voice chats without giving them discord admin permissions
-d staffrole
how can i define the number of players that can join a position in queue?
like 2 goalkeepers, 4 defenders and 4 strikers?
when i use /roles it puts 2 for every position
yes, you can repeat roles
`/roles GK,Defender,Defender,Striker,Striker`
since its per-team
is there a way to change how long it takes for temp channels to delete themselves
What do you mean
like if we decide to drag everyone out of the temp channel for some reason, is there way to get the temp channel named Queue#xxxx to delete itself and if so how to change the time it takes to do so. instead of having to manually delete it every time
also when a game ends is there way to stop it from automatically dragging everyone back into the channel for queueing but instead into a normal vc
You cancel the match
/cancel or /outcome cancel
If you have a lobby channel set, thats where your players will be dragged back if you have it enabled
this indirectly helped i didnt know that command exists, all fixed now ty
ah, cool then <:pepeOk:1179576926613020772>

<@648635725964902411>  how to prevent ppl from changing their rattingname

Hello I‚Äôve just used the add mmr command to organise people before we actually start matchmaking but the leaderboard hasn‚Äôt changed?
what is that last msg bro üò≠ chill
Sorry bro I was tweakingüòÇüòÇüòÇ
By default, you need at least one game to show on the leaderboard
If you wanna change it
`/leaderboardconfig requiredgames`
Ahh I see, I‚Äôve done that command a bunch of times so will it be all mixed up when people play games?
I see you only are setting up some autoroles
So, did you actually change any mmr of any player?
I see you are setting the mmr of some autoroles, so people with that aurole will have that mmr, is that what you wanted?
I‚Äôve now just got a full matchmaking t
But it‚Äôs not starting anything
Like a match
if you are using the matchmaking queue type it wont instantly start
if you want to instantly start when the queue fills, change your /queuetype to PUGs
Is there a way to change the queue type without making a whole new queue?

Is there a way to reset leaderboard
With one command
I have mmr based 1vs1 Que everyone starts at 1100 and works way up or down. 

I have roles for 
1300+
1299-1000
999~

How do I make it so people in higher MMRs aren‚Äôt able to play the lower level people?
And is it possible some roles play with each other while others don‚Äôt?

Examples,
I want my 999- mmr people to only play with themselves, I want my 1000+ and 1300-1400 people to be able to play with each other
Lastly, if I get this set up and I have 1350 mmr personal join the Que, does that lock the Que until they find a match? Or can 900 mmr people join and fight their level people?
Please help ü•≤
You have to reset the stats
-d managestats reset
If you really wanna avoid then youll need more queues
And apply a role requirement
For which part? To make high mmr people not play with low mmr people? Or to make it so certain roles can play with each other
Make roles dont play vs eachother
<@648635725964902411> can you help me
How tu use
<@648635725964902411>
How to use like this sit
<@648635725964902411>
Stop pinging
Just click join queue, if it asks you to join a voice channel, join
Then some votement will appear
You have video
So how do I prevent my high mmr players from playing low mmr players if I have roles based on mmr score already
<@648635725964902411>

I‚Äôm trying to create a sort of ranked system for my 8s community, using the bot. What sort of cool commands would you guys recommend? Just stuff to make it more immersive and fun
Theres a basic guide
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
You have role based on mmr, not queues based on roles
You would have to get a new queue
And only allow the roles you want to queue
-d rolerequirement
So if I have 8 different roles based on mmr, then I need 8 different 1vs1 ques?
If you want that rank system yeah, or other way would be trying matchmaking queue, and play with the range and leniency
I came across an issue, so basically sometimes i notice the bot decides to give the roles for players that are currently playing (autorole ingame) but sometimes he refuses to give it to others
any way to fix it
tried pretty much everything but doesnt seem to be solved
How do I get captains to pick one player at a time?
<@648635725964902411>
if i have rank system and i want players getting elo depending on what rank they are how do i do that? ex: silver rank gains 25+ and losses 10+ and gold gains 20+ and losses 15
how do I edit how much people gain and lose per win and loss
Have you read the guide i have sent twice?
Thats by default unless you have changed it
`/captains drafttype`
Theres not really a way to customize that
You could try a workaround with mmr multipliers
-d mmr multiplier
<@145305657237700608> can you add in the webhook the channel id where actions come from like where match created and show the id channel of that and teams created i want to do an automation with that
i thought it‚Äôs already included, is it not
no in my webhook doesnt appear the correctly one
when it listen shows other channel id number
you know when this bot creates a channel i want that channel id so i can do something i want with that
Could I do these 8 different ques but have them share the same leaderboard?

What are u trying to do
Hello,
Would like to see if anyone could help me out. I have one queue setup in my server but when I try to do the second queue it says im only allowed three. Not understanding why I can't make the other queue if I only have 1
check your /serverstats info, itll show your queues
The permissions are on
Im not sure what im doing wrong
Nevermind
I figured that part out but it looks like the other two are in channels that I had deleted
wont let me access it at all
any idea on what I can do?
or how to remove the queue from the deleted channels?
can you make your own drafttype picks?
I put that it is necessary to have a role to join the queue, but when I test it, I can join it without this role.
Do you rememeber the name of the queues?
Nope
`/rolerequirement remove`
Remove @ everyone from the rolerequirement
thank u so much!!
I keep setting mmr to 50 but it defaults to 66. also, when people play more games they seem to have a higher elo win/lose threshold (not even centered around 66 as time goes on)‚Ä¶i disabled multipliers too and idk why this is happening
example
Do you have more queues?
yes i have 3 i see the mmr settings to the same on each one
set^
What do you see on /info page 3
The mmr u showed me was from Fighter 1v1
There‚Äôs an issue in all 3 but i‚Äôll send fighter too
yeahmm thats weird
could you send me the config of any of those
it started working all of a sudden üò≠

how to add new leaderboard for another type of game with defult MMR , because I already have leaderboard ?
You need a new queue
And then run the leaderboard command for that new queue
How to create a queue for 8 people (3 field players and 2 goalkeepers), so that after the required number of players, a text channel is created, where 2 captains (the best players in the queue by ELO) choose a team, then vote for the winner? And how to make a leaderboard?
If necessary, I can provide rights on my server for you to do.
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
For the roles part
-d roles
please tell me all the commands)
I read it, but I didn't really understand it all.

What u dont understand
so that after the required number of players, a text channel is created, where 2 captains (the best players in the queue by ELO) choose a team, then vote for the winner? And how to make a leaderboard?
Its on the guide i sent you tho. /teamselection needs to be captains, you can then choose /captains selection
And /leaderboard
how to create text channel?
There is no choice of teams
<@648635725964902411>
<@648635725964902411>  Can you please tell me what comands to do like this: 2 teams (4 people each), that is 8 to start the game, after which a channel is created where the captains assemble a team for themselves, where the 2 best players in the queue assemble a team for themselves (among those in the queue), the first picks the top 2 by ELO, the top 1 accordingly the second (1-2-1 selection system), there is also voting for the winner. And also, I will have a separate channel where the leaderboard will be seen and watched.

P.S. roles, 6 field players and 2 goalkeepers
i can do that come dms
can i make only two queues sharing same leadeboard just this two queues just one queue would have different roles to entry and another one other roles

How do i turn off the option when it asks if teams are fair?
-d teams reshuffle
is it possible to make this bot create new roles for each team?
or well assign it
also could i make it create teams of for example 3v3v3v3v3... for all members with a certain roles if there is around 50??
does this bot sell a custom version?
<@145305657237700608> do you offer custom branding?
I think there's an issue with the mmr in my server, and I can't figure it out.

The first image is the current leaderboard. It shows first place with 631. Second image shows the peak mmr, but they're at 576, which is lower.

There's been a few instances as well where some people appear to lose or gain elo from nowhere. At least, nowhere I can track it, and nobody is using /add mmr or something like that when I look at the logs.

Any ideas on what could be going on?
Another example I meant to post is this one. It's Lovo (in the yellow box) ending the night with 537 mmr, but both the leaderboard and /stats shows he has 462. So mmr is either not being applied, or something is wonky. Not for sure which.
yea this is definitely looking strange, it shouldnt be possible for the peak to be less than the mmr
Any idea on how I could fix it or anything?
its manually fixable but i wanna fix the cause
were these matches manually modified?
How do I get the map vote?
I want only captains to be voted on and not maps within the queue channel.
Looks like it. It has the same results as the previous image
Hello everyone! I need some help. There are three queues running on the server through a bot. In all three queues, the leaderboard, rating display in match results, and the leaderboard itself are working completely fine. However, for some reason, the MMR after players' nicknames has suddenly stopped changing and is always equal to 1000. What could be the problem? <@145305657237700608>
apparently the peak MMR is not updated when manually updating the match results
so thats something i need to fix
Is this the same for the Stats card when you run /stats?
the stats shown in /stats would reflect their most up to date stats
so something is likely still up
No, it's right. I just confused myself.

Thanks!
All votement and setuo happens within the queue channel, i dont know what you mean by "How do i get the map vote", then you say you dont want maps to be voted, you wanna disable it?
Hi Im a member of select 11s that is having the issue and yes something is still up the stats show my true mmr that is 537 but the MMR isn‚Äôt updated at the top and shows 462.
I just went back and found all of his queues to double check. For some reason, 75.5 mmr just disappears overnight. The last one is the latest queue that was started up.
<@145305657237700608>Hey could we go dms? have to talk about the subscription of the bot
Hello again everyone! Why doesn't the bot give MMR numbers after nicknames? The message from the documentation is entered correctly, but for some reason it says that 0 participants have been renamed, the bot has rights on the server. What could be the problem?
Webhooks are not working how it should be , not getting the correct information ID of users fix it please
Also not the right channels id
please check it <@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>
oh its probably javascript and big numbers
numbers are too big for it
But why sizes is not the issue just we get other numbers that are not the correct ones
Can you really fix it with this issue we can‚Äôt do what we want to do
for now you would have to use a parser which supports numbers this large
i can update it to use strings instead of numbers though
Two queues one for winners and losers and just the captain party leader give them a role based on match completed if they win or not and get access to one queue channel or the other one
But I need that right ID users
I don‚Äôt care too much about the channels just the user
yes i understand
see the issue is not how big it fits the numbers just there are different numbers specially the last digits are the ones different <@145305657237700608>
i assure you its the numbers being too large
Already happened ^
yea the webhooks need to function the same
I don‚Äôt understand the parser how I do it and what you mean you can update with strings instead of numbers that way can it work?
I will investigate what it means parser but try too see a way around so we can get the right id user in the webhook
i can update it soon in any case
Nicee im working for now to set it up the two queues one for winners and losers just we want to make this process smoother with the Match completed action but I need to have that id otherwise this won‚Äôt work haha
When you think you will update it so I can get back to working on that ?
Btw <@145305657237700608> , is the same issue happening with the channel IDs too? Because the difference is quite big. Try to fix it if you can. In my opinion, that‚Äôs a separate issue‚Äîthe actions that take place in the created channels (like ‚Äòmatch started‚Äô and ‚Äòteams created‚Äô) should be linked to their actual channels. However, the webhook is showing a completely different channel ID, which doesn‚Äôt even match the real one.
is it a valid channel
its probably the same issue
not even a valid channel
the channel id from the webhook
this is from the webhook information the channel id where action took place as you can see is not the right one more difference of numbers to be same issue i reckon but you know more so it might be the same one idk <@145305657237700608>
yea sounds like the same issue
When will you update it ?
<@145305657237700608> ?
i can look now but not sure when i will update
probably tomorrow
how can i make the drafttype to be like 1-1-1-1-1-2-1
Theres no way to make custom drafttypes
how can i make people who are higher mmr lose more than the original amount
in simple terms.
by default players who are higher than the lobby average will gain less and lose more
-d mmr change variance
the docs have a calculator for customizing how drastic it is
should i have this on
i just enabled it
That just means your players can vote to disable the mmr in that specific match
<a:minionlaughslow:1281046174920343646>
ok hold up
also what is the docs
lmfao that emoji
https://docs.neatqueue.com/#/
omg thank you
so kind guys
All right thank you so much I‚Äôm excited for the update just let me know when is ready tomorrow I want to finish this set up by weekend
how do i setup so when i put 1v1 it makes a 1v1 queue
Just wondering if there was an update on the missing mmr situation
-d setup
sorry no clear answer yet :/
Thanks! I appreciate your hard work
Ok it should be good now if you can test
All numbers larger than 2 ^ 53 - 1 will be converted to strings in API and webhook responses

Search "rate limit" in the server
>>> Due to Discord API limitations, NeatQueue can only update the channel name twice per a 10 minute period. If you are experiencing issues with creating channels, it may be due to hitting the rate limit. You can try again later or check if the issue persists. If you continue to have trouble creating channels, please reach out in the <#868549627652214794> channel for further assistance.
i don‚Äôt get it
If you search "rate limit" here, you'll come across something similar to what I sent. It's probably making too many channels at once
it usually goes away after not too long
I need someone who is an expert on this, I will pay
this system feels amazing but I am not able to use its full potential

Please help

we have 3 que on the server, but 2 working bad bcs them grab info from 3 que
<@145305657237700608>
Yeah is good now gives me the right ID user and channel thanks
Btw <@145305657237700608> can you make a auto role for party captains cuz we want only them to have access to some commands we have a manager role so we just want that role to be automatically giving to party captains

<@145305657237700608> We have solved the problem that Houdini talked about. But now when creating a lobby where people gather in a voice chat (captains choose players, ban maps). In this temporary voice channel and in subsequent channels (head channels of two teams), user restrictions have disappeared. During picks and bans, anyone can enter, there is no limit of 10 people. And there is also no limit of 5 users in teams.
<@145305657237700608> please help ^^^
did you add a spectator role?
or staff role
How do I disable map voting?
I expressed myself badly before, sorry
like remove the maps entirely? or just automatically pick a map?
remove it completely
-d map remove
tnks
whats the easiest way to prevent players from being in multiple queues
At once?
-d requeue condition
can i set a limit of how many games a queue can have at the same time?
Nope
You can manually lock the queue tho
<@145305657237700608> can you add a autorole for party captains leaders when they are captains or leaders
<@145305657237700608> also can you add in the webhook the voice channels that had been made for teams that channel ids so I can change that way biltrate to maximum supported for our level 3 server
Hey the bot ran out of time I guess and automatically entered who won last night how do I stop it from doing that? So it‚Äôs just vote who won only
that wouldnt really solve it, theres a `match cleanup` limit
-d timer matchcleanup
the bot keeps randomly deciding wins for us 5 mins after the match has started event hough I have that ^ set to over an hour
<@145305657237700608>
Are u in test mode?
Send the config of your queue
`/config save`
I saved it how do I send in here
typed in test mode and it said enabled so id imagine it wasnt in it to begin with
you can just share the config code
idk how lol
when you do /config save it gives a code
just let us know what it is

Is it possible to have a mixture of a role and team queue together. What I mean by this‚Ä¶. 2 teams in a queue, where roles would need to be selected. The roles queue as seen on this site, prompt you to choose a role when joining. I want to be able to setup a queue with 2 teams, have roles needed to be chosen but only one role per team and up to 11 roles per team. Then if someone leaves the queue, that role is selectable by the person who joins again
like this? <#915812742865231912>
Oh wow ye‚Ä¶ I would look to do this for up to 11 roles per team‚Ä¶ my terminology would be positions but in this context roles, as we would have two football teams. So hopefully this will work how I‚Äôm thinking, seems to from what you did. Thanks for the quick response.  Is there a way of having unranked casual and ranked and it track what role they were playing?
No theres no tracking/stats for specific roles
Ok‚Ä¶ is there anyway to stop them choosing a role on a different team unless they have left the role on the existing team Example. If I click team 1 role x and then click team 2 role y, I am in both teams and from a game perspective that isn‚Äôt possible and I would be blocking a space in the other team.
thats only possible in test mode
by default players can only be in queue once
Am I able to use test mode? So in theory, use. Test mode/role/team queue?
yes /test
Cool.üòé thanks.
Actually, it is test mode that allows you to jump into different queues. So by default. It should do what I am asking. That‚Äôs even better
Assuming the one here is in test?
yes, you wont want test mode
What would be the command to setup the role/team queue combination?
you can use /setup
for the queue type use "Select Team On Join"
will give this a test, thanks.. is there a way to handle min and max participants (outside of the part feature). example in the scenario above, we have team select on join, and we define each team to have 11 players each. We would then have to wait for 11 on each to join before it starts, or is there a way to setup if it gets to 8 per team it can or if it goes to the vote of the players to decide if they wanted to start whilst waiting for others to join the queue.
Hey <@145305657237700608> did you see my previous messages about adding an autorole for party leaders as well as captains would be great and add in the webhook also voice channels ids created so i can change those the biltrate automatically the of them with an automation
-d forcestartconfig conditions
that is great, thank you. is it possible to allow the players to vote to start if over min_size? i believe it is, example "Players can force start with 20 players" the scenario i am trying to get around for 11 v 11 with predifened roles, is the majority of times, we wont have a GK join, but there will be times when they will. This could hold up the queue starting as 10v10 for all those roles (except gk) would be fine, but then if someone did choose GK and there was a different role still to be chosen, the game would automatically be forced to start. Alternatively, if i set the queue to 10v10 then gk roles could miss out playing in the queue. i hope that is clear. thanks
You can run, /forcestart
how to make the channles that are made when game starts unlocked
-d channel restriction
how do I stop people automatically being moved into the team voice channels without removing the voice channels?
when we select winning team it pulls us all back into the voice channel used for queueing how do i get it to drag everyone into a normal vc when the game ends instead
in this scenario, where we have 2 teams of 11 players and the queue type is set to select team on join. (players are chosing their role (role = position in this scenario). Is there anyway to not have a captain, so it doesnt influence changing of this roles/positions on the team.  Is a captain mandotory for games to start? i want to be able to have players chose the position, team, the match start and then they auto requeue until they choose to leave the lobby.
How do I put this rating on the server? <@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>

Dude this work for you to be able to take a look? <@145305657237700608>
I feel like I‚Äôm ignored by NeatZü•∫üò≠
looking
sorry, just get alot of messages and miss things
plz post any feature requests in <#911057745204105237> , easier to see
Just I want an autorole for party leaders also captains and in the webhook information when teams are created include the voice channel ids created by NeatQueue so that way I can change automatically with an automation the audio biltrate
And I also with those voice channels ids I can change the name of those voice channels with their captains name I know is a command for that but I want to keep Team A and Team B I just want to edit that automatically
when we select winning team it pulls us all back into the voice channel used for queueing how do i get it to drag everyone into a normal vc when the game ends instead
any luck lol. dont wanna run the lobby again until I get it resolved cause its just cutting our games off mid match
for me the match didn't auto resolve for a long time
the only thing i see is it only needs 3 votes
Yeah I put it to that on purpose. Ill try it again and see if its maybe fixed now
is there a way to set it so only admins can vote?
-d message winnermessage results
cool thanks
trying to set up a call of duty thing. we want 6 lobbies occurring at the same time playing their own games, how do i set up multiple VCs that all have the same settings
You have your queue, you configure your queue, the queue is like a "match creator", everytime the size its meet, it will start a new game, and so on, channels will be created automatically
when we select winning team it pulls us all back into the voice channel used for queueing how do i get it to drag everyone into a normal vc when the game ends instead ( please help )
<@145305657237700608> that‚Äôs something I also want the vc created from the queue when it finishes just move everyone to a general chat voice , I don‚Äôt like that when it finished the game all the users have to manually go to general chat and a lot of people just leave and don‚Äôt join back after every game is annoying
Also please see this
-d lobbychannel set
also how do i get premium for more than 3 queues
<@145305657237700608> also I was noticing people that are with team A can join Team B voice channel and we don‚Äôt want that how I can make sure just people team A can join to Team A voice channel
did you add a spectator role or change permissions? by default created channels only allow the team to join
<@857633321064595466> premium

how do i end queues after deleting the queue channels?
Everyones elo got reseted when joining a queue, if i revert that match does it come back?
<@145305657237700608>
stats dont reset unless you do it manually
did you change any of these
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
Yes i put /leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide true
but their elo&stats got reseted
The stats are shared serverwide but one queue has different stats than the other
thats not really possible, its either serverwide or not
might be a bug then, cuz player x has different stats on queue 1 and queue 2 and sharedstats serverwide is turned on
How do i make the players go back to their past stat?
could it be because of this?
Anybody know why this just keeps looping forever
not exactly sure, but i think its a vote for each player
you got to click no instead
anybody know how to make this game per game basis and not per set
What do you mean exactly?
When you vote, it's the winner of an entire set. I want the vote to be per map mode instead of the entire set
-d bestof
It's already bo5
Whenever we choose which team won said match it just closes the room
when I thought it would say 1-0
You should only vote after the entire match
its results for the match, not per map
Ahhh okay, I was hoping there would be a "report score" after every round.
Would that be possible in the future if I suggest it?

Not asking if it's guaranteed, but if it's possible in the first place. Wouldn't want to suggest something that is not possible.
how do we get the premium role, been 3 months
This button should have a button of confirmation when you press them to confirm that you want to change the result
By accident one of the admins cancel one game
Just please add a button of confirmation or something <@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411>
Im not on the development
Also, you can just click the button of the team that won again
That‚Äôs not the issue sometimes the game is running and we cancel it by accident we don‚Äôt want also to appear that just after the game is finish
i don‚Äôt see any benefit really since it wouldn‚Äôt add any value besides showing up in the match result
smart idea
are you the one who purchased the credits?
Is there any more documentation on how the different captain picking orders work? (1-1-1-1-1 e.t.c.)
We're drafting captains for a game called Deadlock which is played 6v6, and we're struggling alot with captain balance.
The current setup is that we vote for captains. When two captains are selected, the first one drafts one player. Then, if that drafted first player has high enough mmr, the second captains gets 2 picks (if he drafts the first player under a threshold mmr). This feature is not documented anywhere and doesnt seem to be configurable. 
Also, sometimes the first player gets to draft 2 players back to back, and the reason for that seems to be very random.
Is it possible to make a configurable setting for captain drafting, and not just the standard modes that are available? None of them seem balanced and the one we got now is the most "balanced" we can do for 6v6
For example, make it configurable so that we can choose 2-2-2-2-2-2 or something like that
Yeah, its not configurable
-d drafttype
Only those are available
hello everyone, how can i reset the entire setup of neatqueue that i have done and just start from scratch without the previous setup mixing in with the new?
-d endqueue
-d managestats reset
i had trouble setting up my first queues in my server, i only have one set up and when i try to make the second it says i can only have 3 queues??
how do you disable this, I want them to be random and balanced. But I don't want them to select which, it should always be randomized/balance
You have to choose, either balanced or random, by /teamselection
is there any way to change the text inside this embed here
-d language overrides
Am i able to reset all language overrides i did?
why does the bot assign that some players have [25] at the start of their names?
even thought thats not their elo
are we able to add more than 25 heroes to ban from now? my game has like 27 xd
does neatqueue support counter picks
Hi! 

Anyone know why /dodge mmrpenalty does not work? I want someone who joins a queue but then does not ready up in time gets an automatic -30 mmr reduction. When I do the command in the queue channel it says it‚Äôs applied but no one loses points for dodging. Is this feature broken?
whats the limit of monthly players on the free version , and also does monthly players mean the amount of players who can be on the leaderboard
It works for me
Do u get the dm that tells you lost mmr ?
https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/910981294937210930/1231732110629277800
ok ty, also with the free version how many autoroles for leaderboard position can i use or is it unlimited
<@648635725964902411> Nope! No pms from the bot
I just joined, purposefully dodged, and I lost no MMR and no PM
I feel there must be another config im missing but idk what
Unkimit
Send me the config
-d cnfi save
4v4 soloq
try that?
unsure if that's a valid name
Yeah its valis
Valid
The issue is that it seems that the command only works if there is a `/dodge autoban` (*i didnt know this or if you can avoid it*).
The current solution is giving a `/dodge autoban`, you can do just 1 second autoban and it works
ahhh i see
thanks so much! i'll put it to 1 second and see what happens
Ok, this works, but really weird bug now. I put -30mmr and the bot is pming me 

But I'm actually GAINING 30 mmr on the leaderboards each time
oh nvm, its deduct, and putting -30 would mean its +30 lul
from the website? nope, since we don‚Äôt have the payment method on there(
btw is there banning maps feature?
-d map bans
how about pick feature?
such as in best of 3 matches
2 maps banned 2 maps picked then 2 maps banned
Tried to ask in the ai support but was not getting anywhere.

I have two roles setup that I want to be pinged.
I want the "4 ppl in queue" role to be pinged when the queue hits four. And I want the "7 ppl in queue" role to be oinged when the queue hits 7.

Whenever I try to add a second auto ping, it always deletes/overrides the first one. I want two, how do i do that
currently you can only set one
shucks, okay
Can someone help me change the maximum number of players?
GK 0/2 and Util 0/20
<@648635725964902411> Hi, is there any bo3 veto options with this bot? Eg each team bans 1 map, then picks 2 and the bans 2 more to get the decider map if needed.
unfortunately it always goes bans -> picks
it doesn‚Äôt go back and forth
you can specify roles multiple times in /roles
Ahh sad, would be super cool if u could implement that, bot is already solid
how can I make it so only people in a specific voice channel can press the queue button?
so basically it doesn't let ppl queue who aren't in that voice channel
<@145305657237700608> is there an option for this?
Is there a command to show the list of active auto roles based on mmr?
thank you
-d info
That is not possible
Closest thing is making a voice channel to just join the queue
what if make a role only for that vc channcel and let only few people have it
<@648635725964902411> If a person is in 1 queue and the match hasn't been scored yet, they cannot join aother queue. is there a way to fix it
or if there's a way to let the channels not get deleted after the game has been scored
-d requeue condition
for how tournaments work, can you setup the signup for the tournament to allow people to signup by position and then have the bot split them up into even teams?
is there a way to have neat que automatically give/remove a role to whoevers #1 on the leaderboard?
try /autoroles leaderboardposition set
unfortunately not, tournament signups are for full teams
ok no worries. this is the error i got when i tried to sign up my team
I set team size to 6 and a max of 6 teams total
what does the party look like
make sure the /teamsize is actually 6
you can check /info or reuse the command
Anyone else having issues with the tournament working?
is it just your party, or all parties?
all parties
whats the channel ID?
1353755620146417694
I can try and help you
i have had multiple issues with tournament feature and problaly know some fixes
Have you gotten it functioning and running now?
I run multiple tournaments
Daily
i can take a look after work, from what you described you should be fine but seems something is up
Can you run the info command and send me a ss of the settings you have it set to please when you have a moment?
That would be greatly appreciated! My community loves the app and I‚Äôve shared it with another community as well
I made a role banned from being a captain. How can I revert this?
thanks for the help <@239327215651651596> !
how do you get the join and leave selection bit?
this
did you figure it out?
im about to take a look
yeah, i was screwing it up
it auto posts it when you create the tournament
Anything i need to fix on my end? or we all good there
only thing that happened after i got my teams in and force started the tournament was it gave me a "something went wrong error its been noted" and the signup disappeared along with the link. is there a command or another way for me to find the link without having to go to challonge?
the link should be in the queue title
Ok so you have to make a tournament
Just trying to set it up for 8s on cod
if you want a tournament, yes
if you just want a normal queue, use /setup
when i put set up i get nothing
make sure the bot has perms to send messages
how do i use the leaderboard
this what happens when used it
If u have more than one queue you will have to link that channel to the desired queue u want to display the stats from
With /link as it says there
thank you
the endpoint api/transcript/server_id/game_num dont work?
it should work
yea it does
for me allways return null
https://www.neatqueue.com/transcript/505102060119916545/2161 here‚Äôs an example
make sure you set a staffchannel
-d staffchannel
otherwise it won‚Äôt generate transcripts
aaaa ty
Where I can get that ?
I only use webhooks
But what‚Äôs that website to do endpoints
https://api.neatqueue.com/docs
What another amazing things I can do with that
Like I only do automations with the webhooks
me too
i only use the docs for tests
All right you use n8n or something?
N8n easy to use and cheap to host haha unlimited automation
i programmed a api in python for the automation
Oh so yeah you are more advanced than me
<:sadcat:1179569615911800842>
for what game are you using it?
Is possible to join someone in queue from a website or from other server having my bot and they connect the credentials of discord so would be the same or not?
EA FC
11vs11
Like can I create a bot that can be in other servers friends servers and by using a command or button join queue or left
check for the endpoint api/v2/player/add with it you can do that
Really that would be amazing
But they need to be in discord in my server in order to work or not?
i think it not necessary
yea they need to be in the server still
you could do a ton with the API, every command can be used through the API
Yeah will take me a lot time to do it is not any website or something friendly for people who are new to this I‚Äôm using n8n is easier for webhooks but I don‚Äôt know if I can do api there‚Äôs
<@145305657237700608>  what can i do if lately the TEAMS_CREATED webhook fails to send, because when this happens the data is not sent to the server and i have to restart the whole match.

Players that are "afk" whilst queued up, receive this direct message from NeatQueue (the one in image is from a time I did not respond, to show the blue button) , when they click the "Im Here!" button, the button disappears but the player is still kicked 5 minutes later.

The command "/timer afk true timer [time]" is set, yet players are still being kicked? The "im here" button should stop the players from being kicked no?

The 6 minutes of inactivity image, is when i was testin the afk timer with 6 minutes. I recieved a dm saying i would be removed in 5 minutes due to inactivity, and asked me to click the button. I clicked it, and then I was kicked anyway...

Hi there, every time I try to start a queue it says neatqueue is not responding.. any idea why? It was working all day yesterday
it‚Äôs prolly down rn just wait
i kinda messed up setting the bot up in my server by adding in game roles, when i didint desire to do that. how do i change it to open
To change where match results are displayed after a match ends, you can adjust the settings for the specific queue channel. You can do this by using the /lobbychannel command to set the lobby channel where match results will be displayed. Additionally, you can check the /teamselection command to ensure that match details are being sent to the correct channel. If you continue to have issues with match results appearing in the wrong channel, I recommend reaching out to the ‚Å†‚îÇsupport channel for further assistance.

<@145305657237700608> match started action webhook sending too late
Can you check and fix it
Other actions are working correctly join queue, leave queue ,teams created , match ended but the one is taking too much time to be sent to webhook is the match started
i believe thats the first thing thats done when a match starts
Yeah and is not being sent until almost 14 minutes after or more
Other actions are working fine
Can you check
Maybe do a refresh or quick restart
Every other webhook actions is sending straight away but this match started more than 15 minutes later is sent to where I control my webhooks responses
<@145305657237700608> check please there is something wrong with the webhooks
i just tested it myself and instantly got the webhook when the match started

Hello, how  to make rank system like if some guy reaches a particuuuular amount of ELO, he she would get a Rank suppose Coal Rank
If i have an staff results channel, can i make it so players choose the winners themselves? whats the command for that
"/autoroles"
that‚Äôs the default
-d message winnermessage results
players vote, can‚Äôt use the staff channel
So if players choose who won, i cant go back and change it?
you can always modify match results
Alright thanks
Hello
Is there anyone that could help with the bot?
what is the upper raiting ?
max mmr
okay ty I have an extra thing
How can I prevent someone from queueing in two chanels ?
I mean I'm in rank A and I queued 6mans and 4mans in the same time is it supposed to be disable ?
why do i keep getting this and not a join leave pop up
fixed it dont worry
I dont think this is avoidable
However, when the match in one of those starts the player will be pulled out
oh good
the bot will force the leave for him ?
It will start the match, and it automatically leaves the another queue
nice
how to make the bot delete the winner message in the queue channel after 1m for example ? (:
or if another queue played after it the message was before automaticlly deleted
You can make an another channel and have it dedicated as the results channel
The bot will only post results in that channel
It‚Äôs /results channel
yeah I know this, I mean an another message the sents to the same queue channel it says rematch and vote for mvp
anyone know how to change the leaderboard name? / setleaderboardname command isn't popping up
is there a way to stop the bot from creating vc channels (my gamemodes is 1v1v1v1) so it just floods the side
/voicechannels command with the teamchannels and /lobbychannel options toggled off. This will prevent the bot from automatically creating voice channels once the set up is complete.
Leaderboard name will always be the queue name, or if you have server wide stats you can set a custom name but, this only works for that. Also that command doesnt exist
Theres not a way to do that, but you can set it so the message gets edited and only the last winner message is shown on the results channel
-d message queuemessage edits
<@648635725964902411> Hi sir, AI is not helping sadly.

For this config: 4vs4 Queue

I want to see the mmr change amount, I cannot remember if I put it to 50 (Default) or to 25 or something like that. I find it weird I can't just type /config info and see all the stuff, am I missing a command?
Its actually, just /info
ahah
how do you enable server wide stats, and what command after that allows you to change the name? i thought i enabled server wide stats, but then once i try to change the name is says i need to disable server wide stats
-d leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide
usually if you have serverwide stats enabled you dont need to change the name
so i enabled server wide stats and it says stats will be shared using the name i created, when i try to create the leaderboard (in a separate channel) it says no queue found. what am i missing? sorry lol i cant figure out for some reason and its the last thing i need
is there a way to easily do a soft elo reset?
I found a way, but I have another question now, usually how long does it take for the bot to update autoroles? I have around 630 players with 8 different autoroles in my server and I changed them all at pretty much once üòÖ
It seems to be doing work slowly but surely
its still updating players
like 5-8 per minute
is there a way to make it a bit faster somehow?
not really, updating the roles for many users will be slow due to discord rate limits
aaah üòµ‚Äçüí´ thank you for this info tho
I have a problem I set a role to a certain mmr when I give someone the role his mmr dosen't change, and some of them change how is that xD
What do you mean?
startingmmr set?
Im a bit confused on the /autoroles copy command, could someone clarify it a bit for me please
My leaderboard keeps switching to the wrong data/queue name
is there any videos or anyone to help me set up neat queue for cdl 8s and hardpoint 8s for my cord ?
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
Error Code:WLKAQ  Any help?
looks like an error on my side, will fix
it tried removing MMR from a player without any MMR (due to being queue banned)
thank you. also, players voted for wrong team during voting process, anyway to undo that? i cant figure it out
nvm im blind i got it
hi, how do i reset leaderboard?
Hey
Is it possible for all the players to be moved into specific channel after the game ends?
For example 2 teams 5 people each gets moved to lobby (Return to previous channel doesn't cut it if someone joined queue from different channel)
-d lobbychannel set
-d managestats reset
Oh thanks
Is there any way to do endorsements (like in OW) in which you can thumbs up or down people? I know there is MVP to add MMR but is there any other to vote?
or like add a link to the match results
Asking here because I find anything in the documentation, but is there a way to reset the leaderboard completely without having it rollover to a new month? Say I want the leaderboard to reset every 3 months, is there any way I can force a reset (including mmr, wins, losses, etc) using a command?
MVPs are the only thing unfortunately
-d managestats reset all
cheers
Hi i set up neatqueue to have selectable roles from overwatch while queueing, but this made the bot stop showing who is queueing, how do i reenable this?
and also how do i make it show who is queued for each role
Can some one give me the other equations that the bot uses other than this one?
Hey <@145305657237700608> I need help
mmr we set for the main leaderboard is different from the mmr set for the monthly lb. how do I change the mmr for monthly lb
look this
also how do i separate the monthly lb from the all time lb
our leaderboards stopped displaying for the majority of my users. anyway to fix this?
it only shows these random 4 users, they have no special roles or perms just normal users
make sure you have /anonymousqueue disabled
sorry i‚Äôm not fully understanding your setup, lets open a thread
Leaderboard issue
looks like a new month, it won‚Äôt show other players until they play
I have personally played 5 games and am not showing
our games require 12 people to start because our game is 6v6, so I should have at least 12 people on the list. thanks in advance for the help
Would be cool to have this reset leaderboard more options not just monthly like every 6 weeks or 2 or 3 months
<@145305657237700608> this is new option for me I want my queue to be reset every month for now cuz there is no options for more time
What‚Äôs the command
And what does it mean roll and reset?
is it possible for me to have this into another channel?
everytime it ends
I have a weird problem. I added NQ about 11-12 days ago. During the setup process the bot kept freezing, forcing me to restart the setup process each time and hope it finishes. This caused all sorts of chaos with linking and causing new queues, to the point where I just removed the bot, hoping it'll reset it so I can just start fresh. Now though, I can't run setup, cant make any queues, as it still thinks there are running queues in channels that don't exist anymore. How do I clear the bot's data/reset it so I can just start fresh? I tried /serverstats info to see if there are missing Qs, but it just throws `unexpected error` each time, stuck in a loop here.
<@145305657237700608> could you tell me how are the rewards in the blue boxes calculated by default? 

And is there a way I can make that they all get the same reward?

yes i‚Äôm taking a look
Great, thanks for the hard work
took a bit to track down but it should be up in a few minutes
It's working now, thanks
Works thank you
The mmr variance give me only 1 value but how are the mmrs different for each person?
Do the mmr rewards depend on the winstreak and the persons mmr? And how? 

Or only the average teams mmr?
Wdym
Thats calculated with mmr variance, the mmr for each person
The opponents mmr, you can set some winstreak multiplier, and for first games, theres a small boost
But look at this for example
They are not getting 25.2
They're getting slightly more
How is this happening?
Because the team that won has less mmr than their opponents
Hello image dont show
Hm i don't understand
 can you give me an example on one of the players that were in my ss?
if the team you beat has a higher MMR, then you will gain more MMR than average since it was a harder matchup
Hi, the bot is down on my server
<@648635725964902411> any way to communicate neatz the bot is off?

Hey - just some more info - also down in one of my servers, but functional in another.
Gotta wait neatz
because bot has 3 nodes
node 2 its off
you probably have 1 server on node 2
yes i figured as much. Just saying that it is only one node thats down
2 days ago happened the same with the node 2
not again

Hello how can I change the staff channel logs?
it keeps posting it in the wrong channel i tried /staff channel
command
doesnt work
How's it calculated?
The mmr variant thing only calculates the average mmr that they get
But doesn't calculate how much mmr does each player get
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> help!

Thank you!
how do i reset leaderboard but dont want it to reset monthly? just want a reset <@648635725964902411>
-d manage stats reset
by doing this action can you still go back in taps to see previous leaderboard?
so what's the best option if you are starting a new season but still want people to see the old stats? because season last a bit longer than a month so /confiq montly is not the best option
well i really havent tried, i dont know if you reset the stats it will reset for all the months, but i guess it likely wil
so i do not think there is a solution for your problem
okay, thanks
<@145305657237700608> <@648635725964902411> when using the command ‚Äú/queuename name‚Äù it brings up a list of names, including inactive or old names. Is there a way to delete theses old or inactive queue names from the database?
yes if you wipe stats for those names then they won‚Äôt appear

make sure you type the queue name

Hello i have a problem
oui wallah
üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ
Just ask
bot is break .
looking
thanks
looks like its back
yep, this error has gone away
team balancing according to mmr is totally broken
<@648635725964902411> ??
wdym broken
need more info than that
The people with the most mmr are together and the people with the least MMR are together - the teams are not very evenly distributed.
do you have any screenshots?
which also show how teams were selected
is it too much to ask of someone to help me set up queues system in my discord? I feel like i managed to set up the basic one, but i wonder if i could set up a better one where people will be then moved to channels after the queue is complete? I don't know how to set these
I'm experiencing problems with a filled queue, not making making a match.
Is there some sort of overload?
Because matchmaking queue searchs for people with similar mmr to start a match, so it wont start until it finds the players within a range
You can change the queue type to pugs
-d queuetype
ask in AI channel, it helped me
it actually helped, thanks a lot
is there a limit to amount of games played?

hey i have a question
how do i make it so that the voting system is captain by default
Hey! I just wanted to know how to increase the size of the team when joining the queue
I would like the circled role to have 4 instead of 2
<@648635725964902411>
-d teamselection
-d roles
I had a question, whenever I make a map set it doens't save for anything and the maps/modes don't show up <@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608>
are you ending the queue?
Is it possible to manually change captains after they've been selected within the context of a match?

The flow would be:
1) No parties have been created.
2) Players join queue.
3) Match is created
4) Players vote for captain using the Voting option
5) Chosen captain does not want to be captain. We need to switch that person with someone else

I know that the /party captain command exists, but since we don't have parties to begin with, I don't think that applies in this scenario
No I try to add the maps and modes and when the mapset gets updates I try to update it but it says there‚Äôs nothing
Is not possible, but there should be the possibility of shuffling again the captain, did u disable that option?
I tested with reshuffling enabled, but I don't see any option that allows it. In my scenario, players vote for a captain, that vote passes / completes, and captains are assigned. Then, before players are selected, I want to substitute one captain with another player.

I don't see any option for this, even with reshuffling enabled
reshuffle only applies to random seletion
Is there any other workaround you can think of for the situation? The only options I can think of are:
1) The person remains captain, but someone else picks on their behalf in VC
2) We cancel the match and start over (which wouldn't work if other people are already in queue).
is it possible to allow players to join the next queue if they already voted for previous queue but the queue isnt submitted yet?
its by default
unless you have changed it
i mean, there is not really a proper solution for that tbh
what is the command?
-d requeue condition
the default is must vote?
if its must vote then they cannot join until queue is submitted no? in my case i have to choose winner selected?
The default requirement is voting for a winner, not necessarily a winner being picked
ok so right now if i voted i cannot join a new queue until the queue is submitted, how do i change it so if someone voted he can join right after it
Then change it
to winner selected?
Must vote if it isnt
But that should just work
If you press the button, youre able to queue
<@648635725964902411> Any clue to why my mapsets aren't saving in my queue?
Youre not saving it on the queue you using, or youre creating a new queue every game. Those are the only chances
I don't know how to create new Queues though
if u do /info and go to the 4th page, do u see the maps?
It doesn't let me go to 4th page

I got it now
It does show map
How do i remove my ign?
Is there a way to redirect players to a specific text channel after a match ends?

In my test server, I have a #general channel and I have a #matchmaking channel. I want to only manage queues in the #matchmaking channel.

When a match ends for players, I want to direct them to the #matchmaking channel immediately so that they can requeue. However, they're instead always moved to the #general channel.

Is there any way to set this?
Nope
Well, no directly, i do believe you get redirected to the first channel in the category youre in
-d set ign
yea like Don Soap said, theres no way to have someone open a text channel, at least that i'm aware of with the Discord API
<@648635725964902411> Thank you! I was thinking it was probably a Discord thing. I realized that I hadn't set a parent category for #matchmaking, so Discord was using its own logic

Is there a way to disable the win and loss displaying on the leaderboard leaving just the mmr of players
Nope
Ok saj
how,do,i,make,the,join,queue,button,appear
(my,spacebar,brok)
how do i allow users without admin to run commands like /stats, im a admin and can run it but a average player cant
the leaderboard isn't working in my server even after i vote it says i haven't voted
I was wanting to see if the end result for a queue I‚Äôd like to make is possible. The short version is a queue where it‚Äôs is play-all 5 games, teams are randomized after each game, and mmr is assigned on a per-person basis after all 5 games are played based on how many games they individually won/lost. 
No problem if not, was just curious since I couldn‚Äôt figure it out from the documentation.
Thank you in advance :)
is it possible to add slowmode for queue channels?
where should i put "none" i dont understand
it says right there
in account i should put none?
or where
or i should put my account and put type none but where
it doesnt work
LIKE THIS?
still not deleted
Did u run the command while that match was running?
could be, but is this the right command?
You can use `/ign` to change your own IGN
-d ign
oh wait, you cant remove it hmmm
ye i know i can change
so impossible to remove it?
only with /set ign i guess
ill need to update the /ign command
it doesnt work, or i did it wrong
are you staff in the server
ye it needed i think
im elo admin  ye
but this command should work for everyone
but i didnt understand where should i put "none"
what am i doing wrong
yea just type none for the account
i need to tag user
it says
If u changed it during the match you wont see any effect till next match
the admin just said its not possible
no don soap is correct, I meant its not possible with /ign apparently
Is the duo command no longer a thing
where should i type none i dont understand
if i type it in account it doesnt work
Try acct as the discord account
Like ur discord user in the acct box
-d set ign
but where should i put "none" after it
you need to specify the user
`/set ign account:none user:@lior99`
The what
It‚Äôs party create now
Was looking on how to queue with someone to be on same squad
its working u need to create party and then to invite your premade
thanks!
yea the party system is what you want
am I dumb or is there no way to set "admin" users or roles for the bot and you have to have admin perms to the server for it to work. I found the ability to set staff but not admin and staff has limited perms
-d staffrole
has full control over the bot
otherwise anyone with Manage Channels permission can use any command
so i am dumb, when looking through the list of commands to add or remove I only saw the same set, but because there was no scroll bar I didnt realize it was a limited list since discord doesnt show a scroll when used in that format. tried just now to search for other commands and that worked. Ty
Love this bot, ty for making it. Will get really into using it when mecha break comes out but toying with setup for now
How do I vote for something?

Is there a way to make it so I can change the number of votes needed for a rematch but not affect the number of votes needed for other things? Like not doing it through the default vote number
hey does that also bring back the mmr that was previously assigned to people and leaderboard?
Not really
is it possible to get back resetted leaderboard and mmrs of players playing?
like from some last backup or something if possible
the mod by mistakenly did endqueue and it resetted everyones mmr
Ending the queue doesnt reset the stats
oh so is there anything we could do to get the data back
like such
Just load the config again
we don't have it saved
-d config list
but this is the queue that got resetted
next-queue and beyond-queue are different channels
Ok, the config is for mostly just the setup u had, but stats are attached to queues name, so if you create a queue with the name NEXT, you should have back your stats
how can i change the limit time for voted? rn if queue started u cant vote in the first 3 mins i think
-d timer winnervote
i wanna show team 1 and 2  it's private channel
<@145305657237700608>

Example: `https://www.adorama.com/alc/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/landscape-photography-tips-yosemite-valley-feature.jpg`
So it would need to follow like: `https://www.web.com/file.png`
Just wanted to run this by someone, we've had the bot up and running for a long time but lately the last few days, after a match has ended and we've voted for it, it will either say we still need to vote or "this interaction failed" when we try to queue again. It was working fine before and only seems to be happening now. No changes made as far as i am aware
Yo can anyone help me
<@648635725964902411>
Just ask
How do I make it so players have to register before accessing channels for q-ing
I checked guide and I didnt see it?
Registration in what sense
Because theres not really a proper registration
The options are, registering an account name of a game that are available or custom, or to register your ign
like I have a channel called üìù - Register / and i want people to do a command like /register then once they do they get access to queue channels and can play.
Or i can do it with a react role
<:Shrug:1171270284670668830>
Theres not really such thing to give like an access to a channel. You just get no option to queue if the requireregister is on, which i think is not really what you want
But the command is, if u wanna see /requireregister
Ok thanks!
prob will be better
also i alr have queues set up how do I just change the nameof it? or will I have to set it up again?
and last thing is there a q ban command?

Is there a way to "refresh" the UI to show the queue in a given channel?

Let's say I create a channel with a queue. The option to Join that queue is displayed. Now let's say people are chatting in that channel, the "Join Queue" UI is pushed up the page quite far. Now, if someone wants to join the queue, they have to scroll up to find it. 

Is there a command that will just redisplay it as the most recent message in the channel?
It should re send the message after a few seconds
But personally, i do not recommend making the queue channel open to typing

Is there a way to make a global queue (a queue that two separate servers I own share)
Theres no possible way of making uneven teams afaik
Thats by default
There was, but it got deleted
okay thanks
is there a way to declare multiple winners?
or only one
Only one
damn
So I have multiple maps I want to use for my 8s server , and we are playing a best of 3. Is there a way for the same map to stop showing up for game 1 and game 2 , without going into /add map and doing it 1 ect as it‚Äôs currently /add map 1,1
If that makes sense
/map add map_name:1,1?
What does that mean
You do that with discord perms
So /add map (name) 1,1 only means it can be played on gamemode 1 or 2 and not 3.
But every now and then it makes the same map gamemode 1 and 2
You only have one map?
I mean, theres no restriction when it comes to randomness, so you cant really tweak that behavior
No I have 8 maps , and I know it‚Äôs random and the chances of it happening is medium but was just curious to see if I can stop it from re picking
Out of 8 maps is repicking always?
You gotta tweak the perms, visible perms within the category for everyone
so for /hero voting
is per_team supposed to allow for both teams to do blind bans? Not sure how its supposed to work when it is disabled. Also in live and in documentation it says the same thing as map voting " If the map vote goes team by team. Team 1 picks first ban, Team 2 picks next, ..."
Yea so per_team means it goes team by team, 1 vote at a time
Is turning it off supposed to make it blind? because both teams still seem to go back and forth and you can kinda tell who is voting what since it still shows the list and the votes.
unless it didnt test properly for me
turning it off just means both teams can vote at the same time
ill try it again, but it may be related to how it says map voting? so maybe there is something with that?
<@145305657237700608> I need help using this bot. It's so confusing
<@648635725964902411>
I need help
I want to setup this not in my server
For scrims
<@51445866115891200>
oh hmm the message seems to just be messed up
note that the documentation site says the same, not sure if they pull from each other
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
yea they are directly linked, ill have to update it
is there anyway to add an observers role to the matches? i want the people with observer role to be able to view the match chat, and match vc but they cant unless i manually do it
/voicechannels permissions set
The bot just randomly started creating these weird channels under a new category out of nowhere. How can I turn this off? <@145305657237700608>
you probably have alot of matches being played? The bot keeps a pool of channels ready for these cases cuz bots can't create infinite channels in a server
theres a discord rate limit which would block the bot from creating more channels
currently at match #2637. so is this a permanent thing from now on then? or will it sort itself out?
its daily, so if you hit a threshold for daily matches it will start keeping channels in the pool
it cleans up automatically if its not needed
ok cheers
there seems to be some sort of issue with updating the elo
the match ended but after requeuing the players mmr still looks the same without the win / loss of the game before
<@145305657237700608> I tried to change the name of my queue and it set it to "player stats" and I can't change it back. When I use the /queuename command, it only gives me the option to use "player stats" anything I type in it auto changes it to "player stats" How do I change this?
Is there a reason why the image for the first page of the mmr leaderboard won't show up? The first image shows this issue, the second shows the second page, the third shoes the first page of last month's mmr leaders, and the fourth is the first page of the wins category. It's only the first page of the current month's mmr. This is a seemingly constant thing, where sometimes it loads, and sometimes it doesn't.

I know text works, and the website does too. It's just nice being able to share the image when announcing the upcoming end of the month, for instance.
I do /leaderboard, type, mmr, queue name, and then page 1
try that
after page 1 hit enter
Did the same thing for me. Still no pic on page one
Yea I don't have the date on my drop down menus...not sure why that's coming up
Do you have it automatically reset monthly? We do
I have no idea, I don't even think we've had it a month yet
Oh okay lol
I had 5 queues that I want to share the same stats for 1 leaderboard, and another single queue for another leaderboard but im struggle to figure it out
The first 5 queues:
```/queuename name:ABC```

The single queue:
```/queuename name:XYZ```
** **
** **
I ***think*** that's how it works. Been a bit since I did that,
Do I have to rename every queue to the same name ?
Once you rename one, I *think* it'll show up an option for the others
So yes, but you only have to type it once
So I‚Äôve done the 5 queues leaderboard, but I can‚Äôt seem to find the other single queue when creating a new leaderboard
Where do I find this file?
How does balance by roles work if a user as multiple roles used in balancing?
AI is hallucinating
hmm yea i have seen this before, there must be something unique to the first page
i‚Äôll look
<@145305657237700608> I noticed that it only shows the leaderboard for a specific queue. Is there a way to showcase a leaderboard done in all queues?
Not really without combining every stat of each queue
How do I cancel this?
`/cancel` or `/outcome cancel` if youre admin
yeah i,m Admin
Hello guys I have a problem when start a queue it says we all have to join voice but I put on false the voice channel
I want it not to appear in any game
<@648635725964902411> help
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608> please respond fast, people are asking me questions
You can disable the lobby VC with /lobbychannel
Thats how a winner is voted
You didnt ask a question
Not me. I meant other people
Why is the queue not starting despite it being full?
Thats a matchmaking queue
do you know how can I set a channel to change the winners after the game?
it should be like this
Mathcmaking queue will search for players with similar mmr and wont start untill all players fall between a similar range
-d staffchannel set
ok ty
do you know if I can reset the leaderboard to set all the players to 0 games?
how can i add logo/screen here
i remember it was possible
-d message queuemessage image
Do u want to reset everything or just the games
<@145305657237700608> I am really sorry for tagging you but it seems you've missed my message
oh its only premium, ima buy the premium now üòÑ
Hello I need help with being able to see all active queues for people that aren‚Äôt in the queues
I get this request a lot and I‚Äôm not sure how to fix it
can i make the bot NOT seperate people into vcs? I want all the players in the queue to be in one vc only, no seperation
you can disable `/voicechannels teamchannels toggle`
is there any command for the admin to pull all of us into the initial vc's
can u explain to me about this command?
change the color of this ones
hey, how can I remove the first pool when a pug queue is created?
the team selection one
i want to always be random the team selection, is this possible?
-d teamselection set
Is there no way to stop the map showing on game 1 and game 2 . To stop duplicates showing. I‚Äôve done /map add (name) 1,2,3
you know how can I see the autoroles that I have made? And if the bot removes the earlier role when reaching new one
-d info
How do I outshine people on the voice?
Outshine?
Number of players in the voice
I dont understand what you trying to say
u see 00 | 05
i want for example 7
how can i set the bot to look like on ss
That is the teamsize
-d teamsize
-d roles
is it possible if i ban someone and then he gets auto role?
<@145305657237700608>  I tried to change the name of my queue and it set it to "player stats" and I can't change it back. When I use the /queuename command, it only gives me the option to use "player stats" anything I type in it auto changes it to "player stats" How do I change this?
not currently
try with
-d leaderboardconfig sharedstats
No that did not work, it only allows me to type "player stats" still
You should be able to type whatever you want
the popup names are just suggestions, but not limiting you
although it should not show "player stats" if the internal name was "player_stats", let me see
is the same map showing always ?
why for some players i can see tie stats, and for others i cant?
im number 10 and i had tie matches, but cant see them in leaderboard
yo can u send me the server scrims server plz?
why? are u an admin here?
Does it show on the website leaderboard?
nope, https://www.neatqueue.com/lb/ELORealSoccerLeaderBoard
Ah on the website it doesnt show so nvm
how can i fix it? or its just a bug
how do I make this type of queue? <@145305657237700608>
You cant do anything
Also no clue why it doesnt show on dc
https://www.neatqueue.com/guide
I want that when I enter this call, it automatically creates a text channel and that the bot sends the queue list to the channel it created.
<@145305657237700608> maybe u can try to check it, seems like a bug
You need to met the teamsize to start a game
but I don't know how to set a specific call to be like a waiting queue
<@648635725964902411>
I joined the call and a chat automatically appeared for me to join the queue
-d lobbychannel set
-d readyup mode
but that doesn't create a chat like in the video
That chat is not created, its just hidden from you if you dont join the vc
I guess the way the made it, its using an autorole inqueue, you need to modify the role's perms to be able to see the chat
-d autorole inqueue
How do you make the bot move the people who are in the top call to the bottom calls?
this bot is very complicated
Setting a lobby channel, people will be move from there bu default
Its just highly customizable
I just wanted that when the 10 players entered the call waiting queue, a chat would open where the queue was and after the 10 players entered the queue, the captains would be chosen, after the captains chose their players, the bot would automatically move each one to the specific call
You can do that by using the commands i have mentioned earlier
but I can't, I've tried everything
thats pretty much the default
I can't select the call for players to enter the queue, I can't make the bot automatically move players within the queue to specific calls, I can only get this
I wanted to do what the elo remix (bot) did
but I just don't use it because of the record limit
why don't you guys make a mini video tutorial on how to create a lobby and the exact permissions etc.
Because the initial set up doesnt aim for that
I already sent the basic guide
because I'm having to use a translator, especially since I'm from another country
If you get a basic queue working, customizing it, wont be hard
but it is not possible to understand the basic guide very well
If there was a video tutorial, there wouldn't be this whole conversation
would save a lot of people who don't understand the language
if i have premium there is 150 game limit for each queue or for all the queue?
all queues
Well, better said, the game limit for the server
Is there a way to make it where a certain role loses LESS or gains more mmr in certain queues?
not an official way, for gaining more mmr you can use mmr multipliers, altough for losing less, theres not an option or workaround i can think of
honestly /mmr change set should be per role, defaulting to everyone
similar to how /startingmmr works
mmr change ? It can separate the amounts per role per queue?
no, im saying it should be üòÑ
Ohh yeah that would be good for tier level play. 

I have 5 tiers 

And when I have a S tier play in a A-S tier lobby I feel like the S tier should lose less in the queue
Incentivize the play in both queues either 1. To play for some mmr with lower tier players and. B. Incentivize the higher level lobbies be made
how do I make sure anyone can start the queue the channelrestrictions command doesn't work
neatqueue dosnt setup even tho i gave it owner and staff roles that have promition to manage channels
Wdym can start the queue? Thats automatic

You gotta make sure nothing is overriding the bot's perms
Is there a way to mass reset everyone's stats that is under a certain mmr? Like maybe by assigning them a role and then resetting everyone with that role or something?
I'm talking about roughly a thousand users^
-d autoroles mmr
Would do the thing, but, i think it wont change everyone that meets the condition at once
How do I show the match when it ends on a specific channel?
the leaderboard isn‚Äôt working after i vote any reason why?
How can I make the leaderboard display specific roles? this way I can add points manually for those roles and use NeatQue strictly as a leaderboard for teams.
Type: <@857633321064595466> i voted, on your server
-d resultschannel
Theres not really a way to do that, you could try messing with
-d leaderboardconfig ignoreroles
i need to make room match logs <@648635725964902411>
what did u give to it
just type the name, it should pop up
thx bro
is there a command so i can look at X player all matches history and how much mmr he lose and gets?

The setup we have for teams isnt supported by NeatQueue, we have NQ running queues and supplying MMR changes but I need a way to grab the MMR changes as they happen and apply them elsewhere, is there a doc I can go over that covers an endpoint or webhook that provides that info?

Thanks in advance
the command /startqueue can do it only administrator role
You dont need to run that command every time a match is created
The queue is just a game generator
The only thing that starts and ends is the match, not the queue
yes but how do I make it so that everyone can do /startqueue
not only those who have the administrator
Why do u want that
because i want all people to be able to start but i dont want them to have administrator in my server
You dont need to create a new queue every single time, thats what im saying, also there is a limit of 3 for free plan
You dont want that, or maybe youre not understanding how it works
ah okok sorry i'm italian and i'm using translator
and instead it is possible to have the channel deleted by the bot (ex; queue-32) without having voted for the winner and the mvp?
Nope, the only way would be cancelling the match
How can I see the number of games played per day in a queue over a set period of time? I plan to graph the data.
For that you will need to use the API endpoint history: https://api.neatqueue.com/docs#/default/history_api_history__server_id__get
How to yellow all dots in neatqueue bot
help me
question, how do I link Valorant to the bot so it can track stats?
and games/wins/losses
The bot is not really made for that
help
I dont understand whats "yellow all dots"?
how do i remove a queue from a channel?
-d enqueue
how can i do like this
-d queuetype
Hello i just discover this awesome plugin !! However there is some stuff that i didn't succeed to make and i would like to know if it's possible, and having help therefore.

When my queue is full at 4/4 i would like that the game start, but a other empty queue arrived for the next 4 people, like they can always joins and come. Or my queue automatically got clear since the 4 people are going to play theirs own game
Hello do you know if mmr multiplier means multiplier for win , lose or both?
thats the default settings
is it possible to do if someone gets to X mmr he is getting auto ban?
You can set an autorole
And then do /bannedroles add
hello i've got this msg even tho i paid
Well, we fulled the queue 4/4, wait 5 minutes, didnn't join the vocal, got bann 3 minutes which is normal and then we were all into the queue again
But what do you mean
By default, everyone has to join the voice channel to start the match itself
When you get into the match creation, your queue its free for other people to join
Yeah, i would like to remove this, i don't want people to come into voice channel, cuz they are tied of 4 players (since it's a 2v2 game) **but** there could be spectators throught screenshare for exemple, so i don't want this feature
-d readyup
You can disable it using that command
I want :

1- People join the queue
if there is 4/4 the match started, a new 0/4 appears allowing new players to fillup the queue
if after 5 minutes no one started the match the queue pull everyone and it's 0/4 again
gonna check that, thx
Hey if i set up a queue for 1v1s is it possible to have multiple 1v1 queues going on at the same time without having to create seperate queues and channels?
the bot will handle it for you
so if one queue is already happening can people still queue while a game is going on
If so many people ask this question, maybe you can make it more clear in the documentation or video ?
I gave the bot and the role manage channel perms

guys what is a key
when you do /votingmenu
like when you do votingmenu add
and there's a key option
-d votingmenu add
it shows up in the final teams message
Like if you add a vote for ‚ÄúSelect a region‚Äù with key: ‚ÄúRegion‚Äù, then it would show up in the final message as ‚ÄúRegion: NA‚Äù
Hi is there a way I can set up voting for categories like trivia, chess, checkers, 1v1 in a game and then afterwards another voting pops up for that specific category to pick for example the map if it's a game, the type of trivia if its a trivia
so basically sub voting categories for each category
Don't think so, thats a bit too involved to achieve
aa alr

Hello, I'm trying to transfer my credits to another discord server that also has NeatQueue, but it's stating that it could not find the server via server ID.
Is NeatQueue in both servers?
but I can't seem to transfer it to the other server
Is it possible to schedule/toggle a command across multiple days of a week? I want to see if I can schedule party queue to automatically only be active for 5 days of the week.
There is
-d schedule
but that only works for daily commands since you can only set a time
for something more complicated you would have to use the API to invoke the command when you want
how do i make it to where roles change based on mmr
-d autroles mmr
would it change on discord server too, i have certain roles on for certain mmr
how would i do that
or do i have to do that manually
What do you mean by that
so on the side of ur server you have certain roles right that we can see , so i put it a top 10 etc and im trying to have it auto put u on that role
and to display it on the side
i did the auto roles n everything and tested it but it still doesnt assign that player the role
Do you have too many players? I think fetching everyone can take a while
Also you tested like giving yourself certain mmr that falls between the range to test?
yea i tested that
cxan u join the support call rq

okay, can you help me when your home, or if theres someone else that can help
When I use the /votingmenu add command it requires you to fill out the options field even if you put variables into the options_variable field. If you include both of them in the command it only uses the options in the options field and won't use options_variable
I tried asking the bot for help but it's not making sense to me
It also keeps referencing a readme that I can't find
-d votingmenu add
Do I need to write something specific into options for it to work?
it should definitely use the options_variable if its supplied
should this work?votingmenu add title:test1 options:a,b,c key:answer team_voting:All Teams options_variable:1,2,3
oh wait not that one
votingmenu add title:test1 key:answer team_voting:All Teams options_variable:1,2,3
do you have multiple voting menus?
The options_variable would only be used after the first vote
I don't have any voting menus atm
It won't let me enter the command without adding options and putting something in that arguement
Even though i am using options_variable
Might it have something to do with captians mode?
ye it wont do anything if you dont have any other voting menus
its so you can chain voting menus together
Results of voting menu 1 become options in voting menu 2
Ohhhhh
otherwise dont worry about it and just use Options
Thanks for the help
Wait so how do I get options variable to chain from a previous voting menu
if I make a voting menu with /votingmenu add title:test1 options:1,2,3,4,5,6 key:idk team_voting:Team 1
and have no other menus before that one
then make a second menu with /votingmenu add title:test2 options:a,b,c,d,e,f key:idk team_voting:Team 1 options_variable:1,2,3,4,5,6
It'll just used the a,b,c,d,e,f for the options of the second menu
And if I try and send the command without the options argument (even if I have the options_variable argument) it tells me that options is a required argument
It also requires me to put something into options_variable
how to change the quantity of a specific role? like CB is default to (2) In team size but i want it change to CB (4) and Gk to 2 Instead Of 3
<@648635725964902411> Hello sir,

We ran a tournament yesterday, and have 8 teams/parties sign up. However 1 team notified us they could not make it, but their captain was unavailable to remove themselves from the sign ups.

Is there a command to remove a specific team/party that has signed up so we dont have to start the tournament with them included?

Thanks

(Please @ me back if anyone has the answer to this so I can see it).
you need the options_variable for both voting menus
so it knows they are linked
`/roles CB,CB,...`
you should be able to `/player remove` the captain
What do I put in the options_variable field for both menus?
Just the options I want?
it doesn't matter, its just a unique identifier to link them
Thanks, but it seems you need to remove all players from the party, but if a party signs up with a name such as 'topteam' how do we identify which players are inside that team easily? Is it possible?
ah, good point, it doesn't seem to work with parties
send me the channel ID and I can let you know who to remove, sorry not a great solution
Is there a way to see the results of a voting menu before all of the menus are done? If there‚Äôs not it‚Äôs not the end of the world, it would just be a nice qol thing

How can I fix this?

Yeah, it doesnt exist
Hmm, what do you mean?
Hero add, hero bans, map bans, different things
Altough i have never used hero commands
You can probably put an empty string using language override

Yeah, looks like its not available
Ai is just hallucinating, we are working on that so it gives better answers. But no, theres no option to change the bot's pfp
Does `/api/matches/{server_id}` store before/after MMR when a match is ongoing?
I'm trying to figure out how to store MMR changes but I'm unsure which endpoint would have that, `/matches` is currently empty bc no matches going on so I'd love to know what values it stores when a match does happen to go on
hi how do i get neatQ in my server?
thank you so much
the / queuename doesnt show cod for me
after i have invited it to my server
yes, would you like to join it and try to see for yourself if that will work?
the /map add cmd does not work
someone know how to set that up or how it works for the bot to randomize the map after queuing?
i did exactly that ^ and nothing worked.
<@145305657237700608>

# How to make queue without people to earn or lose MMR? Like unranked QUEUE

Set it to 0
is there a way to see the action[‚ÄúTEAMS_CREATED‚Äù] json again, e.g. from the transcript? sometimes it fails to send and then I have to redo the whole match again
no, there really should be samples in the docs
if its team by team, but only 1 map to pick, it will only do a single vote
That setting is meant for say a best of 3, team 1 picks first map, team 2 picks second, team 1 picks third
when we do map voting and game mode voting. why is it that only team one can vote
-d map voting
when the new channel is made to do map selection and splits the team.. how do i make those channels private so no one can join?
Thats by default
But you can just adjust the category channel perms
okay thank you
cuz mine was not set that way by default
so idk what to do now
how to let anyone do /party create
YCGR has admin but non admins cant use /party for some reason
Did u disable it via server integration?, that would be the only way
where would I find that?
Server settings, integrations
is this correct?
Should be aight
If it doesnt work, then you probably disabled the ability to use slash commands on that channel
Im not the server owner
prob gonna have to ask
how can i check for this?
channel, category or role perms
Works now thanks

Hey there, is there a way to setup a Global Leaderboard from Multiple Queues?
each queue also needs to have their own Leaderboard
Can some one help me setup the bot for siege tenmans in my server ive tried and messed somethings up with the register stuff and had to turn if off for the mean time but would like it to work as in tended
<@145305657237700608> Hi. Why I can't see channels transcript sometimes?
You can have a global leaderboard if you name the queues the same, but these ones will just share stats. And having also a queue with their own lb while having a "global one" is not possible
you know what is the `/register` command for?
what is this bug? <@648635725964902411>
first cap chose 1, then i was the other captain, and i couldnt pick anyone except sparta
Not sure
is it possible for the rolerequirement command to be mandatory to have more than 1?
It‚Äôs because of the party
you have to select the party otherwise the other team would have too many players
and if someone wants to choose the solo player and not the party?
The bot will try its best to ensure teams are the same size
so it‚Äôll force you to select parties if they can only fit on 1 team
i see what you are saying actually, they would be auto selected at the end so you could pick any solo player, hmm
do you have test mode on accidentally?
yea in test mode it will only require 1 vote for everything
is it possible to use trueskill/openskill with neatqueue?
<@145305657237700608>
no you can't change the MMR system in that way
besides whats available in /mmr
is neatqueue open source?
cause I could always do that myself
How do i remove maps and game modes

Hello need some assistance with temp categories and channels, its currently setup where the match creates its own category and channels in that category however after a match is completed the channels are deleted, but the category isnt deleted. is there a way to automatically delete the category?

Help?
Require register is set to Rainbow 6
massage queue sticky when i enable it 
the bot doesn't remove the previous queue message
any help
Thats just gonna pull the rating btw, so nothing crazy, also this type of setup is kinda handy to do
any help please ?
HOW CAN I LET THE QUEUE SHOWN
there is no command for lose?
-d webhooks generatetoken
i mean, i can control the mmr given per win, but per lose i cant?
Make sure the bot has permissions to send messages
Not with multipliers
multipliers are supposed to be like "bonuses"
for normal MMR changes you would use
-d mmr change
but this command is for mmr change in general, not per rank
isnt it?
correct
theres not a great way to set MMR change per role
that would be a good feature
i want to control the mmr given in each rank per win\lose
its not possible?
no but thats not normally a thing you want imo
why not, i have around 10 ranks and i want to make it very hard in high ranks to climb
and very easy in low ranks to climb
but sadly i can do it only per wins
i think its good if u add also for lose
How do I add roles to a queue that is already created? (Tank, support, etc.)
-d roles add
-d roles
the higher MMR you have, the less you gain in general
since the average enemy will have a lower MMr
yeah ik, but it can also be good if you are in very low mmr so u also not losing that much
thats also how it works by default
-d mmr change variance
ye but i have to make it even  more easier in low mmr
like if u lose 20 i want to make it 10
in the lowest roles rank
massage queue sticky when i enable it 
the bot doesn't remove the previous queue message
How to add the que button
I believe that should be already by default
If not, then you can play with the temp channels permissions
-d tempchannels permissions set
And you can give players in game a role for that
-d autoroles ingame
How to reset points (not mmr)?
i did reset all but it didnt reset the points
You can /set points points:0 to everyone

-d outcome select winner
How do I show Mmr?

How to hide the players that queued
-d anonymous
Ye tysm bro

to random ones

was working fine
haven't changed anything since
allow the bot to send messages
through permissions in settings
it is active
might be bugged?
probably
queues not starting when filled?
managed to fix the permissions thing but now when 8 players are in game just wont start lmao
If your queue is type matchmaking, that makes sense
how do I change it lmao
it was working not sure if Ive accidentally got conflicting commands
-d queuetype
do PUGs
done and it worked
thank you
can you explain the difference and why it does work with matchmaking?
matchmaking works but better with more players
since it will try to create the fairest match possible
so it waits a bit until it knows nobody else is joining and theres not gonna be a better possible match

Check your /info, the default role requirement is the everyone role
so you should remove it since you only need 1 role requirement to work
honestly it should remove that role by default...

Hi all, what is command to do voting and team  selection without needing to join the created vcice channel
<@648635725964902411>
lobbby channel toggle?
you cant force sub players if you dont have the perms
-d readyup
you can either set it to click a button or disable it
Hi all, i have 3 que. 1 does ready up good. so it wont create a seperate channel to ready up. but the 2 others do create a sperate channel to ready up. any suggestion?
did you run the command on the other 2 queues?
Yess
you sure? what command did you run
/readyup mode disable
readyup is not for that, readyup is to eliminate the need to join a voice channel to start the match
yess i mean this, voice channel*
then it should work
if you ran the command, theres no way it doesnt work tbh, re run it to make sure
i did several times ü´† thats why i dont understand
Go to your second queue channel and type /info
And watch the last text on the first page, **Ready Up** should be disabled
Hardpoint is ok. 3v3 not working
Wait im braindead
-d lobbychannel toggle
Thats the command you want
i think yes i see 1 diffrence that i didnt see before
i will try
thanks!
It‚Äôs also helpful if you need to create new queues, you can copy your existing ones to keep the same settings
then tweak it how you need
-d config
i did but i guess i made it when it wasnt good
I am trying to set up schedule but when I put mountain time it puts everything in AM
you have to use 24 hour time
I set up a game result channel but someone deleted it. how do i add it back into the same q
Just re do the process that you did to set up a result channel
Is there a way to fully reset the bot? The bots acting a little weird & I tried `/endqueue` and stuff but when I write `/leaderboard que_name` it shows the past channels/ques names which I don't want (ex: I had a channel/que named 6-mans, 4-mans, 2-mans and deleted them. it still shows up on /leaderboard que_name) 

Also the `/config list` full of bunch of configs I cant figure out how to remove either. 
Just trying to reset the whole process
You cant delete configs, and you can type the name of whatever queue in the leaderboard command. If you did /endqueue, that might still appear, from it to disappear you would need to reset the stats of that queue and then end it, but maybe it could still pop up but it doesnt really matter
Instead of 6-mans, 4-mans, 2-mans I am trying to create Rank A, B ,C etc... 

So if someone types /leaderboard command, wouldn't they see the "6-mans" leaderboard, which doesn't exist anymore?
hence making it confusing
No, if you run /leaderboard it will just show the queue that is attached to
hmm yeah, i only really asked because when you write `/leaderboard`, extra options pop up.
just trying to minimize confusion just in case those deleted leaderboards show up
I mean, why would you want people to run /leaderboard many times?
Its better to just put a desired channel for it
Hii all, question. can we put leaderboard of a que in another channel? where the que was not setup
how do i stop a test mode?
Would the mmr reset? Because the setup would be in a different q
You dont need a new queue
Just do /resultschannel
-d link
This is what I was looking for. I jsut set up a new queue lol
My queue name is permanently 5v5 Random, I have tried to change it, reset it, kick the bot and pretty anything I can think of and it won't change any help ?
/queuename?
Yeah its just static
It won't change no matter
The names for everything work besides the name in this generated message
Thats weirs
Did u try to remove and add again the staff channel
Like the channel I used for the bot ? No I'll try that and get back to you !
I mean /staffchannel
Ahhh
Do /staffchannel remove
Then /staffchannel set
Again
No luck. It's like a separate name selection that won't delete from when I created the first queue
how do i change the name
-d queuename
Hi, how do I reset the row numbers?
when I set the lobby timer to 2 minutes `/lobbychannel timer` but disable the lobby vc, users only have 30 seconds to check in no matter what I try to do <:hanaconfuse:985765666760040498>
How do I reset the lobby numbering? <@648635725964902411>
You cant, if you mean the `queue#number`
is there a way to resolve this bug?
Are you on test mode?
Whats your process, because it works perfectly fine for me
perhaps i could just send the config
CYWBG
I just did `/lobbychannel timer 120` and it works fine
<:owoThinking:356735628190416896>
Load this config if it helps
`SEISI`
I'll give that a try when i get back to my pc
Im trying to enable reshuffle, but its not showing for people, anyone know what im doing wrong?
It will show on the next match
If u did it when a match was going
I‚Äôve tried a few times last few matches and they‚Äôve said it‚Äôs not showing x
it only works for random team selection as well
any work arounds here to have it queue specific?
Its lying, configurations are isolated, they dont share between queues
And you can also just choose the queue
okay i'l check
that worked, thanks <a:SuperDizzy:945310336511270922>
afaik, havent tried it
it doesn't seem like they're isolated. I did the ratinginname _format and for prefix, for 1 queue with a [$] but then {4} for another queue channel and it overrided with the latter
Ah seems like it overrides
Then is not possible
the ratinginname command is server wide since nicknames are server wide as well
Makes sense
How do I solve this problem?
Didnt u send the same problem like a month ago
And you havent figured out?
Is there a way for a game to award multiple 'teams' as winners?
Nope
yes need help

Hello! I've recently taken over ownership of a server and ever since the new year, our leaderboard command has been broken; every time someone runs the command or tries to refresh the leaderboard message, the bot says "Unexpected error occurred, this has been recorded". However, we have been able to retrieve the leaderboard stats by following the website link to the leaderboard.

What are steps I should take to resolve or debug the error to get the leaderboard message/commands working again?
I want to know where I pay to have unlimited queues?

<@145305657237700608> Is there any way to setup the bot so that when it is selecting maps randomly there will be no duplicates? Like it selects from the list of strings provided, but it removes the item(or map in this case) from the list of available options so as to remove the option for duplicates?
do you mean duplicates in the same match?
the easiest way would be to change the permissions in the Server Integration settings
starts at 1.4x and slowly decreases to 1x during 10 matches
I think i figured it out, the other admins for the server had each map set with each mode, for example map: Frontier, mode: Hotzone and also Frontier, mode Splitball etc. I think this was causing it to select a "unique" map that just had a different mode attatched to it
How do I change the voice name of the bot?
how do i make it drag everyone in like the q to the call
Sorry to bother again, is the decrease linear?
Also, that‚Äôs odd, I‚Äôm in a server where the MMR change is set to 15, and the first game of the queue gave an MMR change of 20, which clearly isn‚Äôt 1.4x
<@145305657237700608> I currently have a queue which I think uses player_stats. I want to start a new season but want to keep the old stats which can be checked by a leaderboard. Is it possible to carry over the current player_stats to a new season_1 stats and then keep the player_stats in memory to act as a season 0, such that season_1 stats continue updating but player_stats doesnt? Is it also possible to rename player_stats to season_0 for convenience?

tldr: I want to rename the current player_stats to season_0. I then want to implement seasons into the queue such that each season follows on from the last but the old season stats do not change. I also want to make a "legacy leaderboards" channel where there are multiple leaderboards for the old seasons if possible.

If any of this is possible, how would/should I go about it?
The bot says it doesn‚Äôt have perms to manage text channels but it does
Can someone help
If i wanted to setup the bot to allow players to choose which army they are using for a game in the que and track their armies seperately how would i do that?

You can disable lobbychannel creation, then set a lobby channel where your players will be pulled from when the teams are done
-d lobbychannel toggle
-d lobbychannel set
Stop pinging him lmao
i think i will pass on that
you should be able to /player remove the captain?

<@145305657237700608> The bot is dead

how to make it so that when someone is in the queue vc and when queue starts they get moved to the queue vc
Hi <@145305657237700608>, I'm really really sorry to bother you again, but I'm not sure if you simply chose not to answer (totally understand if you did) or overlooked it, and it might be something about the bot that doesn't work as you intended, so I just wanted to make sure: You claimed that the multipliers for placement matches start at 1.4x (https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/868549627652214794/1382164341201047562). However, when testing and in all real queues I've seen, the multiplier starts at (4/3)x. Is this the way it should be?
Posted this issue (https://discord.com/channels/505102060119916545/868549627652214794/1379524014619492495) as a forum since this is still unsolved. I'd appreciate any help I can get!

Anyone able to like hop in a vc and help me out with leaderboards and such?

Problem: Trying to link 3 leaderboards together using /leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide. When I try to display this leaderboard it says there is nothing linked. Im not understanding what is going wrong here. Do i need to make an unusable queue to link it with the name I want?

Maybe a good suggestion for the bot: Making sure you do not have the same map and gamemodes twice in a row. We play 8s for example in Halo and most maps have multiple gamemodes for it. Would be annoying to play the same map twice with different gamemodes

I even tired starting over. Every configuration adds this option. Grrrr
I didn‚Äôt get a response to this but also, can you take the sub feature away from people or only make it available before teams have been formed?
I've got a test queue set up, but it keeps complaining about doesn't have manage channels but it does:
hi ken
that is definitely the command. Its enabled by default which is why restarting shows it
Ok, so the only way to essentially reset it back to 1 would be to completely start another config?
No, you just cant reset it
How do i prevent party queues from getting priority/ filtering out solo queue players into the next queue

Can you add two neat q bots to the same server but with different commands?
-d autoroles
so if i want to have two separate qs for two different games do i have to make two different servers?
No, you can have multiple queues in the same server
why is it looking like this
You probably have embed links or images disabled
Or some like that in the perms
i need help, the AI isnt being very helpful with this issue: 

i used a config file for one queue to make another queue that was very similar but was 7 versus 7 instead of 8 versus 8. however, because of this, the queue logs are being posted in the 8 versus 8 channel, and i don't know how to switch them into the 7 versus 7 channel. how do i do this?
Do you know who would?
you have a forum channel which im messaging you in
The normal results or the staff channel logs?
how do i change that
Can someone help me? I'm trying to change my channel mode so people join the queue based on being in the voice channel. The buttons disappear, but when someone joins the voice channel, they are not added to the queue. What could be the problem? I already selected the voice channel using the command` /queueentry methods modes:Voice Channel `and also `/queueentry channel set channel:#"Espera MIX PRIME #1".`
hi why mvp vote isn't appearing if I already set it up toggle yes and vote required yes also
Is there a way to see more than 100 messages in the channel transcripts?
it wouldn‚Äôt appear on that message
what do you reckon is a good number, just takes longer to fetch more messages
Maybe 500? I really don't know lol. Having to wait longer is fine, imo
Quick question is there the possibility to create a full team vs full team queue without MMR? Would want it to be more a training than matchmaking. For cups etc.
Tried it to create it with pugs and full team vs full team and both times he wants me to fill out starting mmr.
On our server, we just did an MMR reset. I would like the autoroles to update to reflect the post-reset MMR, but whenever I try to use /autoroles refresh, it keeps the roles from before the reset, even though the NeatQueue bot says, ‚ÄúSuccessfully checked/modified roles for X players.‚Äù

Is there a specific reason why /autoroles refresh isn't working? Could it be because the user already has an autorole that is higher in the role hierarchy than the one that should be assigned during the refresh?
I tried using AI support, but it seems like it doesn't know how to fix it.
is there any way i can set up notifications for when our queue reaches a certain number or it's capacity?
like example, 

"this queue has reached X amount of players"
I am really confused how exactly we can make like /ign command not be accessible at all to normal users? Just that one command.
-d autoping
You can modify command permissions in the Server Integration settings
you can set the /mmr change to 0
depends on how stats were reset but probably because the players are no longer in the queue's "system" so it doesn't manage their roles
Yeah that was the problem, is there a way to set everyone's mmr to a certain value? Should this command work? And after, I do /autoroles refresh?
yes that should work
thanks for the help anyways
<@145305657237700608> hi bro are you available to help me with temp channel perms

can i copy it to another queue without redoing everything
All commands and interactions with the bot are suddenly resulting in this error message, this has been going on for 10 minutes now
This isn't happening for just me, its happening for everyone in the server I am in
happening for me too
it fix or what
not yet
i saw this what is node 1 compared to 2 and 3
looking
it appears to be back up for us now
is there any way i can add messages into the auto ping rather than it just pinging the roles only?
Ah okay thanks!
Does anyone know if there's a way to send players to a selected channel when the match ends? Because look, I set it so that in the 'espera mix' channel they join the queue as soon as they enter, but sometimes there are people who don‚Äôt want to join again. So I wanted to see if there's an option to move them to a channel called 'lobby'
-d lobbychannel set
So I tried doing "/set mmr 1000 @.everyone", and the mmr only gets changed for people who have already entered the queue before. 

Those who haven't entered the queue don't show up anywhere and the "/set mmr 1000 @.everyone" does not seem to affect them as it's like they don't exist in the queue. 

Is there a way to add every single member of a server to be at a certain mmr, even if they have never entered the queue before so that they all show up on the leaderboard or at least exist in the system?
If they havent even clicked "join" in the queue, they are not in neatqueue's data yet
For this case, youll want /startingmmr, which will be applied to new players
this should work if i recall
what makes you think they dont exist in the queue
the problem is they've kept their autorole from before the reset, and now i cant refresh it to represent post-reset values. my only current solution is deleting every single role manually so they dont have the old rank
either way i think the autorole logic should account for people with reset MMR so they lose their role
which would need an update to the bot
that is what I was expecting it to do, but we made the mistake of doing "/managestats reset all" after doing "/managestats reset mmr" in order to erase the win/loss count on the leaderboard, so i believe that wiped every player off the leaderboard/queue system
ah right right
using /set mmr on everyone should be working though
Ah yeah it does, i thought it only would work on "registered" players
nah if you specify a role it should modify all users with the role
one of the few exceptions
Does that break the monthly players? Like, if only 100 people only clicked join queue, and theres 300 people that didnt click, if i do /set mmr to everyone, everyone would count as an active player and immediately fill the monthly players?
should i try to give a certain role to every member in the server and try the /set mmr 1000 @.role to see if that registers them (i believe thats the term you guys use)
nah because it only counts players who actually play a match, not based on queuing anymore
did it not work with everyone?
Oh okey
it only worked for those who were already on the leaderboard, it didn't add people who haven't queued since the reset
Did u check with /stats? Or how
well every member should be showing up on the leaderboard if the command works right?
By default you need at least one game to show
If u havenr changed it
yeah i believe thats the source of my problem, is there a way to make that 0 games
i am already using the starting mmr command so thats not a problem
`/leaderboardconfig requiredgames games:0`
Actually I just checked, I believe the /set mmr 1000 @.everyone DID work for everyone
my mistake, I figured it would make them show up on the leaderboard
Thank you for this though
So its solved?
yes!
thank you for your help

Is there a way to add a user limit to the temp channels that are made, like for example 4v4s capped at 4 each
Thats by default
If you didnt disable channel restriction, or added a spectator role
<@145305657237700608> in my server the /cancel command does not seem to work for anyone? Any reason why that is? Do I need to set the bot perms above every other role?
how do i make it so that when a queue start, a seperate channel for that queue is made
"/tempchannels toggle mode:Enabled" i think
Why do I always get permission errors even after giving it the manage channel permission?

If i were to set the minimum mmr decay to like 1000 in the /mmr decay command. Would players below 1000 get decayed too or only players above 1000?
Mmr decay applies to everyonr
Is there a way to add a text prompt, so player have to add the custom lobby code from the game in their private lobby channel before the votings for who won the game is displayed?

Currently, the votings for who won the game appears as soon as the teams are divided, but then people still need to type the custom lobby code in the chat so that everyone can join in game, but this leads to multiple people posting the lobby codes or the voting message for who won getting burried among the various messages discussing the customs lobby code in-game

So if we can either 

a) Make a prompt so after teams are distributed, 1 person can add the custom lobby code and it will be displayed in the channel and after that the vote for who won will be displayed, or

b) sticky the who won vote message too, like the queue message, or both

please let me know
Vote message will re send and go to the bottom of the channel by default
Oh right, and what about point a, is that possible anyhow
But sounds interesting
Only solution close I think is creating a vote menu but just ask if they have pasted the code in the channel yet (to remind them to do so, or just include it because the rest of the process is semi-automated too)
Does the code have to be manually created or can the bot auto generate one?
Manually
We recently have added neat queue to our server, I have role reacts set up for the MMR but some members it is not registering? Do we have to remove and reassign the role? Or manually update everyone? It is causing some very unbalanced matches and it is not enjoying for our members.
any suggestions?

Is there a way to see a list of channels that are linked to a queue via `/link`?
responded in thread
There was a similar bug report recently but i have not been able to debug it yet
-d mmr change set
1000 mmr is the default starting mmr
-d startingmmr set
i dont think so.... any reason you need to know? i can help manually if needed
I am 1) trying to understand the use case / practical reason for linking, and 2) wanting to know if our server has any linked channels that shouldn't be.
linking is only useful if you want to use commands as if you were using them in a queue channel
like checking /leaderboard in a #leaderboard channel
That's what I assumed but wasn't sure. Thanks for the confirmation. It would be quite helpful to see a list of linked channels. Maybe just a list that populates when using the `/unlink`  command?
Okay cool, good to hear its been reportted
I am having an issue where /ratinginname is not working. I have my format set, my queuename selected, and it toggled on, but I am not seeing MMR in names. I even tried the AI's suggestion of toggling off then on, but still not seeing it. Any suggestions?
is there any way to change the quantity of a role in the queue or nah

Make sure the bot is positioned higher than everyone it should be able to nickname in Discord's role hierarchy
I do.
I am also not seeing a change in colors or buttons now that I have Premium Commands. Could the two things somehow be linked?
Did you run those commands to update them?
does the bot also have permissions to nickname?
What service is people using for image hosting? I have tried five different services (icloud, google drive, box.net, dropbox, and postimage) and I still get a direct link error every time I use `/message queuemessage footer`

any idea on how to stop getting this message so often?  also is there a way to remove voice channels or not require them?
totally wrong
I assume there isn't a setting then for changing nicknames back after they leave the queue, correct? We don't want ranks in names outside of those queuing.
try again now?
unfortunately no
You did it!
also do teams have seperate leaderboard, aside from individual members/players?
How do I reset button colors to default?
is there a way to dm people a specific message once the queue starts
Hello I dont see mmr display whenever i type / im just trying so people can see there mmr next to there name
hello i am trying to have the bot set up multiple games in 1 server how can i do this?
hello, when people try to check the leaderboard it says: 

 No queue found!
If you want a queue in this channel, run /startqueue or /setup!
If you want to control a specific queue from this channel, use /link!

i tried doing setup but it was doing another queue, help me pls thanks
is there a way to manually change how much mmr u gain and lose after youve already done the advanced setup
Hi, doing API posts, is it possible to set all players MMRs in one post? For example, I'm using `/api/v2/set/mmr`

```
{
  "channel_id": 123,
  "mmr": 1500,
  "user_id": 3524253425345
}
```

Instead of doing it one at a time, would become something like:

```
[
    {
    "channel_id": 123,
    "mmr": 1500,
    "user_id": 3524253425345
    },
    {
    "channel_id": 123,
    "mmr": 1500,
    "user_id": 3524253425345
    }
]
```

I have already tried this by wrapping it in a array, but it errors
I guess the term would be API post batching
you should be able to run the command without any arguments
if that doesn't work then thats a bug
if have existing queues then you should use /link
-d lobbydetails
happens after the setup is finished
A queue can create many games at the same time
-d mmr change set
Unfortunately no, all of these APIs are auto generated and take the same form as the commands
-d set mmr
so your only option would be using a role id instead of user id

Yes, you can link multiple queues to the same leaderboard by ensuring they have the same unique stats name. This will allow all queues with the same unique stats name to share the same stats on the leaderboard. If you need further assistance on how to set this up, feel free to ask in the <#868549627652214794> channel for more detailed guidance.

I'm trying to make a 2nd lobby, due to long config I just copied the queue config file and then tried to change the /channel set to the 2nd voice channel and it's not changing , (I refreshed the page after)

Hello! I wanted to see if it‚Äôs possible to have a person choose to join as either team 1 or team 2. Axis or Allies for my server and then be matched by mmr?
Right now I have many different team 1(axis) vs team 2 (allies)queues set up whenever players reach a certain rank. But I feel like matchmaking would be better
No you cant
Which vc
when it makes a new queue channel when enough people have joined, nobody without admin permissions can see the teams created and the vote options as if they cant see the channel history. if someone messages, the bot resends the vote so its at the front and then they can see it. i have no idea how to change it so they can see the teams created.
the players that are in that match should be able to see the channels
they can see the channel but no the message that tells them the teams
<@648635725964902411>
Wdym cant see the message?
If they cant "view" inside the channel that problem comes from how you set the permissions for your server
<:Shrug:1171270284670668830>
they can view and type
they just cant see the first message sent by the bot
ill try get a screenshot
that message
no body can see it only admins
and the vote for winner message can only been seen if someone sends a message so the bot resends it to keep it at the front
<@648635725964902411>
Team 1 and team 2 i wanna make it gr and vl
-d teamnames
uh thats odd, dont really know what could be going on
This for vc?
good morning, I would like to ask a question? can I use two queues and have a single ranking? that calculates both queues but with only one coasification?
To have a single ranking that calculates both queues but with only one classification, you can use the /leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide toggle:Enabled command to link all queues to one leaderboard. This will allow you to have a unified ranking system across multiple queues. However, please note that you won't be able to combine two different MMR systems together, so it's either separate MMR/leaderboards for separate queues or all in one. If you need further assistance or have more questions, feel free to ask in the ‚Å†‚îÇsupport channel for more help.
is what the ai said
How do I make it show everyone's points next to their name?
-d ratinginname
Yo is there a way to cancel queues as admin without the cancel vote
<@648635725964902411>
brasil?
alguem
-d outcome cancel
Guys, does anyone know if it's possible to remove the negative number before the zero?
When I'm at 0 on the leaderboard, and I end up losing 1 match, I go from 0 -> -17.0
-d mmr floor
I wanted to know if it would be possible to remove this negative (-)
Oops, its /mmr minimum
Set it to 0
So if I set it to 0, the number won't be negative?
<:PepeYesSign:1171266936651399279>
Oh, thank you very much
One more thing, is it possible for the mmr variation to be removed after winning the match?
Like, I want the person to earn just 40
-d mmr change
I don't want you to win, 41, 39.8
On `/mmr change set` theres an option that is static, set it to true
I want you to win exactly 40, everyone on the team
Two questions re: Captain Selection:
1. What happens when multiple options are selected for `/captains selection`?
2. What does the "Balanced" option mean? How is it different than say "Highest Rated" or "Lowest Rated"?
Its like teamselection, the options you choose will be diaplayed on how the captain will be selected
So people then vote between the options I selected?
Perfect. Do you happen to know the answer to #2 also?
It probably will be the ones that are the closest to the average mmr between all
Is there a command that makes this go away?
-d teamselection reshuffle
Thanks
how can I reduce the player's mmr?
`/add mmr` use a negative number.
Help me set up the bot
How do I make it so that everyone can enter the channel that the bot creates?
how to make a chat tag depending on the place in the leaderboard?
Like: [Top 1] Valera
He didnt gain mmr even thoe I already Set it
Others got mmr and He didnt
Players cannot accept sub offer for some reason
Does anyone know if it is possible to define in the bot the amount that a given rank will gain?
Example:

[Coal] = 20 Win, 10 Defeat.
[Gold] = 15 Win, 15 Defeat.
[Iron] = 10 Win, 20 Defeat.
[Diamond] = 5 Win, 25 Defeat.
Not possible
The closest thing would be doing an mmr multiplier for each role
-d mmr multipliers set

Is it possible to remove the voting menu for the winning teams?
How do you want to select winners?
Just using /outcome selectWinner (Match number) (Team number)
You can do /message winnermessage results
And put staff only
Thx you
How can I make it where there‚Äôs a voting at the end and when we get the amount of people the ticket closes and gives the winner Mr and the loser deducted mmr
That should be by default <:Shrug:1171270284670668830>

How to get leaderboard
Guys
ded server
No queue found!
If you want a queue in this channel, run `/startqueue` or `/setup`!
If you want to control a specific queue from this channel, use `/link`!
You cant, unless you mean the timer of joining the queue voice channel
i can send an example later of what im looking for i just dont know if im describing it right
how do i link my leaderboard url to a existing q
Uhm, you mean having your stats from one queue to another and sync them?
sorry how do i make a url leaderboard that shows the stats on an existing queue

if you click the leaderboard title it will take you to the website
otherwise

How would I reset the points for queues? I notice that there is a `reset all` command as well as a `reset mmr` command but I don't see one for points.  So what is the easiest way to go about resetting points?
`/set points points:0 role:@everyone`
cheers. now how would I track the points of other players, like a leaderboard for points instead of mmr?
is there a way to reset the queue number, for example setting the queue#xxxx   to 0
Click that, for you it prob says "mmr", just change it to points
thank you very much üëç
hello! could someone help me with the best way to setup a 1v1 queue? i already have 5v5 but we cant get the 1v1 to skip all the voting for captains and all that. would ideally want it to be completely separate from the other queues we have going

Thats how stats work
So if you didnt run any command of those, just name your queues different
they do have different names already and are in different channels ill try disabling serverwide sharedstats
okay thanks that worked! last question sorry is there a way for the opponents to be in the same call together? its auto creating 2 channels

I want to emulate seasons with the queue but also want to keep a permanent leaderboard for every season. I thought I could copy the stats for the queue to a new name and then change the queue name to this new name, allowing me to emulate seasons. However, this does not work and the stats end up being the same set tied to the queue despite being separate. Do I need to end the queue and then remake the queue to successfully emulate seasons, or is there another way?
How do I make it so if you lose to someone that is much higher mmr, you only lose a tiny amount of mmr?
-d leaderboardconfig monthly
-d mmr variance
For this, you can also use the calculator and see whats actually happening:
Using the calculator, you can see that as the variance value goes up, the actually outputted MMR change has lower variance, becoming less sensitive to the difference between player's MMR. In the example with a loser at 1000 MMR and a winner at 1100 MMR, the default variance produces an adjustment of 46.4 MMR for the winner.

https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3qtwvlrw8q
not quite what im looking for. I want to be able to manually reset the stats when a season ends but still be able to display leaderboards for old seasons of the same queue
Then its not really possible
If I end a queue, can I keep the leaderboard up for it? If so, can I then start a new queue with a different name in the same channel and copy across the config to have a new leaderboard?

can you screenshot that? along with the command you are using
When i tried it with Speak to true it does say the role is not valid
Using just the role as argument works tho

you can just enable them

When I try to copy the stats from one queue name to another, I think the copy isnt actually a copy and more of a reference, meaning that editing the copy also edits the original. This might be why I'm struggling to have multiple leaderboards for the same queue. Is this correct or am I missing something?
are you doing /managestats copy?
yeah, when I copy the stats to a new queue name, and then alter that set of stats, it edits both the copy and the original
is there a way around this?

<@145305657237700608> I am trying to have multiple leaderboards for different seasons of the same queue. I am currently trying to migrate season 1 into season 2. I have copied the season 1 stats to a new season 2 stats. I currently have the queue name set to season 1, and when I run `/leaderboard` for either season 1 or season 2 stats they both show the season 1 stats. If I change the queue name to season 2, both of the leaderboards now show season 2 stats. If I change any stats for season 2, the season 1 stats also change.
How can I separate the stats?
can you screenshot your /info on page 3
fyi season 1 is season 0
even If I change the queue name and shared stats name the old stats still also get edited as well as the old leaderboard incorrectly showing the new season
whats the channel ID?

yes stats arent deleted
im looking at your queue now
whats the channel ID for your season 2 queue?
it‚Äôs the same channel, I just change the queue name
could you swap it to Season 2?
just the name or the shared stats name as well?
like use the commands you want to swap seasons
k i changed the queue name to the other season
shared stats name is still season 0
ok then you want do use
-d leaderboardconfig sharedstats
you might want to just disable it then
I have server wide disabled
its not an issue with serverside stats, but your stats arent tied to your queue name
so thats why you see the same stats
I just want the leaderboard to represent the correct stats. no matter if I input season 0 or season 1 for the leaderboard, it always shows the current queue names stats
and I don‚Äôt fully understand how this works
My end goal is to just have a queue with concurrent seasons, where each previous season has its own leaderboard
Do I just have to make multiple queues?
and then copy the stats and config between them
depends if you want to reset stats or not
if you want to reset stats (fresh slate) you just need to change you queue's stats system via the tips in here ^
I essentially want to copy the previous season‚Äôs stats to the new season so that I can soft-reset them instead of a full reset.
yes so if you already did /managestats copy, you can use /leaderboardconfig sharedstats set
using the new name

if you reset stats in an exact copy of a queue, it would impact both queues
I didn't use a reset stats command, I made a new queue using an old config that another queue was based off about a month ago
Is /leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide enabled by default?
did you change the queue name?
I did - does that also reset it?
See #3 here
its not "reset" exactly, you can get it back by changing the queuename or using `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set`
Thanks, all makes sense now

Even with speak set to true?
That is the configuration of your queue, you may have activated anonymous queue
-d anonymous queue
I redone the role
Maybe that was the issue

we're trying to use setstarting mmr with roles for each player before they join the queue so that the bot is balancing teams correctly from the get go, but it's not doing the correct mmr. I've tried resetting it and reapplying it and it still is not updating anyone's mmr
some roles do show the correct mmr but then some roles don't. is there a limit to how many roles you can set if u dont have premium?
Is it possible to have a multi-queue or adaptive queue? Where if there's only 8 queued players, you can launch the game as a 4v4 or if there's 10, you can do a 5v5 instead?
and is it possible to do with buttons? Where if there's 10 players, you can press a button for 4v4 or a different button for 5v5?
you could set that up with `forcestart` commands

hey,

NeatQueue was being used in a discord of mine and was working perfectly fine but then started giving error messages saying it didnt have permissions to manage channels anymore. So I looked at its permissions in the text channel and the discord server itself and it still has the permissions to manage channels in both. I took the permissions away and tried a force start and it gave me a personal message saying it didnt have perms which was good, but then I gave them back and forcestarted and it sends a message to the entire text channel instead of a personal one now. Can someone help me figure this out? I also have screenshots and tried ending and reloading the queue to no avail. Thanks!
hello, some players are not showing up oin the leaderboard, why is that

ok I got a problem when they cancel the match and then there might be ppl already on the queue, and when it's cancelled they all return and now I got more ppl on call than what it should be, and I already got so many problems with the join queue button so I just disabled it, and now the only way to join queue is via joining call, but if there's 13/10 ppl on call, it's impossible to start another game, and that's it, it's chaos cuz they Cancel games again and again

hey lads, got an issue with cancelling games. When doing `/cancel` It allows people to vote but once it hits 6 people it greys out like the image below and doesn't do anything after that. End up having to use `/outcome cancel`
did you modify your /requiredvotes cancel?
Hello, I would like to know how I can make my results channel only show the result of the match, after voting, because mine is still showing the voting, which should only occur on the channel from the queue
Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to have an option in the bot to make it so that instead of using @‚Äòs on the queue message, it uses user nicknames, cause looking at random numbers is kinda whack really
at least in my experience it *usually* doesn't show numbers and correctly shows the @s
-d resultschannel
thats the command but not quite sure what you are seeing, a screenshot might help
Happens alot in my queues, i think its usually when theres a lot of people in queue
I think a feature like that would add to the customization of the queue message
yea i can add a small command for that to /message queuemessage
On other servers I used, only the result appeared in the results channel, with voting only taking place in the queue's private channel.
Without this, voting should only happen on the queue channel (this and the results channel)
ok this message is from
-d staffchannel set
It worked, thanks.
With normal queue how do i skip the captains slectection etc and just go str8 to the game. As its only 1v1s

and pick Balanced

hola people, wondering how do i make it so each teams needs different amount of people and can only be entered with a specific role? thanks
the actual reason i asked for this is because every time i try to make it like this the /numberofteams keeps adding to teamsize instead
or am i wrong?
unfortunately its not possible to have teams of different sizes
so the image i showed is like a crypted or smth?
those are 2 teams of the same size using /roles
where each team has 1 Setter, 1 Middle Blocker, 1 Outside, 1 Opposite, 1 Libero
so youre telling me that uhh the 4 slot of outside shouldnt exist or am i bluffing
because this is pretty confusing
-d /roles
misread, it‚Äôs 1 Setter, 1 Middle Blocker, 2 Outside, 1 Opposite, 1 Libero
per team
btw can you make a specific role only able to fill some slots?
Just wondering if there was ever an update on this?
oh sure i can change it today
Thanks!

Is there a way for players with a requeue role to automatically be added to the queue when the match is ended?
there is not, although i feel like that might cause more harm than good right?
if it auto requeues and starts a match but someone didnt want to play again
Maybe link it to a role? That person is wanting to be automatically queued up, so it's on them
Is it possible to view who is in queue as an admin, when it is hidden for others?
Checked with ai-support and it says `/player list` although I don‚Äôt see any commands unless it has changed

you need to set your timer longer

How can i implement this? Is there a command?

To have a player lose MMR/ELO if they do not ready up in time, you can consider implementing a system where players who do not join the voice channel within a specified time frame are penalized with a deduction in MMR/ELO. This can help discourage players from delaying the queue process and ensure a smoother experience for all participants. Additionally, you may want to explore setting up a command or feature that automatically deducts MMR/ELO from players who consistently fail to ready up in time. If you need further assistance or guidance on how to implement this feature, I recommend reaching out in the <#868549627652214794> channel for more detailed support.

Hi, can I balance teams by win rate? It's like the balanced option, but instead of balancing by points, it balances by player win rate.
For the streak autorole (/autoroles streaks set [role] [lower_value] [upper_value] (only_one_allowed))

How do I get it so that if a player wins 3 games they get the role, but if they lose the game after that they'll lose the role.

I only want to give the streak role when players are on a winning streak and as soon as they lose it removes it
For now, I set the range to:
lower value = 3
upper value = 99

But that seems wrong. Should the uppervalue be 0?
The documentation is just a bit confusing on this (and most of the range autoroles). An example could be helpful in the docs üòõ
that should work i believe
there isn‚Äôt a way to set an ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù upper or lower bound so usually i would say just make it a huge number
Gotcha haha, I don't think they'll get to 99....
thanks neat

We have used /lobbychannel set channel but still when the game ends, it disconnects us

Pls help <@145305657237700608>
does it pull players from the lobby channel automatically?
Not exactly, an example:
The players enter the vc "Queue", we start the game and move everyone to the vc of the game where captain and players are selected
The game proceeds to be played
Finish the game and disconnect all players from that game

I would like you to return the "Queue" channel to the main channel üôÅ
`/lobbychannel returnall` should work

I will try to try it today
Also, if you have anything additional, I would appreciate it if you could tell me

btw which cypto you got to recieve or which crypto you use

anything i suppose
i dont know how to use the -drating mind helping me?
i cant understand
To sort of bounce an idea without any idea on how this works on your end, how do you make it to where setting your role to GK, healer, etc makes you queue up as that role automatically? Can you do something that makes it where someone with a role can't queue up automatically?
So there is `/role` which sets your preferred role
which means the role popup wont appear
you can also use /reactionsroles to auto assign a preferred role when reacting for a Discord role
Right. So how does it know that when you have that role, you automatically go to one spot of the embed? 

Would it be possible for someone to have a role that prevents them going to one spot?
mind helping?
the preferred role is just something tracked internally
adding some banned roles per user could be an idea though
that sounds pretty helpful
I'll <#911057745204105237> it
probably want
`/player role set` (set a specific user's preferred role
`/player role ban` (ban a user from picking a role)
`/player role unban` (unban from a banned role)
that should be quick, i can do it this weekend
Awesome!

I wanted to ask why am i (highest rated in the team) earns more MMR upon winning the game? Where can i edit where the higher MMR you get the less MMR you earn when winning? edit: sorry, i meant i lose less elo upon losing the game.
How come my stats are bugged like this when i have it set to 10 mmr per win? And everyone starts at 0
check your /info, the default starting mmr is 1000
if people queued before you changed the setting or it got reset, then that explains it
there are streak and placement multipliers, so it‚Äôs not always true that the highest rated player gains the least
Thank you! so the placement and streak multipliers matter. And it's editable?

If you set the lobbychannel set to that vc, they will be always dragged there
-d lobbychannel set
tyy‚ù§Ô∏è
<@145305657237700608> can i disable the /leaderboard command for members?
yes via the discord Server Integration settings
what is the command for changing the starting mmr for all players? <@145305657237700608>
and how to lock queue vc and team vc so that only queue and team players can join their respective voice channels, and not ppl who arent in the queue
-d startingmmr
thats by default
oo tyy!
One of my guys wasn't allowed to use the `/player role ban` command, even though I gave his role the permission to use it. Any idea why not?
that seems strange, i‚Äôll take a look
is it just a single person? or that whole staff role
Let me double-check
I think it's the role, as I'm able to use the command. I'm the server owner, though, if that matters
yea that would bypass these per command checks
I had another try it out with the same role, and it didn't work for them, either
Hello there is there any command that lets you request/change role after queueing?
<@145305657237700608>  DMS
i used the ai support channel asking if its possible to set a max elo for a party however the command it gave me does not work for me
Hello
Sorry for the inconvenience, I'm Brazilian and I wanted to know how my friend made a line like that.
Can anyone help me?
When I join the bot queue to start a game, it creates a voice channel that players are required to join. Is it possible to replace it with a text channel ?
will the stats and the queue settings reset if i use endqueue command? <@145305657237700608>
<@145305657237700608>
how do i fix this
you can have new text channels for each queue
-d tempchannels toggle
and disable the lobby VC
-d lobbychannel
-d roles
fix what

how I setup bot in my server  how I add Championships, points, rankings and voices
How can I set a time before the game starts when the queue is full? HELP PLS
/setup
In the api's leaderboard endpoint, I believe the rank # is one game behind whereas the mmr is always up to date.
is this a known bug?

I have 3 queues. I want it so that the MMR is the same for ecah queue, like they are linked, you gain mmr in one queue it will transfer to others. I enabled server wide mmr but I dont think it works am I missing something?
What do you mean? before the game cancels?
Pretty sure its ./timer afk
Yo uncle Neatz
Any chance you can verify if the bot is bugging <@145305657237700608>
Or u could restart it rq
what is problem <@145305657237700608>
Please uncle Neatz
Restart the bot
And save us all
<@648635725964902411>
Do you have acess to it?
And is Neatz NA?
Node 1 is down
I cant do anything, and bro is prob sleeping
But it should be up now
The node seems fine

You saved us

Don I have a question
i have 3 queues
2 v 2 and 5 v 5 work fine
The mmr of the two are linked
and I enabled serverwide sharing
but my 1v1 queue
Whenever I win or lose mmr
It doesnt link with the other two queues
Any idea why?
If you have serverwide enabled i dont see why it wouldnt be linked
Im not sure either maybe ill just recreate a queue, do you think it has something to do with the starting mmr?
I mean its set at the sasme for all 3 queues
can anyone help me with using neatqueue for setting up a 8s? after setting up, i tried to test the que and it says i need to create a party, with a captian and all that. i just want it to be able for any random 8 people to click join and when its full will be good to go
https://skinny-robe-29c.notion.site/NeatQueue-Full-Setup-Guide-2247971f644680268b54f1e688e8596e
How do I make it so people don‚Äôt get banned for not joining?
`/readyup mode mode:Disabled`
How do I start the test
If it‚Äôs just me
I just want to see how it looks
Just checking in on this, for why the role isn't able to use the command, even though I've given the ability to use it.
Our server is using a new plugin for map/mode selection that is tailored specifically to Halo Infinite. We have three running NQ queues currently. Is it possible to configure the queue to bypass map and mode altogether, but still do captain and team voting?
you can just remove all the maps
-d map remove
I was wondering about this. Good to know! I was hesitant to test it in case it didn't work. There are a lot of maps and readding them would have been a PITA.
would recommend just doing a `/config save` so you can always reload it
before removing them
Excellent idea. Our queues are always up 24/7, so I forget this even exists.
hm i think this will work
I made a new queue to just start on a new clean slate
but want to pull the stats from the old q's via api - I'm not positive on the old "queue names" though
sorry for such a late response lol
ok found the issue, its fixed now
i added maps and ran a match and they only worked once
Thsnks!
Hello <@145305657237700608> I have 2 questions:

1. How do players use `/substitute` because they always fail to interact even when someone wants to accept their substitute request?
2. Is there a feature in which a certain match can *Double Down* their MMR gains and losses for that one game?
Is there an option to post matchready messages when a game starts & not only results?
Similar to what we have with the Staffmessage, but more a compact version of this with the same clean look as the results one?
also for the history endpoint, the start_date query doesnt return matches that are on the same day
oh wrong channel oops
Hello is there any way a player can select two roles and get assigned to one of the role to fill the queue?
the leaderboard list collapses when refreshed, how to fix that <@145305657237700608>
bot down?
<@145305657237700608>
What to do in such a case? It doesn't want to do anything, doesn't get out of the queue.
`/player role ban` doesn't work in the same channel that `/role` works in. Is that a bug, or something? The only channel people can use it in is the same channel as the active queue. It won't work in any channels linked to the queue, either.
that‚Äôs purely the autocomplete, it only autocompletes for the queue
it should autocomplete for linked queues though
regardless, you can still ban any role even if it doesn‚Äôt autocomplete
Just tried it in a running queue
Ah, so I can just type in GK, and it'll work?
i‚Äôll fix that though
Awesome. Thanks!
<@145305657237700608> how can i enable who is in the queue like joined queue how cnai see that
<#1131752660740083763> isnt helping me with this or smthng
not sure if i have something set up wrong, but originally the nq bot was deleting its categories after the match was completed.  it is now leaving the discord like this where i have to do a manual cleanup. any suggestions?
Since i didnt get a response i guess i'll have to ask again.

Hello NeatZ I have 4 questions:

1. How do players use /substitute because they always fail to interact even when someone wants to accept their substitute request?
2. Is there a feature in which a certain match can Double Down their MMR gains and losses for that one game?
3. Is there any way a player can select two roles and get assigned to one of the role to fill the queue?
4. Is there any way to let the player know if they are in queue or in line for an anonymous queue setup?
can someone help me
my bot is not doing the mmr calculations correctly
after the last vote for an map
there is another vote
how can I change this ?
since the map is alrdy choosen
nvm I figured it out
Is there a way to disable the buttons in the match history for certain roles ?
-d anonymousqueue
could you share your config? /config save
1) What do you mean fail to interact?
2) Not automatically, but you can change the /mmr change on demand
3) Unfortunately not
4) With anonymous queues there is a status button to check if you are in queue or not
only staff can use those buttons, what are you trying to do?
How can I set who is staff and who isnt ? Or is it the admin role on the discord
by default its the manage channels perm which signifies staff
Nice thank you it works
Just another question, or maybe more of a feature request if it isn‚Äôt in already.
I‚Äôm planning to extend the queue and open it up to 10k+ players, and one concern I have is about MMR. When pros play, the enemy team usually loses the same amount of MMR as in a normal match. Is there a way to make it so that the team without the pro takes a less impactful hit to their MMR?
how do i share the config with you?
I saved the config. Unsure how you want me to show you so you can see?
yo
would anyone be down to help me with the bot in my cord
having some trouble setting up some things
i already asked the ai
but still kinda of confusing to me
Yeah any update on this by chance? Thanks!
Players can sub themselves, how can I disable this?
here is what i mean by fail to interact
<@145305657237700608> is it possible to host an instance of discord neatqueue bot on my own shard / server? because sometimes the neatqueue bot goes down and i would like to host it using my own resources
Is it possible to set up different temp roles for the position selected in the queue? For example: there are two positions players can select in the queue. Skater and goalie. We dont want goalies being captains. We also dont want trickery within implementing a banned role that people react to just so they arent captain. So individual roles that are granted once a player joins queue in a specific position then removed after the game.
It might be nice if there was a way to sync the queue role with a Discord role via /autoroles
the only way i can think of achieving what you want is with /reactionroles assigning discord roles + preferred queue roles at the same time
but its kindy hacky to rely on that
unfortunately  not, im working on allowing custom instances though
<@145305657237700608> I can't log in into the dashboard to upgrade, can I get further assistance?
what‚Äôs happening?
Does a cancel of an game add an lose to the scoreboard ?
Can I get some help please <@145305657237700608>
if you saved the config you can just send the code here or to me
the code from the config list?
i called it 'chad help'
lets say a game need 10 people to get created and there are 10 people in the matchmaking queue with different kind of mmr does `/matchmaking leniency` has a cap or does it go up infinite until it creates the game ?
there‚Äôs no cap, it will just keep slowly increasing its threshold for a valid match
i‚Äôll check it out tomorrow <:thumb:711064979012321290>
thank you
Anyone know if balancebyroles works properly or not? It seems to go in descending order instead of balancing it so that the sums of the role values on each team are as close to equal as possible.
Like it seems to split the teams from highest to lowest, (1, 2, 3, 4) vs (5, 6, 7, 8), while ideal would be (1, 8, 2, 7) vs (3, 4, 5, 6)
Players can sub themselves, how can I disable this? <@145305657237700608>
i dont have this command
''/subselftoggle''
whenever I try to log-in in the website it takes me back to the main page and doesn't log me in
and the leniency is starting when the queue has a enough players to create a game ?
hi everyone when neatqueue says only 3 queues are available does that mean 3 open queues or just 3 queues in general?
3 queues in genral on your discord server
i see... so i have to pay to get more queues?
hmm any other bot that dosent have restriction ?
no idea, but this one is pretty good üôÇ what are you planning to do ?
making a 10 mans server for valorant for people who want more compeitive games with communication
maybe think about it make the queue mmr based so you could use it for different ranks üôÇ
and then add a seperate pro queue for example
yeah i have 3 queues rn and a pro one
dont need more than 3 queues for one region
oh really?
thats how I do it yea
what if alot people plays
at once
you get only 50 games per day in the free version
ohhh
the 4 dollar one is like 150 games
and 16$ is 1000 daily matches
so if you also need some money and you get so many games just ask the community to donate
ohh i see
ok sure thanks alot for the help
no problem
by region u meant  the whole APAC rigjt?
right
My server is for EU atm
but I want to open up to world wide
rainbow six siege game
how does the mmr work?
how do u assign who gets how much mmr
ask in here <#1131752660740083763> it gives good answers

Yo guys
I‚Äôm going to use an example I made 4 options for a queue and there is tank,dps support and I want there to be only 2 tanks per team and 3 dps per team and 2 support per team
I don‚Äôt know how to add a specified amount of votes on an option
<@145305657237700608>
Will you be able to help?
are /api/queue/{channel_id}/players, /api/queues/{server_id}/players, and /api/queuechannels/{server_id} no longer supported?
Just add the roles multiple times in the command like dps,dps, dps,tank,tank, support, support
Which command do I use
/roles tank,tank and so on
It shows roles have been disabled
For some reason
use the <#1131752660740083763> its really good
hiiiii
I only have 2 queues in my server and apparently I can have 3 but its saying i already have 3? hulp
i have error code mjzdh what do i do]

Indeed bot is down
anyone know when the bot will be back up?

no it doesnt
oh nevermind ?
Nahh for some weird reason all the maps got delete as soon as I hit end queue
it doesnt do that for me idk
could someone tell me how to allow gamemode map bans? I have made 3 "gamemodes" which are 3 different map pools and I want it to be a randomised map pool pick then a map ban vote on top however when I add a map ban number it changes the map bans.

Gamemodes:

pool1 - Skyscraper, Kafe Dostoyevsky, Nighthaven Labs, Clubhouse, Border

pool2 - Skyscraper, Kafe Dostoyevsky, Nighthaven Labs, Clubhouse, Chalet

pool3 - Skyscraper, Kafe Dostoyevsky, Nighthaven Labs, Clubhouse, Lair

when i have added maps like that so it randomises the map pool (gamemode) it works but both teams have to choose a map. I want them to ban 2 maps for a decider map if anyone can help me
user commands only means all non-admin/staff only neatqueue commands
ending a queue deletes all settings with it
you can reload the config with /config
setting /map bans should just work i imagine? what‚Äôs not working
So /map bans changes on how the game mode works I‚Äôll send screenshots in a sec with anc without enabling bans
without map bans (when votes put in it selects the map and not bans it)
adds 2 extra maps in and then does bans when /map bans is enabled
thats when you choose to "ban" the map
how many map bans do you have set?
So the game map pool for pro league has 9 maps. I want to cut it down to 5 random pro league maps but due to the bot not having that option I have to make 126 pools as  game modes with each map having to be inputted 70 times
leaderboard not showing anything
its not showing only mmr section others its showing perfectly fine
did you have a chance to look?
Same issue
<@145305657237700608>
happened to me when i hit the refresh button in middle. page i refreshed was gone but other pages still worked.  i fixed by changing leaderboard to text then back to image

How do i give my members to us ONLY user neatqueue commands without giving them permissions to use other bots cause when i give them perms to use commands in a channel they can warn people with carl bot for example
Pls help
<@145305657237700608>
That is not really related to the bot, by default, normal users can only use users commands
The owner removed all my roles and only gave me permissions to use commands in a channel and i could warn someone whose role was below me
looking for help in stopping the bot from forcing us into a different vc and then seperating us, is this a possibility and if so how do i go about it?
need help, the bot says the game already started, which indicates a queue is active but there isn't one active
Those involve: `/voicechannels teamchannels` and `/lobbychannel toggle`
I want remove thes
-d teamselection
./teamselection set
So on my server I want people that play ranked games to have their mmr in their name. For some people the mmr shows but others it doesn‚Äôt. How do I fix this?

I want people that don‚Äôt play ranked games to continue to have no mmr in their name
ive also noticed this. works on like 80% of people
Am I able to make the box smaller more professional looking
by default people only get MMR in their name when they queue
also if the bot is able to nickname them
no you can‚Äôt style it much
how to check transcript of any queue
How can I individually set player MMRs I have tried everything for instance mine is 1200 someone else is 1250 someone else is 1300 etc. when I do /set MMR the dropdown only shows my name and no one else in the server. I also try to @ and just my name shows up. I‚Äôm stuck
when you use /set mmr user: you can pick anyone in the server, just start typing their name if they don‚Äôt pop up
you need to setup a staff channel
-d staffchannel set
i have that
I only have myself and two bots on the drop down list I can‚Äôt click on anyone other than me and those two bots. I just want to individually set everyone‚Äôs MMR/rank in my server to make the teams fair when a game starts.
As mentioned, just type the name of the user you want to change the mmr
It doesn‚Äôt work I am the only one listed in the drop down along with the bot
Are you typing the user's name you want to change its mmr?
And it doesnt appear?
Yep exactly I‚Äôll do @ and no one is available to select on the dropdown
Can you record a video of how youre doing it
Interesting wrenches and Kimble just randomly popped up - same thing with jocoo but yeah still a very short list.
Youre not doing what neatz and i told you, just type the name of the user, no matter if it doesnt pop up
Invalid Integer
Type the user, in the user parameter
What do you mean the user parameter
Just tap the "user" gray box, and type
Oh in there, it still didn‚Äôt work.
Can someone help me? The images are not showing up on the leaderboard
only by mmr and peak mmr, but if I put games the image appears
<@648635725964902411> <@145305657237700608>
I just want to individually set the ranks or MMR but when I try to do it only a couple people pop up in the drop down and when I do @ their name it won‚Äôt submit it says invalid integer
here‚Äôs an example
Tbh i dont know why it sometimes do that
but there is no way to reappear?
Yes I wish it was working like that for me but it isn‚Äôt that‚Äôs a lot of choices and players to set MMRs for I‚Äôd like the same please but it‚Äôs not working/looks like that. What should I do? I appreciate the video, very helpful and #goals ü§£
Not sure
If you click the name of the leaderboard you have a web leaderboard tho
only things would be update/restart discord since these are discord internals
i have no control over how those user inputs work
Very good idea I had an update but even after that I was not able to accomplish individually setting MMRs or the dropdown 20+ names
I figured it out, you have to do the user first then come back and do the MMR - right to left action not left to right. Pin this or note it üëÄüß†
How do I get it to 

#1 - Stop auto making a Queue? For example match starts Queue #9 another starts Queue #10 - is there a way to disable the auto Queue names?

can someone help?
you can specify roles multiple times
like: WS,WS,DS,DS
1) not sure what you mean, a queue starts when it fills up
<@857633321064595466> stats
> ### How stats for a queue are linked
> In NeatQueue, player stats are stored via a unique name. This lets you link queues together for sharing stats, or separating across queues (Example: Rocket League Queue and Overwatch Queue both have independent stats).
> 1) If `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats serverwide` is enabled, that is the unique name that is used for all queues, so all queues see the same stats.
> 2) Otherwise, if `/leaderboardconfig sharedstats set` is set, that is the unique name to use for just this channel's queue. Any queue with this same unique stats name will see the same stats.
> 3) Otherwise, the queue name is used as the unique name.
for 2)
3) you cannot
Thx man
I feel kinda dumb now üò≠
all good it‚Äôs a very common question, should update the command docs
Figured out #2
still not sure about #1 - would be nice to rename it to Match instead of Que if I can disable it saying Queue #

#3 removing the timestamp; no luck I can‚Äôt figure that out.
Would also be nice to be able to change this line
the things you are looking at are staff only messages from your /staffchannel
purely for admins to track matches
Is there a way to make the auto balance teams option, balance by going by higest mrr, in a snake draft type fashion. For example if these 10 players were in the queue (player 1 being the top and player 10 being the bottom) and auto balance was the team selection is there a way to make it so for team 1 it would be players 1,4,5,8,9and team 2 would be 2,3,6,7,10. Basically an auto snake balance feature
Yes I am an admin I‚Äôd like everyone in the Que be able to see that match info and if possible change USA (Axis) NA - to something else
How is this possible and how do i fix it?
<@145305657237700608> theres an issue where if you load a config (with custom url) from one server onto a different server without premium, the leaderboard is set to show the previous servers stats
so unless you get premium and change it again, wont work
how do i create a config?
on my own
good find, will fix that
Just customize your queue then do /config save
I made a tournament with 20 people, bot only supports 12 each tournament, what do ido?
Hey so we're using the bot for a decent sized server (2000+ members) and it's not updating some of the players rank roles when they rank up
is there a solution to this or is it just a bug?
do you have the autorole feature on for points or mmr
is the bots role higher than all of the players roles in the discord role hierarchy
what is going on? you can definitely do larger tournaments
my tournament had 21 ish registered members and it only did 12
Now im making another in 2 hours, hopefully doesnt happen the same
is this supposed to happen? 5th 5th 5th
double 3rd players
this is weird
it's right below admin
if you run /autoroles refresh does it fix?
<@145305657237700608> There's still an issue with our server's leaderboard. If set to images, it keeps crashing every 4-5 tries later.

my queue-# channels appear at the top of a persons server list. Any way i can remove that
Wdym at the top of server list?
showing as ‚Äúsuggested‚Äù
Is it cause i switched to a new server?
By default channels will be created in the category the queue is
Yeah that ik but its still showing up
But it may be because its new server i don't know
i have the onboarding settings to have the category followed by default as well
Yeah probably a discord side issue
https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/s/LHHGXyN26H

Is there a way to give two roles for autoroles ingame? I gave one role that allows the players to drag members to their vc, then tried to add a second that gives them a role that has a win multiplier to give 4 stacks less elo. When I added the second multiplier role it removed the drag role.
Also is there a way to keep someones mmr when they leave the server and join back? Because right now in my server someone starts at 1000, if they go down to like 700 they can just leave server and it puts them back at 1000 when they rejoin?
how does the placement games work ? How does the multiplier work , how much do you X get win or how much does the elo getting multiplied ?
Same for the streaks
<@226360861223026688>
What about the winning streak multiplier ? And what if I got another role multiplier, does it stack up ?
Its set by `/mmr multipliers set`, so it depends on that commans
For the second question, im not sure tbh
no I meant the inbuild streaks multiplier, it dosent say anywhere how much extra you get

/mmr multipliers streaks
Go to the message of neatz to see whats the default for the first 10 games, second if you see the description of the command `/mmr multipliers streak` it says *if there exists*
So if you set a multiplier, with mmr multipliers set, then that command will have effect based on the set multiplier
Ahhhh
So If I set multipliers for roles then they have effect if I enable it with /mmr multipliers streaks ? Thats interesting, thank you for the help! üôÇ
But thats then so confusing because it says "If there exists a multiplier for win/loss streaks."
and `/mmr multipliers set` means that:
Sets the MMR multiplier for the given role for wins.
Yes, but just think it of configuration command, and enabling command
But i do get it could have been some wording to say "Set the MMR multiplier for the given role for wins, which can be enabled/disabled with this other command" type thing
yea its for sure misleading
I will give it a go
NeatZ did have the idea to make some type of community docs where everyone could suggest changes to it, i think its a good idea
acctually I just checked
I got 
Multipliers
Streaks: Disabled

and the multipliers for roles are working anyway. SO the `/mmr multipliers streak` is not for the roles , it is for the streaks <@648635725964902411>
hmmm
<@145305657237700608> When i have 2 separate queues using the voice channel entry method. If i join one queue vc, then join the other, it wont remove me from the previous queue. So im queued in both places
Hi! Having a bit of an issue with the /timer afk command. I tried to set it up multiple times but still, it kicks out inactives even though I toggled it off.
How to disable this?
i want the teams forced in 1v1
no need to choose or validate team mates
Also, how do i setup to send a message in temporary channels, like rules.
-d teamselection reshuffle
Theres not really option for that, the closest thing would be /lobbydetails set
How does /schedule setup work
i dont know how to setup the time value and timezone
like for everyday
-d schedule time add
after you setup a scheduled command, you can add execution times
Can you give examples of time:
do i say like time: 8
or like 8h
what does that mean even
and on timezone should it be like: GMT+1
or somthg?
if you use the command it has autocomplete
with times and timezone options
the options are blank for me...
oh nvm, its fixed now
Is there only africa timezones?
Hello, how do you make it so the Auto Captains are chosen automatically instead of manually? i'd appreciate any help <3
no just type in your time zone
-d captain selection
<@145305657237700608> hey, sorry for the ping. can you tell me please how much elo you get extra for the `/mmr multipliers streak` or how much the multiplier is. Also when is it active ?
Why does the bot do this instantly? i dont want this
it appears whenever a queue is started. are my queues broken
it created like 150 queues channels
i dont wanna have to keep deleting them all
it also creates extra vc queue#327
there‚Äôs a limit to how many channels the bot can create in a server per day so it reuses them
if you delete them the bot might stop working in your server for up to 24 hours
I had deleted them
there‚Äôs a small multiplier for increasing win streaks, at 2 wins it‚Äôs only 1.04x
theres a loss streak multiplier as well, which is even smaller
any ideas to make this work?
so you want to randomly select 5 maps?
effectively yes from a 9 map pool. but from the five maps the bots selected a vote goes in place to ban maps with it so 1 map is left
if you don‚Äôt want map bans you can disable it
but map bans happen before map selection
I‚Äôd assume the streak multiplier doesn‚Äôt override the role multiplier. For example, if a role has 0.5√ó and the streak is 1.04√ó, it wouldn‚Äôt replace the 0.5√ó but instead add the extra 0.04√ó to it right ?
they all multiply together
Is it possible to make it so that each role in the queue (like forward,defender,goalie) can have a unique amount of people that can queue into that role.
How do i make the stats and MMR stays and not reset upon new month?
How to make the game mode RANDOM AUTO PICK only?
-d leaderboardconfig monthly toggle
-d teamselectoon set
I set my captains system to balanced + a priority role with /captains role
but it wont give priority to the captains role
Did the priority role change to where it also includes people above priority mmr?
Changed it to highest mmr picking but it also picked someone non priority but higher mmr
how do i remove the channel voice limit
Our leaderboard is broken.
how to remove gameselection i have 2
does this commands get copied between configurations? `/channel name queuelocked channel_name:`, `/schedule`
<@145305657237700608> how would you recommend I go about having my discord bot reward players a currency for a win off of staffchannel match results?

I thought of having each user link their neatqueue ID but it doesn‚Äôt show easily on the embedded
